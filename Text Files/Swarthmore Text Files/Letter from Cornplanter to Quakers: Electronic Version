 To the children of the Friends of Onas who first set- 
led in Pennsylvania -- The request of the Cornplanter a 
 chief of the Seneca nation 
 Brothers, The Seneca nation see that the Great spirit 
 intends that they shall not continue to live by hunting, 
 and they look round on every side, and enquire who it 
 is that shall teach them what is best for them to do. 
 Your Fathers have dealt fairly and honestly with 
 our Fathers, and they have charged us to remember 
 it, and we think it right to tell you, that we 
 wish our children to be taught the same principes 
 by which your fathers were guided in their councils. Brothers, 
 We have too little wisdom among us: 
 We cannot teach our children what we perceive their 
 situation requires them to know, and we therefore 
 ask you to instruct some of them We wish them to be 
 instructed to read and to write, and such other things 
 as you teach your children; and especially, to teach 
 them to love peace. Brothers, 
 We desire of you to take under your 
 care two Seneca boys and teach them as your own; 
 and, in order that they may be satisfied to remain with 
 you and be easy in their minds, that you will take 
 with them the son of our Interpreter and teach him 
 also according to his desire. Brothers, 
 You know that it is not in our power to 
 pay
 pay you for the education of these three boys -- and therefore you 
must, if you do this thing, look up to God for your reward. Brothers,
You will consider of this request, and let us 
know what you determine to do. If your hearts 
are enclined toward us, and you will afford our nation 
this great advantage, I will send my son as one of the 
boys to receive your instruction, and at the time which 
you shall appoint. His Corn Planter mark
