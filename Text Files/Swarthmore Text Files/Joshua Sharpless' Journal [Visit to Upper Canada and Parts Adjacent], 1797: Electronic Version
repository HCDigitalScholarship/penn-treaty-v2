 On the 12th day of the 10th Mo 1797 after 
an humbling time with my dear Wife
 and Children, I left home in order to
 Join a Committee of our last Yearly
 Meeting appointed the to Visit some friend
 in upper Canada and parts adjacent,
 my Dear Wife bearing me company
 as far as my soninlaw Benjamin
 Cooke’s, I went that Evening to Na
 then Sharples’s where by agreement
 I met with Jacob Lindley and James
 Wilson two of the aforementioned Com-
-mittee. 13th a pleasent Morning the Wind South-
-erly, dined at John Scarlet s in the
 forest 20 miles, pased over a rough
 hilly country up the waters of the Brandy-
-wine, much of the Land thin tho che-
-quered with some good plantations
 pretty well improved, pased through
the East end of Little Connestoga Valley 
a fruitful spot, the hills about the forest 
very steep, and in places covered with 
stones, from scarlet’s to Schuylkill 5 miles 
 continued very rough, thence up the 
Schuylkill to Reading 4 miles, the town is situ
-ated on a low piece of Ground near 
the sd river, surrounded with high hills 
the place is by no means elegant. nei-
-ther did the town look thriving or 
lively, from thence to Pennose Wiley ’s 
goes, over near Maiden Creek where we 
lodged, over a pretty fruitful Coun-
-try and beautiful road 9 miles. 14 and 1st of the week a Northwest Wind and plesant day, 
attended Maiden creek Meeting, who 
which upon the whole was a refresh-
-ing time, Dined at John Starrs near 
the Meetinghouse, having me last 
Evening with Oliver Paseton , and 
this Morning with James Lang
staff two friends of our Number 
making up now five in all, after 
a comfortable Opportunity at John 
Starrs, we off towards Munsy 
 in about three Miles, upon a con-
-siderable eminence, we had a 
bold and noble view of the Blue 
Mountain at about 8 miles distance.
 with an elegant Valley between, the 
View was truly beautiful and pic-
-terisque as far as the Eye could 
reach, both to the East and West, and 
the Mountain in front raising its 
lofty head in a Majestick and de-
-lightful Manner, thence 5 miles to ham-
-burgh now Carters a smart town, thence among 
the Mountain up the Side of the 
Schuylkill where the prospect was 
will and romantick and in 5 or 6 
miles opened to a fine plantation 
on one branch of the Schuylkill 
where we took up our quarters in 
a good habitation in the possession of 
Michal Mosyer the road for the most 
part pretty good. 16 checkPlace Started by brake of day, a clear
 white-frosty-morning, 7 miles 
of good road, come to the second 
Blue Mountain, passed through 
a gap where a small branch of 
the Schuylkill has it course, the gap 
in places was narrow, and the 
 on each side very steep and 
high, covered with a thick crust 
of Stones, thence in some 2 or 3 miles 
crossed the Tuscarora Mountain, 
on the North Side of which there is 
an amazing prospect, a very 
great Valley in front extending 
from east to West as far as the Eye 
could reach, about 2 or three miles 
off over said Valley there was a 
lofty towring Mountain, or one 
Mountain upon the top of a-
-nother whose proud crest tops reach-
-ed the Sky, the appearance was 
truly Magestick and Bold, and 
so diversifyed with many enliv-
-ening coulours that the pros-
-pect was picturesque and beau-
-tiful, we then passed the 
 Mountain which was very high, 
next the Broad Montain which
 was inferior to none, then
 we came to the Mahony Moun-
-tain, the prospect from the 
Northside of which was much
 like that of Tuskorora, tho the abiss
 or Valley was deeper and more di
rectly down beneath our feet, per
haps 400 feet, the next Mountain 
was called the little Mountain 
tho thought to be higher then any 
of the rest, the Assent and decent 
from those mountains are not very steep 
tho couvered with large and 
small stone, the road from 
thence to Catewisseeis most of 
it very rough, lodged at John Loyd s 
40 miles, the Land from Hamburgh 
to this place is chiefly Mountanious, 
Poor, and Stony, and very little set-
-tled, there are a number of Settleme
-ments about in Roring Creek Valley 
yet the face of Ground, appears thin 
Stony, and not desirable. 17 checkPlace Crossed Susquehanna at Catewissee in the 
boat, the River 80 pearches wide, 
the Land from the River to fishing 
Creek is more desirable than on the 
Catewisee side, it is pretty clear of 
Stones, and mostly such as will do 
to settle on, and in some places, 
particularly toward Fishing Creek 
is considerably improved, Dined 
at Jessee Hains ’s 15 miles, the tim-
-ber for 7 or 8 miles after we crossed 
the River, is mostly Pine, thinly scat-
-tered with very little undertimber, 
about Fishing Creek very heavy 
timber, from Jessee Haines ’s on 
towards Munsy generally White 
Oak, for 6 or 7 miles the Land leavel
 and pretty good with a number 
of good improvement, from thence 
to the Muncy Creak Creek Mountainous, and
 poor, the Muncy Valley is pretty good 
Land, Lodged at William Ellises 
 three Miles over Muncy Creek, 33 
Miles this day, this days travel pretty 
good Roads and clear of Stones 18 checkPlace a fine morning, and pleasant day 
for traveling, stoped, and took an ear-
-ly Dinner at the Widdow Harreses * at 
 *On Roasted and Baked Venison, persons having killed 3 the day before and 20 this fall 
Loyalsock 9 miles, thence up the Banks 
of Susquehanna to Lycomun 6 miles, 
then we turned a North Coarse of up the sd. 
Lycomun 10 miles to Skylers, among the 
Mountains, where we Lodged, the Road
 from William Ellis ’s to Lycomun, is thr
 Level, clear of Stones, and very good, the 
timber a Mixture of White Oak, Pitchpine, 
&c, and the Land in general very good. 
Up the Lycomun the road to this place 
crossed the Creek 7 times, the bottom we 
went up Deep and furtile, with some a 
few Cabbins & a little improved in places 
the valley was narrow with high moun-
-tains on each side, this bottom was 
very heavy timbred abundance of 
lofty White pine, butternut, button 
Wood, Sugar Maple &c. 19 checkPlace Set of[f] Just at breck of day, a fine morn-
-ing, fed at the foot of the Laural hill 
on the uppermost branch of Lycomun 
9 miles the Road deep and Miry up 
a Branch of the Lycomun, which we 
crossed upwards of 20 times, I have 
had this morning to admire the produc-
-tions of nature the remarkable Lofty towring 
pines, the Hemlock, spruce, Sugar 
Maple, and a Variaty of other Lofty 
timber, no man to recieve and carry
 them it of so that they fall into their Mother 
lap, the earth, and the multitudes of trunks of 
Trees that lye across one another is 
truly admiral, many of the White 
pine trunks appears to have lain 
in that Situation for more than half 
a Century, grown over with moss, the 
Seeds of the trees falling of on the Moss
 have taken Root, grew to be trees 5 or 6 
Inches over, while the Log under them
 remained, the Valley through which we 
passed is narrow with very high moun-
-tains on each they all appear very rich 
 and Cloathed with an Admirable load 
of Timber, so that a person who have has not 
been acquainted with such an Appearance
 would scarcely be able to form a Just Idea. 
We now then mounted, the Laural Hill, which proved 
Very high. we first passed through a Ches[t]-
- nut Ridge about 2m then entred a 
Vast Forrest of Hemloch, Spruce &c
 so thick that tho a clear day yet it ap-
-peared like the Dusk of the Even-
-ing, we presently in a few miles 
came unto passed through a very great Quantity 
of Sugar Maple, many of them from 
2 to 3 or 3½ feet over 40, 50, and 60 
feet fit for Sawing, also a vast Quanty 
of beach and Berch, fed at the 
Blockhouse 9 miles on a Branch 
of Pine Creek, from thence to 
a Branch of Tyoag River where 
we [?] 10 miles thence to Lambs 
on the side of sd. River 15 miles 
 the timber continuing Very so 
heavy all the way, great over
grow Hemlacks, many of which whom would 
make 5 or 6000 feet of Boards 
and great Burdens of White 
pine in place many of Whose where 
100 feet high with out Limbs, the 
curiosity through this days tra-
-vel in beholding the timber, and 
face of the ground was such, that 
I could scarcely keep mine Eyes 
from runing too and frow in 
beholding the Wonders of nature, 
many places the Trunks of Trees 
were laying across one another 3 or four feet high so that it ap-
-peared impossible to ride through 
the Woods, this day has been fatague
-ing both to Man and Beast, the Roads 
were chief mostly very miry particular
 ly in places very stony, full of Roots 
particularly the first 27 miles, night 
overtook us before we got into 
and the Road being covered with thick 
Pines it was very dark, so that we 
were truly thankful when we saw 
the glimmers of Light at our dis-
-tined part made their appearance, tho we found it a very 
Poor Tavern, having little nothing but Mush 
and Milk the Mush made of meal for 
Pounded in a Mortar, and the fare of 
our Horses not much better yet we were
 thankful we fared so well in the Wilderness 
having this day in the Course of 43 miles 
passed by but three cottages and them mean, 6th day 20 met with a trial this morning 
two of our horses having broke out of our 
poor Stable, but in three Miles rid-
-ing they were taken and brought 
back, a Cold frosty morning and 
like for snow, but grew warmer 
and rained a little in the evening 
this has been a pleasant days travel
 the road led down by the side of 
 of the Tyago River through a very 
furtile Vally with a few Cabbins and 
some little improvements for the first 
twelve Miles, the River, we Crossed 
frequently crossed as the Road suit-
-ed, the it glaides along in a Most be 
beautiful manner, not impeaded 
by Rocks, or Cataracks, we finally 
crossed it about one two miles above the 
Widow Lindsly’s , and in less than 
one Mile we crossed nearly another 
Branch as beautiful and nearly as 
large called the as the former and got our Breakfast we then stoped 
& fed our selves and horses at the Wi-
-dows, and were much pleased with 
our repast, having had nothing
 since we Left the Widow Harresses 
besides what our bags afforded except 
two indiffirent suppers, here we 
got Excellent green Tea, and Loaf 
Sugar, with Some choice Venision 
Stakes, taken out of a famous fat 
Buck which had been just killed not yet could 
 since killed to this stage 12 miles. 
We still went down sd River, over 
very fine fat bottoms, in about 8 
miles crossed Cannosto a very beau
tiful strem stream, then in 4 miles 
more we crossed Conhocton as beau
tifull a stream as another any of 
the former, the smallest of those stream†s
 are nearly as large>r as than Brandywine
 Stoped to feed at the painted Post 12 miles 
but but had nothing Suitable, thence 
to Mud Creek to John Dolso’s where 
we Lodged 12 miles the Road has been 
in the main pretty good, to the paint
-ed post very good. 21 checkPlace Stoped and took breakfast at 
William Kerseys 5 miles, he had nei
ther Hay, Corn, or Oates for our horses Lives in 
a small Log house in the Woods by 
a Curious Lake, of about 50 acres it 
is surrounded by a hard gravelly bank, 
has no Stream that runs either in>to it 
or out, continues nearly the same 
fulness of all Seasons, and abound[s] 
with various kinds of Fish, went to 
Bath miles there fed our horses 2 mile 
 within two miles of this Town seve-
-ral Large and elegant Buildings made 
their appearance, which after passing 
through more than 100 miles of Wil/-
-derness where there were but a few 
stragling Cabbons to be seen, where
 enlivenings, the town of Bath stands on 
a low piece of Ground near on the 
North Side of Conhocton Creek consisting of
 about 60 dwellings some of which are 
no discredit to the place, here we fed 
our Horses 6 miles, the Road from mud 
Creek runs pretty much under the 
South side of a Mountain is in places 
Stony, and other places very Miry 
 the and Land thin at Bath we council
led enquired of with some knowing men which 
way we had better take for the best 
to go to Niagara haveing it in 
prospect to go through Williams-
-burgh it being out nearest Rout, 
but they informed us there was only 
a small Indian path that way and 
that we had better go by the way of 
 Canadarque and at that the directest 
road there, was so Miry that we had 
better go by Jemima Wilkinson’s 
settlement, which was so far round 
that our minds became closely 
exercised to know what was best 
to do, but upon closely attending 
to the subject, and taking the 
that part of our appointment of
 Visiting those of our society about Can
adarque and parts & parts adjacent into view are 
felt most easy to turn our Course 
towards what is called Jemima 's the friends
 settlement, tho it was much about, 
it was a solitary road, there being 
but a few settlements , and those two or three 
expected, were within four Miles of 
Bath the rest of the way an entire 
Wilderness, the Land for a few Miles
 from Bath was a high dry soil and thin the 
Timber Chiefly pitch pine the soil 
thin thence through a low fat Bottom 
very swampy, thence over the North end of 
Mountain’ beautifully Timbered, not very 
 stony but excellent Wheat Land, to Sanfords 
15 miles, where we got Hay, and very indif.
-firent Oates in the sheaf, thence along the 
East side of the Crooked Lake ever a level 
Country, and for the most part good 
Land, for miles togather, a deep Rich 
Soil abounding with Sugar Maple, 
Shelbark Hickory, Ash, Elm, White Oak 
&c: mostly a White Oak Timber the Last 
20 Miles, a few White Pine in pplaces, 
to Thomas Lees a kind friendly Family 
16 miles, this has been a hard days, tra-
-vel for our Horses, and there fare very poor, 
there was no place to Quarter, short 
of where we arrived, that we were 
Obliged to travel hard, this has been 
a dark Cloudy day tho not much rain 1st day of the week 22nd checkPlace a rainy Morning &
 drisley day, in conference this Morning 
it was thought best, not to travel 
till afternoon, and as there was no 
friends Meeting in these parts, we felt 
an Opening to sit down with the 
family in which we were, with such 
 of the neighbors who were free to 
come, there being but a few within 
reach, the Opportunity was sensibly 
owned, the Lords Heavely Power 
Overshadowing to our Comfort & 
the Contrition and humbling of 
most that were present were we parted
 with them in much nearness, went to one 
Potters Judge Potters who kindly 
took us in, he lives in a very 
Elegant House Building which after riding 
5 or 6 Miles without seeing scarcely a house:
 to see such a Supurb one rising 
in the Woods begot admiration. 2nd day 23 a pleasant Morning, set of[f]
 for Canadarque, the road mostly throu gh
 the Woods, and in places deep, stoped an[d] 
fed at Gilberts 8 miles, in 5 miles farther 
we came on the bank of Canadarque 
Lake, which was enlivening, and look
ed beautiful thence up the side of the Lake 
to the place where it ran out of its outlet which stream 
was as Large as a pretty Creek Clever Creek
 thence up a beautiful ascending stre†[ch]
 about a mile stands to Canadarque thou[gh] 
is it contains a Number of well built Houses perhaps so some 
 of us elegant, and supurb, here we fed >10 mil†[es?] 
upon confering together we thought 
best of going to see some of our mem
bers hereaway upon and enquiring of our 
Landlord he informed us of one or one more 
who Lived at Mud Creek about 10 or 12 miles
 off, we then turned our faces that way 
and in about 9 m traveling 
we stoped at a certain Job Howlings 
to enquire the way, he told us it was 
to far to reach that evening and a kind-
-ly invited us to stay all night, which we 
accepted of, found his Wife a Member and very kind 
we had a sitting with them that even-
ing, the Land from Thomas Lees to 
Canadarque is in some places very 
rich strong land in other places thin, 
much of the way is Low flat Country Land 
to wet for Wheat, but little pine for 
20 m past the mostly heavy timbered. 
From Canadarque to this place very 
Deep, rich Land, for the most part, the 
 Very flat and wet, the greater body 
of Timber chiefly Elm, breech, & Sugar maple 
27 miles. 3d 24, checkPlace in conferrence this Morning it open-
-ed with greatest clearness to appoint a Meeting 
to be held next day at Nathan Herringdan ’s a 
Friendly Man about 11 miles from thence, we 
then went to Nathan Cornstalk ’s, 5 miles sat with 
his family, his Wife a Member; thence to Abraham 
Lapham’s 2 miles had a refreshing Oppertunity 
with his family Lodged there, 7 miles 4 day 25 checkPlace attended the Meeting at Herringdan’s 
9 miles tho it was not a time of reigning, yet an
 instructive Opportunity, Dined with the fami-
-ly where the meeting was held, Lodged at Jeremiah 
Smiths over Mud Creek, his Wife a Member
 he was one of the first settlers in these parts, 
his Cabin remains Covered with bark, the 
logs of his house are Chunked but not plastered 
I we had pretty good Beds, otherwise I thought 
the Openness of the House was a prepa-
-ration to our Lying in the woods, which we 
expect shortly to encounter the Land in these parts 
mostly flat, a deep rich soil, so that the roads 
are mostly wet and heavy, the chief body of 
the Timber is Poplar, some of them the 
finest I ever saw, Ash, Beech, and Sugar Maple 
9 miles 5th day the 26 checkPlace attended an appointed Meeting 
at Nathan Cornstalks , 2miles, it was a Solid 
favoured Opportunity, at the Close of which 
we desired that those in religious pro-
-fession with and those who had their
 minds turned towards friends would 
keep their seats, to whom Council and
 instruction was administered, the num
-bers who staid was not perhaps 40, one 
half of whom were not in membership 
but divers of them appeared a ten
-der seeking people, went in the 
Evening to Jacob Smith’s on Mud Creek 
6 miles here we had a religious Op-
-portunity with his and his Brother 
Joseph Smith ’s family this Closed our 
religious services in these parts 6th day 27 checkPlace set of for Niagara, fed at Thayers
 16 miles got to the River 8 miles here we
 expected to have been supplyed with Oates
 to take carry us to Buffaloe 80 miles but could neither get Corn or Oates, we 
then went back about one mile and 
with difficulty got one corn, we had 
 intended to have stayed all night 
at the River, but finding there was a house 
8 miles on our way & at that it was at least 
80 miles to buffalow Creek, we thought best 
to try to get there, but the Prospect was very 
discouraging, as it was like to be a dark 
Rainy Evening and the sun not above an 
hour high when we got over the river, 
yet we set off and their proving several
 Roads in the Course of 2 miles we took 
a wrong one and after 2 miles traveling 
upon enquiry found we were wrong, and then had 7 miles
 to our intended Quarters point a good house 
was a little to the left but upon trying 
could not get Quarters there, it was now near 
dusk, a dark Rainy evening and 7 miles 
of a small path in a unknown Woods 
to traverse, we had a little Moon in our favour 
yet in about 5 miles it grew so 
dark that we frequently missed our path 
and we had but little prospect of getting 
to our port, the thoughts of having to 
get by the side of a tree and hold our 
horses in the rain without fire until 
day Break was trying, yet through mer-
-cy we got safe in to our Quarters but there was 
neither hay nor father fore fodder for our 
 horses we let them out to pick a little grass while 
then tyed them up till Morning, the hay 
afforded no provision for ourselves, 
the Land from Job Howlings around throu[gh] 
the the settlement of friends is deep, Rich, 
black Soil, mostly pretty level, inclinable 
to be wet, the Surfice of the ground very 
uneven, by trees being blown up from 
time immemorial, the timber pretty 
Large and very thick, chiefly Poplar, Ash, 
Sugar Maple, Elm, Shelbark Hickory and 
some White Oak, from Jacob Smith s to the 
River about 2 or 3 miles in our first seting 
off excepted, mostly matly on open Country 
very little timber either great or small, 
the Land for the most part a sandy loam, an[d] 
the Country pretty thick settled 7th day 28th checkPlace to up very early and set off as soon
 as we could see the path, in hopes of a pretty 
pleasant day, the sun made its appearance 
about 9 or 10 yet it presently hid its face and the 
Clouds grew thick so that and the Close wood we 
were in was looked like evening, & presently the snow
 >it began to snow fall, and in a few hours the 
Limbs, and young timber became so Loaded 
 >so that it was difficult getting along, over 
the Woods continuing remarkably thick
 of under stuff, and abundances of wind fall Timber that it was a trying day 
to ride, for near 20 miles of our road was 
through a Beech and Sugar Maple Land, which 
is mostly deep rich soil, and wet, much 
of the way was very swampy, so that be-
-tween the snow and the Mud, we were 
in a wet dirty condition, and the pros-
-pect of siting down when Night came, upon 
the Snow without Shelter looked very try-
-ing, yet we went on pretty Chearful, tak-
-ing a bit of Victuals in our hands wet 
and could as we were, while our horses 
eat their Corn out of pieces of Bark 
that Lay in places by our path, when 
Evening came we espyed a Large Rock,
 near the Road, which projected 6 or 7 
feet over at one side and the Back part
 sufficiently secured from the Storm, 
have upon viewing it we concluded to take
 up our Quarters some of us went to gather-
-ing Wood, which was wet and Snowy, but
 to our great disappointment, after we 
had got our time so forward of the blaize
 through an accident by an accident it was 
 it scattered went out, and having but little for 
punk we were not able to renew it. 
here we were in the midst of a desso-
-late Wilderness, wet and could, without 
fire, without Shelter or Beding, more 
than what a Rock afforded, yet we com-
-forted our selves in being so happy as to find 
so good a Shelter, we felt as much for our 
Horses, as for ourselves, the Woods afford
-ed but little provision, and that was cover-
-ed with Snow, so that after giving them
 some Corn, we tyed them up till Morning 
and Changing some of our Wet Clothes, we 
endeavoured to take some rest, and 
tho it was Cold, we Lodged more com-
-fortable than could be expected, slept 
pretty well, took little or no cold, and 
set our Journey chearfully next Morn-
-ing 36 miles 1st day 29, checkPlace it snowed a little all night, and
 continued this Morning yet by 8 or 9 
O Clock the Sun, to our great Joy, made 
its appearance, and our road for the 
most part good, we pursued our Journey 
 with Livelyness and by 3 O Clock arived 
at Buffaloe Creek in full view of Lake
 Erie 36 Miles.—--- after we Crossed the 
Genesee River the first 10 miles, mostly an
 open plain, the timber for the next 8 or 10 
miles increased, it being pretty much 
Oak, Shelbark Hickory, some beech, and 
Sugar Maple, the next 20 or more miles
 a Very thick Wood mostly Beech, and 
Sugar Maple with some Beautiful White
 Oaks, and Poplars, from thence to the 
Lake is in the general an open Country 
for 15 or more miles very little timber 
either great or small, the Cuntry is ve-
-ry level the whole 80 miles a few hills 
excepted about some waters Creeks, there 
being 4 or 5 Creeks in this last 80 m
 nearly as large as Brandy wine, the 
fording place of some of them was 
one entire smothe Rock nearly as 
level as an house floor, so that the water 
did not vary in depth more than 2 or 3 Inches 
for side to side and fell within two yards †

went 100 or more Pearches down the Buf
-faloe, a beautiful stream to its Confluence
 with the Lake which Lake afforded had a Majestick 
appearance, the breakers roling on the 
Shore like those that More of the Atlantick. 
we rode down the Beach 3 or 4 miles 
to the Narrows of the Niagara, there 
were was neither Boat nor House on the 
Side we were, but by waiting an hour 
or more, the Boat came, which took 
three of us, and by ten we all got safe 
over, it is a bold rapid stream half 
a Mile over were we Crossed, & about 16 feet deep and it appeared dangerous and we 
were informed that a few hours of 
high Westerly Winds would blow the 
the Water off the Lake so to the end 
where the River essued, that 
it would raise it immeadiately 4 or 6 
feet, tho not altered perceptable in its depth by Rains we rode down the shore upon
 The Canada side several Miles, a plea
-sant ride being beautifyed with the River
 on one hand and good improvements on 
the other, and in some 3 or 4 miles we left
 this delightful Prospect to encounter a mis-
-erable swampy road, with some firm
 stony Land, and in 8 or 10 miles arrived 
at Asa Schuylies one of our friends which 
was truly satisfactory to us all, being 
weary, dirty, and wanted recruitive

 went in the afternoon up the Northwest 
side of Lake Erie to Obediah Denniss ’s 
who lay very low, him he and his Wife are 
members of Kingwood Monthly Meeting 
with their five Children who are under
 15, we had a beautiful ride about four 
Miles on the Beech up the Side of the Lake, the 
Sand near the Water is very Hard and 
Smoothe and is an excallent road, and what to me appeared very 
curious was the ellevations that were
 frequent along the side of the Lake, some 
of them 40 or 50 feet high 10 or more pearch
-es broad covered with Timber, and yet 
we were informed they were perfect sand 
hills blown out of the Lake, which upon 
inspection appeared to be realy the case

Ride was delightful, having the beau

and checkquered on our Left with 
pretty good improvements dwellings, in about 
12 miles we crossed a Large Stream called 
Chippaway a number of good improv-
-ments are planted near its mouth, a 
little below the mouth of this Water the 
River begins to hasten its pace, and 
in about 1 mile it became considerably 
Rapid, the road kept nearly on a level 
but the bed of the River gradually 
decended until it became very Roman
-tick so that I have no words to ex-
-press its grand, and Majestick appear
-ance, its boldness, its rapidity, its 
dashing, and flying appearance, so that
 Its dashing that it appeared looked was all in a 
foam flying in places twenty or more 
feet high, looking as as white as a sheet 
and all this, and ten times as much 
more before we came to the grand 
and perpendicular falls Catarack, the day be-
-ing very Smoky, and a little rainy we 
had not so full a view of the great falls

We then went to the River Niagara >½ a mile

this Morning, Dined at Jeremiah

 conducted Meeting, and Gospell Truths 
delivered with good Authority, the 
meeting was held chiefly for those of other so-
-cieties Lodged at Willam Lundyes 4 m 6th day the 9th [sic] checkPlace a Cold Frosty night, cloudy mor 
morning and like for now, set off for Black 
Creek, stoped to View the great falls, the wind 
Southeast blew the fog or mist that arose from 
the fall of the water over us which fell in small
 Rain so that it made it very unpleasant 
and the bank, or hill down to the Table 
Rock where we intended to have decended 
was so Sleeted over with Ice that which proceeded that was produced 
from the damp of the falls that it appear
-ed unsafe to go down, we had a pretty 
fair prospect where we stood, being per-
-haps 50 feet above the water higher than where the great 
pitch of the falls decended, it is hard 
to discribe the appearance and motion 
of the water it came down with great 
rapidity to where it projected off, tho 
 we were informed that the sheet
 was not the same thickness but appeared 
in places was 16 feet thick 
in places to be 16 or more feet, I could 
>not see the place bottom of the sheet by reason 
of the fog or mist that arose from the great fall of water, the we were informed that 
one part of the pitch was within six is 4 or 5 pearches
 feet father up the stream than it was 
nine years ago and appears to be 
gradually wearing, stoped at the Widow 
Birchels who has an extraordinary Mer-
-chant and Saw Mill on the rapids about 
80 pearches above the great falls, the 
race is 80 pearches long taken out of the 
 great River, and has in that distance 
ten feet Head and Fall, it is truly an
 awful sight to View the River from the 
Mill door, now Leaving this Wonderfull
 Phinonamy Phinonima, we had a cold 
ride up the River, and got to Asa School 
Schoolies where we Lodged 21 miles— we have now Visited all the families, 
or nearly so, of friends or such as once 
had a right, had four Meetings amongst 
them, feel easy to set our Faces homeward 
but how we shall get along must be left 
as it has been tret threttening all day 
for snow, and this evening it is fall-
-ing very fast we found residing at Black Creek pretty 
compact, tho two families were about 4 or 5 
miles from the rest, 7 families, who were in 
Membership with friends, and appeared 
pretty orderly, with a number of hopeful 
Children divers nearly or fully grown up 
making the Whole 33 persons, and 
five families who profess with friends 
 and are pretty hopefull, some of whom 
have sent acknowledgments by us to the
 Meeting that disowned them, they have a 
number of tender Inocent Children, the
 whole number of both Parents and Child-
-ren are thirty eight many of them if 
they keep their places will add strength 
to the little handful of friends in that place, 
we found at the Short Hills and in that 
neighbourhood five families of Friends 
who live at present pretty wide per-
haps 12 or more miles tho some of them have it in prospect to move nearer together for the Benefit of society, making in the whole 
twenty seven persons, and eight fami-
-lies of such who have mostly been dis-
-owned, several of whom are desirous 
to Condemn their outgoings, and have 
sent acknowledgments along with us, 
and I hope will make useful members. 
The Parents and Children of this Class 
make 53 persons and who live pretty 
compact, the way the road now goes 
makes it near 40 miles from the short 
Hills to the settlements of friends at 
Black Creek, but there is reason
 to expect that before long there will 
be a road opened between these places 
not which will containing be more than 14 or 15 
miles 7th of the week 11th a rainy Morning not 
more Snow fell last night than about 
two inches deep, wrote a number of 
Letters to some friends in this neighbour-
-hood, and feeling our minds easy to 
return, we made preparations to pass 
homewards, the had not the season been 
so far advanced we would have been 
easy to have stayed a few days longer, 
about 11 OClock we left our tender friends 
at Black Creek with Hearts full of 
Gratitude that we had been amongst 
them, and some of them bore us Compa-
-ny as far as the River, where we ar-
-rived about ½ after two OClock, havin[g] 
rode about 8 miles down the Beech
 on lake Erie, we were ise in num-
-ber, and the Wind blowing high and
 the River Rough, we were Obliged 
to go two at a time, which took 
near three hours to get over, and 
it Raining hard made it disagree-
-able, and we were truly thankful 
when we got safe on our own shore Lodged 
at Buffoaloe 15 miles 1st day of the Week 12th, we lay last Evening
 next the Roof, and their falling much 
Rain, it was so plainly heard, that the
 difficulty of passing through the Genesee 
where there are a number of large
 Creeks, without bridges, and no house to 
stop at provided we could not Cross,
 presented with all its discouragements, 
which led into an enquiry whether we 
had too much hurried out of Can ada 
and upon the most strict enquiry exa-
-mination, nothing remained painful 
as an Omission, but it would have been 
more easy to most of our Minds 
 if we had stayed over first day, feering 
our leaving them 7th day and next day this little meeting coming on 
least it should administer some discou-
-ragement to the few friends there
 however resignation was our best expe-
-dient, and when Morning came, the 
rain still continuing very heavy, we 
can thought it most safe, and felt most 
easy to remain in our Quarters, about 
noon the rain abated, the wet a little till
 evening 2nd day the 13 checkPlace rose early this morning to pur-
-sue our Journey, still Cloudy, from the best 
 information we could get, were in hopes 
the Waters, except Tawnywanty, would be 
fordable, but in about four Miles travel-
-ing we were disappointed, for we came 
upon a very rapid Stream, which upon
 examining, we believed not safe to Cross 
and to 18 hours since the rain abated
 it appeared still to be rater rising, this 
was a fresh trial, but patience was our 
best expedient, for if we had ventured 
and got safe over this stream, there was ano- 
 another much larger 6 or 7 miles ahead 
we therefore, upon holding a Council, agreed as 
the most safe expedient to return to our 
 Quarters, and wait until tomorrow 
Our Landlords house stands on a pleasant 
elevated spot having a rich, furtile Meadow 
in front, enlivened by the Buffaloe to its Con-
-fluence with Lake Erie, the stream is perhaps 
as Large>r than of Brandywine, and the Lake its
self opens in full view as far as the Eye can reach, when 
the Wind is high in the West, it so raises 
the Water in this end of the Lake, that it 
flows up the Buffaloe like a flood tide 
our accomodation here has been pretty 
good, except our Lodging, which was a 
narrow frame scarely room for two to 
lay on their Back, with Boards instead of 
Sackingbottom with and a very thin Strawbed 
yet Oliver Paxton and myself has Occupy-
-ed it three nights pretty comfortably and 
expect to try it the fourth, it is in an 
upper Chambers next the Roof 3rd day 14, checkPlace a blustry night, but pretty pleasant
 Morning, all in health, and wit an early 
start set off cheerfully homewards, came 
to the water that turned us back Yesterday 
the very rapid Crossed pretty readily, here 
Lay a poor family in distress, they came 
from Bucks County and were going into 
Canada, Rain, and high waters had 
detained them several days in this 
Wilderness, their Journey had been tedi-
-ous and their Money spent, and what
 was more trying their provision was 
run out, and no place to supply it un-
-til they got through, they were encamped 
by the side of the rapid stream that we 
had Just Crossed, we endeavoured to Com
fort them, leting them know they were 
nearly through, where there was provi-
-sion to be had, and for an immediate 
relief spared them a small Loaf of Bread, 
and gave the Children some piece pieces 
of Cake, and for their further relief supply gave 
them two Dollars, our sympathy and kind-
-ness very much Affected the Poor Woman 
and we parted with her in bathed in 
 Tears, feeling thankful that we had 
it in our Power thus far to admini-
-ster relief, we cheerfully proceeded on 
our Journey, hoping the large Creek 
ahead would be fordable, but on our 
arrival our hopes appeared frustrat
-ed, for it was very high and appeard 
still to be rising, and it was too wide 
to make a Bridge aCross by falling a Tree, 
we explored the stream up 
and down but discovered no place 
more eligiable than the common 
fording, and there, tho not much 
above belly deep, we believed not 
safe to pass, by reason of its great 
rapidity, and some 20 or 30 pearches 
below a mightily mightiy fall of perhaps 50 or 
60 feet, to sit down by it to wait for 
the Water to fall, was trying, as and their 
was no house nigher than 12 miles 
and we had but Just Provision with 
 us, to carry, without detention, ourselves 
and horses to the Genesee River, and to 
turn back 12 miles felt unpleasant, how
-ever, thought best to stay till towards 
evening to see if their would be any 
change in the Water, and in about 
3 or 4 hours there came up a Company 
of Men who had been out a surveying 
they had a number of axes with them 
and we went down the streem about 
half a Mile, where it was divided into 
four branches streams having small Islands 
between, and here, tho they water ran surpris
-ingly swift, and the bottom unknown 
yet we thought best to try to get over 
the Men with Axes fell Trees across 
which would reach at these from Island to Islands
 and explored the banks and Depth 
of the Streams at the Opposite side, we
 attempted and through mercy got all 
safe over, for which favour we felt
 humblingly thankful, we then tra
veled on, making no less a band than
 19 in number and in 10 miles pitch
-ed our Camps on the West east side of a 
lively brook, where we could regale 
ourselves with water and our bags 
supplyed us with Provisions, we 
fortunate fortunately in this spot 
found a pretty comfortably Indian 
Wigwam, being covered with bark 
on the top and three sides, the front 
being open, here we erected a very 
hospitable Fire, and with thankful
 Hearts for so good a retreat, enjoyed
 a Comfortable Nights repose, and 
tho in the Wilderness yet we had 
our Neighbours, their being no 
less than four Fires within 40 pear 
pearches distance to >two of which were 
surrounded by Indians who were on their way to Fort Erie, the 
Night was clear and Cold, and we 
hoped we should be favoured with
 dry Weather till we got into the set-
-tlement 22 miles 4th day the 15 checkPlace a cold frosty morning and 
 a little Cloudy, set of very early and 
in 5 or 6 miles we had a smart snow
 shower, and shortly after another the 
wind at North and very Cold, the
 Tonewanty we were informed by an 
Indian, was by far too deep to be rid
 we then thought best to go be the 
Indian Village which stood on the 
 EastWestside of said stream, and was 
 perhaps 4 miles morefurther, we were in 
 -formed there waswereabout 150 Indians 
 in said Village, the have but a few houses 
for that number, there were two hew-
 -ed log houses pretty neat an tight 
& perhaps 40 or50 feet long, andthey were 
 stowed full, with several other small 
huts near by, after some small refresh-
 -ment at a dirty Frenchmans house
 on the bank of the said river, we proceeded
 to Cross, he having a small Canoe
 took us over one by one with our bug
gage baggage, and Cold as it was 
we swam our horses through, and in 
about 16 miles traveling we came 
to an Indian Wigwam, not so good 
as we met with last night, yet, tho 
we had an hour of Son, we thought
it best >of to tak>ing up our Quarters, we here 
having had a frozen frozen day to 
ride and likely to be a very cold snow 
snowy night, time was necessary to 
provide with wood &c: which we got 
Compleated and ready to set down 
before to a Comfortable refreshing
 fire, before dark, here we passed 
a very Cold night, as chearfull and pleasant,
 as could be expected, feel
-ing more for our horses, than our

but Snow and Leaves, we therefore 
both last night, and this, after giv-
-ing them some Oates tyed them up 
 till Morning 5th day the 16, checkPlace a Cloudy Frozen Morning 
tho but little snow fell Last night 
we found the Frost added to the dif-
-ficulty of traveling about 25 or more miles of 
the road between buffaloe and the 
Genesee is through a succession of 
deep swamps, and this morning 
our our first sitting of[f] we had one several of 
those difficulties to encounter this be-

knee deep, and being Froze over 
almost hard enough to bear, 
it was exceeding exceed difficult and tryin[g]

There to the Genesee 12 miles Lodged 
at Foxes near by, here we got good 
entertainment accommodations for 
Man and horse which was very gr
ful after so trying a Journey. the Country from Buffaloe to Genesee 
I discribe as of follows from Buffaloe

heavy timbered, to Stony Creek 8 miles 
 mostly plains, thence to a small stre

the first time since we left Munsy 
thence to Danville 17 miles over a very 
Beautiful rich country we thought 
much of it superior to any we passed 
over and very Curiously situated hav

we met with very good accommodations 7th day the 18 checkPlace a Cold frozen Morning 
but we were Cleaned with a Clear 
sun the most of the day, which we 
esteemed a favour, having but few 
such days for near three Weeks, there 
are two Roads from this place to
 Bath, one flat, much of the way down the 
Waters of the Cohocton tho and is very 
deep and Miry, and scarcly at this 
time passable, the other called the 
Mountain Road, and was rightly 
denominated, we thought it would 
be better to encounter the Mountains 
than the Mud, but truly such a Road 
I never rid, it was about 15 miles 
we had to encounter this Wild and
 romantick sen scene which with all 
the Industry we could use cost us six 
hours hard Traveling, the whole 
way was one continued Mountains 
one after another, perhaps half or more 
of a Mile up, and almost immedi-
-ately as far down, generally so steep 
 that it was with the greatest dif-
-ficulty our horses kept their feet 
and I found myself frequently un-
-der the necessity of taking hold of 
my horses tail to help me up, ma-
-ny of these Mountains where so load-
-ed with spruce and hemlock that 
at noon day, tho a bright sun and 
the ground covered with snow, it 
looked like twilight to look up the 
North side of them, and in many 
places there were such a number 
of tress blown across the path 
that it was with the greatest diffi-
-culty we got round or over some 
of them, and in some other places tho high 
up on the mountains, we were
 nearly to the horses bellies in Mud and Ice 
and for 18 miles in this Wild roman-
-tick scene not so much as one Cabin 
was to be found, nor I suppose ever will tho it abounded with 
Deer, Bear, and Wolf Tracks, with other Wild Beasts we got 
to Bath with great industry in the
 dusk of the Evening weary, 
Could, and hungry, but lighting at 
the foremost Tavern, could get 
no hay for our Horses, which upon 
enquiry was the situation of the 
other Public Houses, in town tho the Capital of Subend County we therefore

our Quarters, but they had no Oates, 
very little corn, and but poor hay, 
we therefore proceeded 5 miles 
further up the Tyoga to Salsbury’s 
tho but poor accommodations, yet 
they were very kind, in this days travel 
we have seen 4 deer near 
by and a Multitude of their tracks 
 we have Crossed four Large Streams 
of the Susquehanna in 14 miles each of them
 we Judged as large again as Bran-
-dywine they were all of them more 
than Belly deep, and we felt truly 
thankful Considering the great 
fall of Rain that we are safely 
over them 29 miles --- here we met with two travelers 
that who had Just come from the Block-
-house, they informed us the Road 
there was so bad that it cost them two 
days >hard traveling, which and that we 
could not reach there it in one day tho 
but 35 miles, this information was ve-
-ry discouraging, for their was no stage 
or house short of 23 miles of sd. Blockhouse yet upon 
considering the circumstances we 
concluded to make a trial of going 
through in one day, and if we failed 
to lye in the Woods, Cold and Snowy as 
it was 2nd day the 20 checkPlace Started Just as day ap-
-peared, a Cold frozen Morning.
We wanted a loaf of bread to make 
use of provided not knowing but we should 
have to lie on the Woods, were desirous to be provided with some bread we tried our 
Landlord, and nearly every house 
we came by for ten Miles, but 
they unanimously informed us 
they had no Bread baked, by them, 
we Stoped at Lambs 10 miles the Last house 
but one, in that settlement fed our horses and got our
 Breakfast, and then with Industry 
reached the Blockhouse by sunset 
our living of Late has been poor, both 
for ourselves and horses, this is the 
second night out of four that they 
have had to do without hay, and we have 
had no wheat or Indian Bread for tw[o] 
days, and when often to drink our 
Tea Without Sugar, we could get no
 milk this Evening, not so much 
as to put a Little in our Coffee, nei- 
 -ther had we butter to eat with our 
Buckwheat Cake, and our Vaneson was fryed without fat, and Last Evening 
there was nothing on the Table but mu 
Mush and Milk, this has been a trying 
day to our horses, as I mentioned the 
Morning was Cold and Frozen, and 
our Road led up by the side of Ty-
-ago River, and which we had it to Cross ed 
eleven times to day and once yes-
-terday, in 25 miles frequently Belly deep and 
sometimes deeper More in 25 miles and where 
we crossed last it last, it was nearly as large as 
Bandywine, I had like to have forgot to note 
that after we had fed the second time 
which was at petersons camp 15 miles, from the last stage 
where there is no house, having to cleaning the snow 
of the Grass to give our horses their Oates 
which was trying to us thus to wait in as our Cold a Con-
-dition as we were in, to be thus in the Snow 
and pertake of our little Morsall, I say 
a few miles after this, when we were ente-
-ring on our discouraging road, we 
met a poor distressed family, being 
a Man and his Wife, and five small 
Children, two of whom rode with the Mother 
 one with the Father on a large pack 
of something, and who by themselves, 
some of them were without Stockings Cold as 
it was, to see that those in their distressed, 
much helpless, and Cumbred condition, 
had surmounted all the difficulties 
as to badness of Road, &c that were before 
us, we felt our hearts animated, to pursue our Journey and I 
thought we had no cause in our well 
provided state condition to entertain the least
 discouragement, the family above noted 
had lain in the Woods last night without
 any Camp, the Ground five Inches deep 
with snow, and the weather so Cold that
 abundance of Ice was floating on the 
Waters we had lately Crossed, and they would 
have to encounter the same trials this 
Night as they could reach no house. 3rd day the 21 checkPlace set off as soon this Morning 
as was safe, in hopes we should be able 
to reach a friends House this Evening, 
which was very desirable, the Morning 
was Cloudy and very Cold, and we had a 
rough high Country for 10 miles to travel
 over, on which there were three two remarkable 
eminences the first was so thickly enclosed 
with Hemlock that it afforded very little
 Prospect, beneath our feet, tho through some openings the top of the mountains around appeared the other was Just as you we be-
-gan to defend from off the Lawrel Hill. 
This Prospect was truly grand, we appeared 
to be above the tops of the Allegenies, which 
rose up in a very romantick and wild 
appearance, the View was very extensive 
and these ellevations being white with snow appeared to be almost 
without Timber, so that with the help of fan-
-cy they looked like improved Farms, hav-
-ing many places the appearance of square 
Fields, with hedge rows, and divisions, but 
I have no expectation that these inhospital
 regions will ever be a the habitation of man for any
thing but for the Wild Beasts of the Forest and the 
Fowls of the Air, fed at the foot of the Laurel 
 hill 9 miles in the snow, there being no house, here our 
Road led us down a beautiful Branch of the 
Lycoming tho very much choaked with 
drift wood, some of our company had the 
curiosity to count how many times we 
crossed it in eight miles, where it united 
with the main branch, and the made it about 
28 times, and the Lycoming itself we Crossed
 perhaps ten times more, these waters make 
a brake through what is called the Allegenies 
and the vale in many places, particularly be-
fore we come to the main stream, is not more 
than 8 or 10 pearches Wide and the Mountains 
rise on each hand remarkably high & steep 
so that our traveling was almost litterally
 sneaking under the Hills and Mountains, fed at 
Kyle’s 10 miles here we got our dinner, hav-
-ing Bear Meat and Veneson fryed up to
gether, Tea without sugar, with good Wheat 
Bread & Butter, in nine Miles from hence 
we finally left the Lycoming a beautiful 
Stream, we thought about as large as two 
of Brandywine, and in six Miles we 
Crossed the Loyalsock a lovely stream, per-
-haps nearly as large as two of Lycomon 
and got to Samual Wallice’s , weary, where 
we were kindly, and Hospitablybelly enter-
-tained, and the Contrast was very great 
was very great between our entertain-
ment here and what we have latterly 
met with, our Beds ever since we came 
from Asa Schoolies in Canada, have been 
a small proportion of straw mostly on 
 of straw, except Boards instead of socking 
Bottom, except when we lay in the Woods on 
Bark, they mostly appeared dirty, uniformly 
without any sheet over us, but in lieu thereof 
a Rough Course Blanket, our meal has been 
steadily fryed Veneson sometimes pretty good, 
our Bread for 100 miles, with some small 
exceptions, has been indifferent Buckwhea[t] 
cakes, our drink almost ever since we 
left home has been water, Bohea Tea is 
much used in Canada, which they drink 
very strong, with or without Sugar, as their 
store holds out, they have a great Plenty of 
Sugar Maple, of which some of the Inhabi-
-tants make a sufficiency for themselves 
but we found a number of them out, not
withstanding this was their situation, they 
could lay the Teatable for their friends, & 
sit down with as much composure as 
if all were compleat, which I counted 
a piece of Philosophy worth Labouring after 4th day the 22 checkPlace a Northeast Wind, and a 
Cold Wet morning, our horses, and our 
selves being weary and wanted some rest 
and being among friends here upon 
 upon Conferrence we thought we should 
feel most easy to see friends in most of the 
meetings on this side the Mountains, ex
-cept Oliver Paseton , who felt his mind 
bound to get home to their Quarterly 
Meeting, and James Langstaff , was free
 to go with him for Company, we parted 
with great nearness & heart felt Affecti-
-on, having traveled in much Brotherly 
love, united in the same cause, Brethren 
in Jeopardy, and Perils, both in the 
Wilderness and among great Waters, & 
now having got thus far safly through 
and among our friends, our hearts
 were enabled to bless the Lord for his 
manifold favours, and under a Sense
 thereof to bid each other farewell. 5th day the 23 a rainy wet day at William Ellises , where we arrived 
this Morning 3 miles 5th day the 23 a rainy, wet day, attend-
-ed Munsy Meeting, dined at William 
Ellises 2 miles, went to Fishing 
 Creek that evening, William and Wife 
bearing us company, Lodged at Jacob 
Cleytons 16 miles 6th 23 [sic] a Northwest Wind and pretty 
clear, Went to Fishing Creek Meeting
 2 ½ Miles, which was a comforting 
refreshing Opportunity, and my soul 
was enabled to Worship in secret 
dined at John Eveses near the Meeting 
house, and with industry got to Cate-
-wissee that Evening, having the 
Susquehannah to Cross 15 mile, lod-
-ged at John Loyds where we were kindly
 entertained, his Wife companion being a neat 
house wife, both the our supper and
 Bed evinced it 7 day the 24 [sic] attended the Monthly Meeting 
at Catewissee, which was a low exercising 
time in the forepart, but life gradually 
rose under the Ministry of J.L. till I 
thought I had ever seldom experienced the like, 
it was a memorable time, and ended 
well, and the Business of the Monthly 
 Meeting was transacted in a good degree 
of right order, there are a large num-
-ber of pretty exemplary concerned 
friends belonging to this Meeting, I
 believe there is no monthly Meeting 
within the compass of our yearly Meet
-ing that takes in so large a scope of 
Country as this, and the members 
are still spreading wider, we 
were informed there are upwards 
of one hundred and Eighty families 
within its Compass, and I fully be-
-lieve it will be right, and will conduce 
to the promotion cause of Truth and righte-
-ousness for a division of the Month-
-ly Meeting to take place before long, also 
for a preparative meeting to be established at 
Fishing Creek, dined at John Loyd ’s
 and lodged at Charles Chapman s 
2 miles 1st day the 26 a clear day and northWest 
Wind, we had the Opportunity of 
seeing three Wild Deer, out of the 
friends Poarch where we lodged, they 
 passed very Quietly along, we also 
saw another large Buck coming up the 
road toward us, as we were riding to 
roring Creek Meeting, which we at-
-tended, 4 miles it was large, and I hope pro-
-fitable dined at Nathan Lee s near the 
Meeting house, and Lodged at Bezelleel
 Hayherst 4miles he lives on the edge of 
what is called the little Mountain, his 
House is the last we came to in Roring 
Creek Settlement 2nd day the 27 checkPlace a Clear Cold Morning, soon after
 we set off we ascended what is called the 
little Mountain, of which to the Westward 
there is a grand, and very extensive 
prospect, we overlook all Roring
 Creek Valley, the Susquehannah down 
as low as Northumberland, and over 
the Tops of Munsy Mountains Quite 
to the Allegenies, we were fully con-
-vinced when on the top of this Moun
-tain that we were in a Colder Re-
-gion, than when on the Plains, for 
 when we left Wiliam Ellises we pre-
-sently assended the Munsy Mountain 
it was a Cold Northeast rain, but not 
in the least Froze on the Trees until 
we began to asscend this eminence 
where the trees became more or less 
Cloathed with Ice, and when we got 
to its highest eminence sumit the young 
Pines were as loaded that many 
of their Tops were bent to the gro 
ground, and when we desended into 
the Valley the Ice on the Limbs was 
not to be seen, but when we got 
on the Top of this Mountain, which 
was two days after, and both clear, 
yet the twigs of the Trees were still 
much covered with sleet, and the
 snow much more deeper than in the Vales 
we got to Michal Masyers that even
-ing 34 miles, he keeps pretty good accom-
-modations, and the Cheapest by near one 
half of any that we met with, 3rd day the 28 checkPlace a Clear Cold Morning 
Schulkill nearly Covered with floating 
Ice, went to Mordica Lees to Break-
-fast 15 miles were we were kindly 
hospitabelly entertained Lodged here 
15 miles 4th day the 29 checkPlace attended the Monthly of 
Maiden Creek which was a time of refresh-
-ment to my Mind, lodged at Pennose Wily’s 
1 ½ miles. 5th day the 30 checkPlace set off early this Morning 
homewards, a Clear Cold day, stoped to 
see Francis Parvin who was very unwell 
when we came to Schulkill it looked very 
trying to ride it, by reason of its depth, and of the great
 Quantity of Floating Ice that which covered the 
surfice of the Stream and the depth of 
the water , we waited near half an hour 
from the Boat, but the Ferryman after 
considerable exertion failed geting 
the boat it over by reason of the ice so that we had at last to encoun-
-ter the Frozen rugged stream, and through 
mercy got safe >through my mind was 
 was much comforted, as I Rode home-
-wards this day, with Heavenly consolation good
ness, and on looking over our Jour-
-ney, felt thankful that I had given 
up to the Service, and on >now returning felt feeling 
the sweet reward of Peace therefore fufil bow-
-ed my Mind into Contrition, and filled it with true
 thankfulness for the present favour. 
got to Isaac Coates a little within 
Evening where we were received 
with Open hearts 18 miles. 12mo 1st checkPlace after a tendering opportu-
-nity this morning, wherein we had 
to experience Ancient goodness 
 near and to acknowledge that we had 
been helped through many difficul-
-ties and so far brought safely
 back, had been made near and 
dear to each other, under a fresh 
and renewed sense of so great a 
sorrow we bid each other farewell
 and set of to our several habitations 
where I arrived in the afternoon & 
was Lovingly received by my Dear 
Wife and Children whom I found 
enjoying a good state of health, for 
which favour, and my own preser-
-vation while out, I feel truly thank-
-ful, having been from home Just 
Seven Weeks, and traveled by com-
-putation near one thousand miles. Big spring 8 Buttermilk fall 6 White Oak Plains 20 Through the Lo 5 To Tonewanty 8 To the plains 6 To Stony Creek 28 To Buffaloe 12 ---- 83 on Boards instead of Socking Bottom 
except when we lay in the Woods on bark, 
the mostly appeared dirty, uniformly with 
out any Sheet on over us, but in its place 
a rough Coarse Blanket, our meal has been 
steadily fryed Veneson, sometimes pretty good 
nor Bread for 100 or more Miles with some small 
exception has been indifferent Buckwheat 
cakes, our drink almost ever since we left 
home, Water, Bohea Tea is much used in Canada and 
which they drink very strong, they have plenty of sugar Ma-
-ple and make their own Sugar, tho in many 
places were out, that our Tea was frequently drank 
without, which was our situation in many 
places Since
