 Philadelphia, February 11th: 1792. The President of the United States commands 
 T. Lear to return the enclosed paper, which was 
 submitted to the consideration of the President last 
 evening, containing the sentiments proposed to be 
 delivered, in writing, by the Quakers to the deputation 
 from the Cherokee nation of Indians now in this 
 City and to inform, that the President, upon 
 a due consideration of the subject; does not see any 
 impropriety in the enclosed speech being delivered 
 to the Cherokees, as it contains the same friendly 
 sentiments with which he has himself endeavoured 
 to impress these people and doesn't appear to be 
 a matter that can be drawn into precedent on any 
 future occasion. Neither has the President any 
 objection to those Indians being furnished by the 
 Quakers with such small presents as were men- 
 tioned to him last evening. Tobias Lear

 of the United States
