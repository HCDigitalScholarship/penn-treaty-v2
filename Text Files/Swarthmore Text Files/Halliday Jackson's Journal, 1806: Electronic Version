 Some Account of a Visit pa
 to the Friends at Tunesassa & the
 Indians liveing on Allegany & Cata-
 raugus Rivers, agreably to an appoint-
 ment of the Committee on Indian
 Affairs in the 8th Month 1806-- I left home on Seconday the first of the 
 ninth month, & pursuant to agreement
 met with John Philips , & Isaac Bonsal 
 who were to be my Companions on the inten-
 ded embassy, & Nicholas Waln Jr also pro-
 pos'd accompanying us for the benefit of
 his health. -- On the 2nd we set out
 from Isaac Bonsals and traveling by way of
 Maidencreek, Catawessy, Muncy, Williams-
 port and Morris's Settlement on pine Creek
 we reached Francis Kings on the Oswega
 in the afternoon of the 10th all in good
 health, having had pleasant weather for
 traveling the night previous
 lay on our Blankets 
 in the woods near one of the head springs
 of the Alligany River -- This Morning was very Cool for the Time
 of year and a large white frost which nearly
 destroy'd the Buckwheat in that settlement
 and injur'd the Corn very much--Agreably
 to an appointment of Isaac Bonsals , today 
 at ten Oclock a Meeting was held with the
 few Settlers in this place. Mary Bell , with
 her Children attended and several others to
 the amount of near twenty in number, &
 I.B. had good Counsel to communicate-- After dineing with F.K. we rode to Major
 Hoopes's settlement at the mouth of Issue on
 Allegany River, 12 Miles. and was entertain'd
 in a friendly and hospitable manner--
 This evening two Indians with whom I
 was acquainted arived here from thier settle-
 ment at Tunessassa, on their way to Genesee
 They also know me, seem'd glad to see us,
 said our friends at Tunesassa were well and 
 would look for us in a day 
 This morning was 
 early and rideing down the Allegany River
 arivd at the upper Settlements of Indians
 near the Mouth of the Little Valley about
 one Oclock. We stopt at Peter Sniders to
 feed our horses and take some refreshment
 ourselves & a number of Indians collected
 about us, most of them knew one & seem'd
 much pleas'd with our comeing-- This was about 12 Miles Above Tunesassa,
 and as we past down the River we found
 a good road open'd by the Indians most of the 
 way saw a large number of Cornfields,
 many new Settlements made, and several
 small villages built since I left
 them six years before-- Many of the Indians
 came to shake hands with us as we rode along
 expressing their Joy to see us, in their usual way
 of exultation-- We ariv'd at Tunesassa
 a little before sunset, found our friends Jacob
 Taylor, Joel Swayne , Benjamin Cope his wife
 Rachel , & Hannah Jackson all well, much
 pleas'd to see us and gratifyed with hearing
 from their Relations and friends and receiving 
 a large number of acceptable letters---
 according to computation I made the distance
 in all my Route thus far about 308 Miles -
 and after a long Wilderness Journey over many
 rough Mountains, Bad roads, and in some
 places but poor accommodations, the compa-
 ny of our friends this evening in a comfortable
 house was Mutually satisfactory --- 13th - Last night a very heavy rain fell with
 much lightening and heavy thunder--this
 enabled our friends to get a good deal of Grind-
 ing done, as the water had been very low for
 some time past, by reason of a great drouth
 they have had in those parts the latter part
 of Summer -- We spent the forenoon in
 viewing the Farm, Mills and other im-
 provements and friends have made at this
 place - It appears they have got about
 54 Acres of Land Clear'd well enclos'd and in
 good Order - the Buildings thereon are very
 good - the dwelling House 22 by 36 feet is
 situated on a beautiful eminence command-
 ing a view of the whole farm and Mills - it
 is two stories high containing four rooms 
 on each floor besides Closets Pantry &c
 and a good Cellar under a part of it--a little
 distance from this they have erected a house
 18 by 22 feet for the purpose of instructing
 the Indian Women in, also a convenient
 Barn built this Summer 29 by 50 feet -- The Mills look well and are Capable
 of doing considerable business -- The Grist
 Mill upon a full head will grind 120 bushels
 of Grain pr. day reckoning from daylight
 till evening & the sawmill will cut near
 two thousand feet of boards in the same time Altho the water has been low for several
 weeks past they have mostly been able to
 grind all the Grain the Indians brought to
 the mill, and for the most part this is a very
 forcible stream, and with a little labour
 may be made Navigable from the Mill
 to the River -- Our friends had about
 400 Dozens of winter Grain the late harvest mostly
 wheat, besides a quantity of Oates &c. Their
 potatoes Turnips Garden &c looks well --
 They have about 8 Acres of Good bottom 
 in Grass, & about 21 Acres of new Ground
 clear'd this Summer to put in with winter
 Grain which they are now preparing to sow. A White Man with a family lives in ano-
 ther house on the farm, who works the saw
 Mill to the shares and all the logs the
 Indians bring to the Mill are saw'd to the
 halves, and Boards are sold to such of them
 as want to buy at half the present Market
 price -- A survey of the farm is not
 yet made, and must necessarily include
 a part of two mountains to secure the ad-
 vantage of the water, but will also include
 a large proportion of two Valleys of
 exelent land Cover'd with a great quantity
 of good pine timber, also some Whiteoak
 hemlock, Sugar Maple &c. In our walks at
 the foot of a Mountain 50 or 60 perches from
 the house we went to view a large stone
 which we thought something of a curiosity
 it was about 24 feet in circumference
 about 18 inches elevated above ground, the
 top of it nearly horizontal and twelve 
 hollows work'd out thereon about the
 size of a large disk, which appear'd to have
 been done by the Indians in antient times
 and probably they have often made use
 of them for eating their victuals on -- We also visited Levi Halftown , who is setled
 adjoining our friends farm, and works at
 the Smiths business - He was at work in
 his Smithshop makeing an Oxchain, &
 we understand the other Smith who is setled
 up the River, is a very ingenius Man &
 industrious at his trade. ---- In the afternoon we all walk'd down the
 River in company with Jacob Taylor &
 Joel Swayne to view the Old farm at
 Genesinguhta & visit the few families
 that remain there -- The place look'd
 very natural to me & the Indians my
 Old neighbours, much pleas'd with my
 comeing again to see them -- The house
 I had assisted in building & liv'd in while
 there is now occupie'd by an Indian Chief
 the name of Mush , but the high fresh 
 in the River last Spring was a year had
 wash'd away a good deal of the soil, & injur'd the
 improvements very much so that most of
 the Indians has mov'd and setled higher up
 the River -- While we were here Connudia
 came to see us in order to agree upon a time
 for holding a counsel, & altho we desired a little
 time to go about, & view their improvements
 previous to meeting them in Counsel, yet as
 we understood they were going off in a few days
 to meet a General Counsel of the six Nations
 at Buffalo Creek we thought most expedient
 to fix upon Seconday next, & Connudia agreed
 to inform the Indians accordingly --- After returning to Tunesassa and haveing
 some conferrence with our friends we under-
 stood some little uneasiness had got into a
 few of the Indians minds with respect to our
 friends not lending them tools and working
 for them as much as they formerly did - we
 also understood that one or two of their
 young Chiefs had introduc'd some Liquor in
 a Clandestine manner in order to sell to
 the white people, but that the Indians in 
 general was much oppos'd to such conduct --
 it also appear'd there was some little divisions
 among the Indians with respect to their
 Chiefs that several young men had rose
 up of Considerable influence, and Cornplan-
 -ter was not esteem'd among them as a
 principal Chief & that they had very late-
 -ly been holding a general counsel among
 themselves about these matters -- After
 deliberating on these subjects and several others
 that came under consideration it appear'd
 necessary to form an address in writeing to
 lay before them at the ensuing Counsel
 and accordingly some essay was made for
 that purpose -- 14th This being Firstday we sat with our
 friends in their oppertunity of religeous
 retirement - John Bell attended & two
 Men our friends have employ'd in their
 service - It was a comfortable season &
 a renewed evidence felt that friends in
 their secluded situation was in their
 proper alottment, and at times comforted 
 with a prospect that their Labours
 among this people was under the direction
 of best wisdom and the concern own'd by him
 who hath called them to the work ---- Just before dinner Cornplanter came
 to see us and said he was glad to hear of
 our Arival. He knew me and enquir'd
 after my family - I gave several friends
 love to him who had sent it by me, among
 the rest John Parrish who he was wellpleas'd
 to hear from and enquir'd particularly whe-
 ther the Old Man was yet able to ride about -
 he din'd with us had a good deal of conversa-
 tion & said he would meet us in counsel
 tomorrow... In the afternoon most of our Company
 took a walk thro' part of the Adjacent
 woods intended to be included in the survey
 of this farm, and ascended a mountain
 on the South side of the Farm (call'd
 the South Mountain) nearly to the top
 with considerable difficulty, climbing
 over abundance of logs then overgrown
 with Briars and Bushes -- from the 
 north side of the Mountain we had
 a fair view of the farm and improvements
 thereon, also an extensive view of surrou-
 nding hills and interveneing valleys - after
 gratifying ourselves with such prospects
 as then open'd to our view we descended
 the Mountain rather more hastily than
 we went up, & found our Women friends
 had a delicious repast prepar'd for us of
 Nutmeg Cantilopes, and Watermellons -- 15th About 8 Oclock we walkt up the River
 to the new Town at the Cold Spring where
 the Counsel was propos'd to be held - After
 sounding the Trumpet several times
 the Indians Collected and about twelve Oclock
 we were invited into the Counsel room
 which is a long building prepard for that
 purpose - After being seated Connudia 
 Arose and using their Usual Ceremony
 said he was thankful to the Great Spirit
 for our preservation on our long Journey
 and that we had arived safe and found
 the Indians all well & our friends who live
 among them and that they had all liv'd in 
 in peace and friendship with them - he
 also said they were very Glad to see us
 and was now ready to hear us speak -- After returning them a little Ceremony
 of the same kind the address from the
 Committee on Indian affairs was read
 & interpreted by Henry Abeal being as follows To the Chiefs and others of the
 Seneca Nation setled on and near the
 Allegany River -- Brothers,
 Your friends the Quakers continue
 frequently to meet in counsel to think of you. Brothers,
 Our minds have been made glad
 to hear from time to time of your good
 resolutions to live soberly and to refrain
 from strong drink as likewise that you
 improve in industry and in the ma-
 nagement of your Land - we hope the
 good Spirit will enable you to keep
 your minds strong in these good resolutions Brothers,
 Let your ears be open and may
 your hearts be prepar'd to understand - 
 You have own'd that the Counsel of
 we have for several years given you
 and that the assistance of our young men
 in learning you how to cultivate your
 Land & to live comfortably, has been good
 for yourselves, your wives, and your children. Brothers,
 We now feel desirous to say some-
 thing to you on a subject of great importance
 which we wish you would seriously attend
 to and consider -- Brothers,
 You know that the people
 called Quakers are a peaceable people
 they can have no concern in wars and
 fightings, and the destruction of their fellow
 men, they desire that al men should
 live in peace and feel love for each other. Brothers,
 There are two great command-
 ments which all ranks of Christians thro-
 -out the world profess a belief in and that
 it is their duty to observe and obey them
 They are first - that we should love the
 Lord our God with all our hearts and with
 all our souls and with all our strength -- Second, and to love our neighbours as ourselves
 of these commandments had these proper effect
 in the hearts of men and the did in sincerity
 and truth love worship and adore the
 Great and good Spirit from whom all 
 blessings come it would be a happy state
 and preserve from war and Bloodshed -- Brothers,
 We desire not to fill your ears
 with words, but rather to recommend
 you to retire and gather your mind,
 into Quiet and Settlement, and thus as you
 humbly wait and have prayers and desires
 raised in your minds to be rightly instructed
 and continue inwardly attendtive you will
 be in the way of receiveing light knowledge
 and Counsel superior to any we can import,
 for there is a divine principal of light
 and grace in every heart, by it our forefa-
 -thers were taught and we their descendants
 have been taught to love all men as
 Brethren, and have been restraind from
 revengeing injuries or rendering evil for
 evil, and this has been the profession
 of your friends the Quakers for more
 than one hundred and fifty years -- Brothers,
 Influenced by desires for the wel-
 fare of you our Indian Brothers three
 of our friends have agreed to visit you
 this fall - Their names are Isaac Bonsal 
 John Philips & Halliday Jackson ---- Brothers,
 Attend these friends are
 beloved by us, and as their desires for
 your welfare are strong we hope you
 will keep your ears open to what advice
 they may give you and let it sink deep
 in your hearts. Philadelphia8 Mo. 12th 1806Sign'd John Parrish Nicholas Waln Henery Drinker Oliver Paxson John Elliott Thomas Howardson Thomas Wistor 
and a number of others After a little pause our speech which we
 had committeed to writing was then read &
 Interpreted being as follows --- To the Chiefs and Indians in general
 residing on the Allegany River-- Brothers Attend
 You have now heard
 the speech your Brothers the Quakers
 have sent with us from Philadelphia and
 we hope the advice they have given you will
 sink deep in your hears, and if any
 part of it does not feel easy that you will tell us Brothers,
 We have come a great ways to
 see you and our friends who live beside
 you, and are thankful to the great Spirit to
 find them and you well, and that love
 and friendship still continues between
 you and them -- Brothers,
 We have often heard that
 you were growing more industrious
 & since comeing among you it has afforded
 us much satisfaction to see the improve-
 ments you have made, that you have
 built comfortable house, fenced in many 
 
 Farms, and have such good Corn and
 other things growing, where the Land was
 so lately cover'd with trees and Bushes.
 We hope you will not be discouraged at
 the labour it takes to Clear your land
 for your land we believe is very good
 and if you farm it well, it will produce
 a great deal of Grain and Grass, which will
 enable you to keep your stocks of Cattle
 much better than you now do, and you
 will live more comfortably yourselves -- Brothers
 We see you have a great many
 Children and we want you to learn
 them to work while they are young
 for when Children grow up in Idleness
 they dont like to go to work afterwards
 and so get into Lazy habits -- Brothers,
 As we are very desirous to
 promote your welfare we have some
 things to propose for your consideration.
 We think if you would place two of
 your boys under the care of our friends
 at Tunesassa to be instructed in the
 farming business or learn to manage 
 the Mills, they might be of great use
 among your people - These Boys should
 be of Sober conduct and such as our friends
 would think suitable ot take - They might
 stay six months or longer if necessary
 and when they were instructed others
 might come in their places and by
 this means some of your Boys might be
 learn'd to carry on business as our friends
 do. Brothers,
 Two of our Women have been
 sometime at Tunesassa with a desire
 to instruct your Women in things that
 will make your lives more comfortable
 We hope you have received some
 benefit from some of your women
 learning how to make soap, which
 enables you them to keep your houses more
 Clean -- This is very good -- but we think
 if some of your girls would go to our
 women and learn how to spin flax and
 Wool it would be of great advantage to
 you and our friends will assist you in
 getting it made into Cloth -- Wool we
 dont expect you can get a great deal of
 yet, but we saw some flax of your own
 raising and our friends have a little 
 wool and a little flax which they
 will be willing to give you to begin with
 and next year you can raise more
 flax - A house is built for such of your
 girls to work in as incline to be instruc-
 ted and some Wheels provided --- Brothers,
 We are glad to observe you have
 made such good roads in many places
 along this River - this makes it com-
 frotable traveling and opens a way for you
 to get your Grain to the Mill -- We are
 satisfied with the proposals our friends
 have made to you with respect to grind-
 ing your grain and sawing your
 boards but we think it will be necessary
 for them to take toll after the time
 they propos'd to you, and it would be a
 satisfaction both to our friends and us
 if you would not bring your Grain
 to the Mill on the first day of the
 week as your friends the Quakers do not
 wish to be interrupted in the time of
 their Meeting or work on that day Brothers,
 If you wish us to send on any
 more tools for our friends to sell to you
 we hope you will tell us your minds as you
 knew we told you before we would send
 on a few tools Sythes, Sickels, Augurs and
 some such tools for our friends to sell to
 such of you as might want to buy,
 but that they should leave off lending --
 and we hope your blacksmiths will
 be industrious and make you what
 tools they can --- Brothers
 We have said much to you
 but we wish to add a little more - 
 Our friends in their speech have told
 you their desire "that all men should
 live in harmony and peace and love
 one another," and we know it is pleas-
 -ing to the Great Spirit for mankind to
 love one another and try to do good
 to each other -- we therefore desire
 you may all live in harmony and
 be like the family of one man --
 united together in good works and 
 then you will be strong, then when
 one of you fall another will help
 him up, and the Great Spirit will
 prosper you, and bless the work of your
 hands - Your Chiefs will then unite
 together in leading you on to do right. Brothers, we have often heard of your
 good resolutions against drinking whisky
 and other strong drink, and it has
 made our hearts glad to find you have
 kept these good resolutions, for you as
 well as us, are very sensible that long
 ago it was your greatest enemy, and
 that your quiting the use of it, has been
 a great blessing to you -- We wish you
 to keep your eyes open, and your
 minds strong, that you may not let
 this enemy rise again - and we desire
 that you will not buy or sell it any
 more for fear of offending the Great Spirit. Brothers
 There are other things which 
 does much harm, such as playing Cards
 Gameing and other idle practices - We
 hope you will keep out of these things
 as the hinder the good work we desire
 to promote among you --- Brothers Attend,
 You must not think
 our friends who live at Tunesassa have come
 there for the sake of pay to spend so much
 time among you, but felt their hearts
 so warmd with love to our Indian Bro-
 thers that they were made willing to
 leave their comfortable dwellings
 and near and dear friends in order to
 promote your welfare, and we believe
 their endeavours to do you good has
 been pleasing to the great Spirit which
 has made their minds easy in staying
 so long from their relations and friend
 we hope you will attend to the good
 advice they may give you, and as you
 continue to persevere in industry
 and sobriety, your friends will still
 be happy to see your improvement, 
 but if at any time you fall into
 your former habits of drinking, and
 other bad practices, it will discourage
 your friends the Quakers from assisting
 you Brothers
 As our friends at Tunesassa
 have the Mills and farm to attend to
 themselves you cannot expect them
 to do a great deal of work for you
 but if at any time you want instruction
 about fenceing, you farms, building 
 your houses, Laying out roads &c
 apply to them and they will be al-
 ways willing to give you such coun-
 -sel as they may think best --- Brothers
 We have now spoken our minds
 plainly and we wish you to speak plainly
 to us, that if there is any thing that
 is not understood between us, or between
 our friends and you, we may have the difficul-
 ty remov'd out of the way -- We intend
 to spend a few days more among
 you and go and view some more of your
 improvements that we may be enabled 
 to carry back a true account to our
 friends in their counsel at Philadelphia --
 9 Mo. 15th 1806 Isaac Bonsal John Philips Halliday Jackson After the foregoing was read and ex-
 -plain'd to them some verbal observations
 were made encourageing them to live in
 peace and harmony with their wives &
 not to let trifling matters part them
 but consider them companions for life
 for it was pleasing to the Great Spirit for
 man and Woman to live together in har-
 mony - also some remarks directing
 them to the inward principal of Light
 in the heart, which would make their
 minds uneasy when they did wrong, and
 afford them peace and tranquility when
 they did, that which was pleasing to the
 great Spirit -- They were also encoura-
 ged to live in harmony and friendship
 among themselves, that this would
 enable them to make a progress in the
 good work we were endeavouring to pro-
 mote among them, but if they split 
 and divided it would weaken them,
 and either part would be easy broken
 like a stick split into many pieces -- After being inform'd we had
 done speaking, they confer'd a while
 together and one of the Chiefs inform'd
 us it would take some time to consider
 of a reply, and that they would meet
 us in counsel tomorrow about noon &
 answer our Speeches -- Cornplanter (tho' not esteemd as a
 chief at this time) made a short speech
 to the Indians directing their attention
 to what we had said to them and told
 them it was all right and true - he
 being then on his way to Buffalo took
 leave of us for the present -- We sent infor-
 -mation by him to the Chiefs of Catarau-
 gus village that we expected to be there
 in a few days and would wish to
 see them -- This was the largest Counsel I had
 ever been at among them, A number
 of their principal Women attended
 and the Indians in general appear'd 
 more steady in their Conduct & more
 Clean and decent in their dress than I
 had ever saw them before -- their
 houses are also kept much cleaner
 than formerly, and one thing I several
 times observ'd which I thought something
 of a novelty among Indians & a ple[as]in[g]
 indication that they were beginning to be
 asham'd of their dirty way of liveing
 that when the women saw us aproa-
 -ching their Doors they immediately
 began to sweep their houses 16th This Morning about nine Oclock we
 rode up the River to Genesinguhta flats
 above the Cold Spring to view what
 improvements the Indians had made
 there -- we found a considerable num-
 -ber of Cornfields extended along the Creek
 between two and three miles from the
 River, enclos'd under good fence, and
 the Corn look'd well in the General
 being on land of a superior quality - We sat a while in Blue Eyes house
 eat some Indian Squashes, and on our
 way back, stopt to view Henery Abeals 
 farm -- He is setled some distance from
 the River in the woods by himself --
 and hath a neat little house built
 with a Pannel Door and Jack windows
 on a stately eminence at the head of
 a rich flat, and hath made a beginning
 to Clear land -- We return'd to the
 cold Spring about twelve Oclock and
 found the Indians in Counsel --In about
 an hour after they called us into the
 Counsel room, and after being seated
 one of the Chiefs call'd Mush stood
 up and spoke to us nearly as follows, Brothers
 When your young men came
 first to live amongst us they saw we
 were poor, they took pity upon us,
 and they told us they came to assist
 us -- At first we did not fully under-
 -stand what your intentions were, but
 after consulting among ourselves we
 thought it was, a great thing that you
 should come to live amongst us, to
 instruct us, being more than white
 people had ever done before. and we
 concluded to try you one, or five years 
 we said nothing more about it for three
 years, to see whether you were our friends
 or not -- You also brought tools on
 for us to work with in which we found
 a great advantage -- we then began to
 improve and do much better than before.
 You then wish'd to instruct our chil-
 dren to read and write - this we could
 not agree too because our people were
 then so fond of hunting & they would
 take their wives & children into the
 woods with them you must not think
 hard of this -- In our counsels with
 you at that time Cornplanter answer'd
 your speeches without consulting us,
 but it is not so now, we are all
 agreed to what we say --- Te,ki,an,da , generally called Blacksnake
 then arose and made reply to the address
 the Committee had sent with us,
 nearly as follows -- Brothers the Quakers,
 We expect it is the
 mind of the Great Spirit that we have
 met together in Counsel to day, and 
 we thank the Great Spirit that we
 are all well, and that he has given us
 a fine clear day to meet together -- Brothers,
 Yesterday you told us all
 the Speech you brought from the
 counsel at Philadelphia, and we thank
 our friends for it, especially our Old
 friend John Parrish , as it was likeing
 shakeing hands together with both
 men and Women -- You told us
 to Open our ears and listen to all you
 say -- now we hope you will make
 your minds easy, as we have but a few
 words to say -- You say you have
 often heard how we on Alligany
 are increasing in industry, and
 that you also heard our continued
 resolutions against the use of spirit
 -ous Liquors, and you hope we would
 not let it rise again, you wish your
 words might sink deep in our hearts. Brothers
 We are now all together 
 we suppose you feel yourselves
 happy and we also feel ourselves happy
 All the Indians and the white People know
 that the Great Spirit talks with our
 Prophet, it is now seven years since he
 first began to talk with him - & he told
 the Indians they must leave of drink-
 ing Whisky, and they have declin'd
 the use of it -- Brothers - 
 you must tell your friends
 when you go home to make their
 minds quite easy, for we are determined
 never to let the whisky rise again, and
 also to pursue habits of industry, and never
 them -- Your young men and us are
 like one - when we want any thing
 done we consult them and they assist
 us, and our Prophet tells us what to
 do and so we get instruction from both. Johnson Silverheels (a young Chief -
 rather disaffected) then made a speech
 to us nearly as follows --- Brothers
 You have told us you wished
 two of our Boys to go and live with
 your friends at Tunesassa to learn their Business and you 
 to have the care of them yourselves,
 & we have concluded to comply with
 your wishes, & let you have the choice of
 two, but we want you to tell us how
 they are going to live there, and
 what they are going to get by staying You also think best for some of our
 Girls to go to your women and learn
 how to work, but we want to know
 what them girls are going to get by
 working there -- You also wished
 to know if we wanted any more
 tools brought on to sell to sell to us,
 and we have agreed that if you can
 send on tools to sell cheaper than those
 you sent before, you may send them
 but if you cannot sell them cheaper
 we dont wish you to bring any as
 we can buy them cheaper elswhere Brothers you told us to speak our
 minds plainly and if there was any
 thing we did not like to let it be known
 We will now tell you of some things that
 is not quite agreable to us -- We all know
 there is but one God, who made us all
 and directs us all to do alike -- but we cannot
 all agree as there is so many Sinners,
 the reason is because we dont do as well

 as we know how -- The Great Spirit orders
 us all to do right --- We suppose you thought when you came
 to live among the Indians, the Great Spirit
 would be pleased with you -- The Great
 Spirit was not blind but could see every
 thing, and was pleasd with your liveing
 amongst us - as you have had no sickness
 among you since you first came -- It was but a short time you assisted
 us - for three years past you have
 not lent us any tools, and when you
 quit lending us tools we were like a
 man sleep just wakeing out of a sleep
 reach out his hands for help and you
 withdrew the necessary assistance --
 we still expected to get tools to Borrow after
 you brought tools to sell to us - and
 since we have found out the mind
 of the Great Spirit, we think he is best
 pleas'd when People use one another well, 
 and he is pleas'd when people give
 one another victuals when they go to their
 houses whether they are hungry or not
 we think when our people go to the Mill,
 and get hungry, your friends ought to
 feed them, or when Indians come from
 other Towns they ought also to feed them
 this would be pleasing to us, as this is
 the custom among ourselves -- We have now told you our minds
 plainly because you told us so many
 good things since you came to see us -- John Pierce then arose and made
 the following speech Brothers
 I have a few words to say --
 what I am going to say is about the
 great Spirit, as you told us a great
 deal about it yesterday, and it has sunk
 deep in my mind -- We are poor
 and ought to be pitied - I us'd to have ma-
 ny bad tricks but have concluded to quit
 them and try to instruct others -- I know
 what Ideas the Quakers have, they are always 
 always thinking abou the Great spirit
 and the have no crook in their mind, nor
 dont follow bad ways -- One thing you told
 us struck me very deep -- You said if we
 done well here and pleas'd the Good Spirit
 we should meet again in a better world --
 I want you, when you go home, to tell
 Jonathan Thomas of the resolution I have
 taken to do well, because he often told me
 about these things, & advis'd me to do better --
 Two of us have now agree'd to assist the
 Chiefs and instruct the other Indians
 & I hope we will try more and more to do
 better for we know we dont all do right
 about our Wives but we mean to try to do
 better, and if the Chiefs dont do right we
 will try to help them, & if one falls another
 will help him up ---- Con,nu,di,a (their Prophet so call'd)
 then arose and spoke to the following
 effect -- Brothers,
 We have now told you all we
 agreed to say, except a few words I will
 ad - I thank our friends in Philadelphia
 & I have it on my mind to do as you 
 told us not to let those bad things
 rise again -- It is me that talks about
 what the Great Spirit wishes us to do, &
 I always try to instruct the Chiefs and
 others to do right & to be of one mind as
 it is the will of the Great Spirit that all
 people should be of one mind, but some of them
 will not listen to what I say -- In six days
 I expect to go to buffalo Creek, and six men
 with me and there I expect to meet a
 great many Indians from Onieda and
 other places & there I will speake these
 things you have told us to them, as if I was
 at home -- Brothers, the Great Spirit hears all
 we now say, and is glad to see us all well
 together -- I hope he will preserve you
 safe home & that you may find your fami-
 lys all well and this is the wish of all the
 Indians --- Brothers this is all we got to say -- After a little conferrence among ourselves
 we replied to them nearly as
 follows --- Brothers
 We are glad to meet you again
 in counsel & to find that you and us
 are so much of one mind, about most
 of the things we have been speaking to
 you about. But we think there are
 a few things which you have not quite
 understood, & we will now explain to
 you -- You mention that you wish to
 know what we will give those Boys we
 propose takeing to instruct -- You may
 understand that our friends will find
 them in victuals which with the instruc
 -tion they give them we think will be
 a sufficient compensation for all the
 benefit they will receive from them - You also enquire what we will
 give those Girls that go to our Women
 to learn to work -- These Girls are to
 find their own provisions, & our friends
 will find them some wool and some
 flax & instruct them how to spin
 it, & assist them getting it made into
 cloth, & that Cloth will be yours -- 
 And as you think you can buy
 tools Cheaper than our friends sell to
 you -- we think it will be best not to
 send on any more tools, The tools that
 was sent, has been sold to you at the
 same price the cost us, and we can not
 afford them at a lower Price - You may remember that the first par-
 cel of tools we brought among you, was
 all given up three years ago, and you
 were desir'd to chose some of your Chiefs
 to take care of them -- You were then
 told our young men, must quit lend-
 ing you tools & this account was car-
 ried back to the Counsel at Philadelphia
 and our friends was satisfied with it.
 But you now complain that we assisted
 you but a short time - that for three
 years past you could get no tools
 to Borrow, and say when we quit lending
 you tools, you were just like a man -
 wakeing out of a sleep, reaching out his 
 hands for help and the necessary assistence was 
 withdrawn from him -- We answer
 that when we first came among the Indians,
 we considered them as Children begining
 to learn to walk, and then we thought
 necessary to assist them, but after they
 had made some progress, and learn'd to
 do many things: it was not so necessary --
 that now we did not expect to work much
 for the Indians, but to teach them to work for
 themselves - And that Children when they
 were learning to walk must be taken by the
 hand and helpt along, but when they got
 able to go alone, they learn'd the faster
 by that assistance being withdrawn from
 them -- You also complain that our friends
 at Tunesassa will not give you victuals
 when you go to the mill or when you are 
 there about your own business -- We now want
 you to understand plainly, that our
 friends at Tunesassa are not come there
 to feed you -- there is a great many of
 you, and but one family of them and
 if they always entertained you, when you
 went to the Mill, or when you were 
 there upon other occasions, and
 wanted victuals, it would take our women
 most of their time, that they would
 have no time to instruct the Indians
 in useful things -- You also know there
 are some of your people, does not like
 work very well - these might go & stay
 several days liveing on our friends, &
 and this would be unreasonable -- You say it is a common thing for you
 to entertain one another - this is very
 good - you may also understand it is a
 common thing among your friends
 the Quakers to entertain one another
 when ever the go to see each other, and
 stand in need of victuals, and if any
 of you will visit us in our settlements
 we will entertain you freely - but we
 dont wish you to give our friends at
 Tunesassa any trouble about giveing you
 victuals - for if the fed all the Indians that
 wanted victuals from them they would
 not be able to raise a supply, and by that
 means might be forc'd to break up the settlement Some reply was also given to the speech
 John Pierce made importing that we hope'd
 he would keep strong in these good resolutions
 & that the Chiefs would unite together in
 trying to do good, for they might be asured
 that when they were endeavouring to pro-
 -mote one anothers good they were doing right
 & this conduct would be pleasing to the Great
 Spirit - but when they try'd to hurt one another
 they offended the Great Spirit -- that while
 they were united together in good works
 they were like a cord made of many strings
 not easily broken - but when they differ'd
 and disagreed among themselves they were
 like the strings which composed that cord
 being seperated from each other might
 by this means be the more easily Broken.
 and we were also glad they intended to
 do better with respect to their wives, and
 hoped they would remain in this mind as
 the Great Spirit would be better pleasd with
 them if they did so -- Henery Abeal then made a speech
 to us, which was interpreted by Peter Snider 
 from which the following is an extract -- Brothers the Quakers
 I have often acted
 as interpreter between you and the Indi-
 ans, and some times when you are gone 
 they complain and say I did not tell
 them the truth, and perhaps now after
 you go away they will tell me and Peter
 Snider we are both Liars, & therefore I am
 determined to speak right out plainly -- Brothers,
 The Indians have understood
 there was a large sum of Money raisd by
 the Quakers to assist them, & they want to
 know how this money was laid out, and
 whether these Mills was paid for out of that
 Money, for you have built them Mills &
 the Indians buy Boards from you, and
 sometimes they can't tell whether you
 are helping them, or they helping you." He also made some observations on their
 improvement since we first came amongst
 them, contrasting their present situation
 with what it then was, & acknowledged
 their present conditition was much better
 and refer'd to me, to witness the same -- This was replie'd to nearly as follows: 
 that when we first came undertook to
 assist the Indians a large sum of Money
 was rais'd, & the first settlement was made
 among their Brethren the Onieda Indians
 which continued near four years and
 a great deal of money was spent there -- 
 
 that we had made several presents to some
 of the Indians of different Nations to the
 westward - that we had furnished the Catarau-
 gus Buffalo and Tonewanta Indians with
 divers articles - and when the Settlement
 was first made at Allegany it was a great
 expense, & buying this land and building
 these Mills cost a great deal of Money,
 but that if ever they should be sold to
 other People, the money would be apli'd
 to the use of the Indians some where
 in some way or other -- that now they
 might plainly see how a great deal
 of money had been expended, & we still
 wish'd to keep a little in Bank to assist
 them more, but that none of the
 maoney rais'd for the benefit of the
 Indians would ever be appli'd to any
 other purpose ---- Some further remarks were made on
 both sides - & the Indians inform'd us they
 were satisfied about the Boys and Girls
 we propos'd takeing to instruct & left
 it to their friends at Tunesassa to make
 the Choice -- We told them we had done speaking and
 hop'd we fully understood each other, that
 all things were now strait and smoother
 and would bid them farewell in love
 and friendship -- which we did most of the
 Indians shakeing hands with us in a friend-
 -ly Manner -- The Counsel lasted about four hours --
 Several of their principal Women being
 present - & notwithstanding some little
 matters occur'd rather unusual,and
 a little disagreable (but we believd occa-
 sioned by one or two of their young assume
 ing Chiefs without due considerations, who
 are more dispos'd to find fault from a
 disposition of Covetousness than to return
 gratitude for the many benefits they
 have receiv'd from the kindness our friends
 have shown them) yet we left them pretty
 much to our satisfaction, & our friends
 at Tunesassa were of the opinion our
 Communications to the Indians would
 have a good effect at the present time -- Their speeches to us were all interpreted
 by Peter Snider and not being well qualifi- ed 
 for the service a considerable loss was sus-
 taind -- and a very evident loss among the
 Indians for want of a Chief qualified to
 deliver their Speeches with ease and cor-
 rectness, notwithstanding they had previ-
 ously agreed upon the subjects of their com
 munications -- 17th The most of this day employ'd in write-
 ing &c. In the afternoon Cornplanters 
 Sister (who is a principal woman and was pre-
 -sent at the Counsel) came to see us and
 told us she did not feel satisfied with
 the Speech Silverheels made to us yeas-
 terday - that it was a very bad speech,
 & she hoped we would not make our
 minds uneasy about it. She said she
 was glad to see us & the Indians were
 generally satisfied with us - and she
 hoped we would be encouraged, for she
 knew the Women wished the Girls to learn
 & many of the Girls also wish'd to be in-
 structed, & said our Women were fully
 capable of instructing them -- Several
 Girls came in the afternon and spun
 and knit a little ---- 18th Some preparations makeing towards
 leaveing our friends tomorrow -- With respect to the Indians improve
 ment in the general, it appears from
 our obsevation and the account of our
 friends here that they continue to perseve-re
 in habits of industry - near 100 new
 houses have been built since the commit-
 -tee visited them three years ago most of
 them well put up with hewn Logs -
 very neatly notcht in at the Corners --
 many of them cover'd with shingles
 & have pannel Doors and Glass Windows
 and the houses kept much cleaner than
 formerly so that an evident Change in
 this respect has taken place since our
 women came among them -- Their farms are enclos'd under good
 fence from 8 to 10 rails high, and more
 detatch'd from each other than formerly --
 a much greater proportion of Corn plan-
 ted this season then has been known
 before which generally looks well -- Many of them have rais'd Wheat & Oats --
 Several have raisd flax and we saw some
 buckwheat growing, besides Potatoes, Turnips 
0 &c in abundance -- We also saw some
 lots sow'd with Timothy -- They appear'd to
 be clearing more land in many places some of
 which is intended to be put in, with Wheat
 this fall -- They have a good stock of Cattle
 and abundance of Swine -- They have several
 horses among them, but the greater part
 of their farming is done Drawing Logs
 &c is done with Oxen -- Their improve-
 ment in divers respects since I left them, has
 rather exceeded my expectation & quite
 equal to any improvement I have observ'd
 in any of the new settlements made by
 Whites in the same length oftime, & their
 houses better put up, & fences in a general way
 far superior to those made by White set-
 lers in the Back parts of Pensylvania &
 York States. Their continued resolutions
 against the use of Spiritous Liquors af-
 -fords an encourageing prospect, that friends
 Labour among them has been peculiarly blest.
 Several Old Men whom I well knew had former
 been very much addicted to drinking and
 generally intoxicated when they could
 obtain Liquor, is now become sober &
 industrious, & very few Instances of intoxication - 
 have occur'd among the Allegany
 Indians for two or three years past - towards
 the Close of our last interview I observ'd
 to them "the satisfaction I felt in seeing
 the happy change had taken place among
 them in this respect, that when I and
 my companions first came among them
 & setled at Genesinguhta it was disagre
 able being in their Towns
 on account of the Liquor -- that now I
 could see them at work on their farms,
 Building houses, & clearing Land but then it
 was common to see them in their Towns
 several of their old people in a huddle
 together, trying to prop one another from
 falling" -- One of the Old Women
 who was present - cry'd out in the Coun-
 sel & said "that was the truth" --- In the Course of this day an Indian chief call'd
 Jacob Snow (with Captain Bone & several
 others) came to see us & said he was not satis
 fied with the Speech Silverheels made to
 us at the Counsel, & that the Indians in
 general was much displeas'd with it
 that most of them was well satisfied with 
 Our proceedings & hope'd we would
 not think of leaveing them to themselves
 for that would make his mind very uneasy
 & he hop'd we would not tell the speech of that
 young Chief to the Counsel at Philadelphia
 for altho. he had got liberty from the Other
 Chiefs to make such a speech, it was by
 importunity, and was very contrary
 to their wishes -- but if we did speak of
 it to our friends at Philadelphia we must
 also tell them what he had now told us - He also told us he was very desirous to
 have one of his children educated with
 our friends, and taught the same
 ways and some thoughts of the Quakers --
 & wish'd us to give him a grant that it
 should be so educated when it was old
 enough it being now but two years
 old -- This request we could not com
 ply with, as we told him it was uncer-tain
 whether any friends would remain at
 Tunesassa so long a time --- He appeard
 to be a sober sensible Man, said he
 was very desirous to become a good
 farmer, we understand has a good deal
 of money, and shew'd us several deeds,
 he had forlots of Ground he had purcha-
 sed from the White people in some 
 of the villages down the River --- 19th The Morning fair about seven Oclock we
 took leave of our friends at Tunesassa and set
 out for Cataraugus Jacob Taylor accompanying
 us -- We rode up the river to Tusquirewuhty
 valley near to the upper settlement of Indians
 & as we past along a number of them came
 out to bid us farewell - & many of them
 were at work in the woods mauling rails
 Clearing Land &c -- We also saw a number
 of large Cornfields we had not observ'd on
 our way down the River -- & several houses
 Building -- John Peirce (whose Indian
 name is Tus,sky) is building a house
 at the Cold Spring of an elegant construction
 being two stories high - weather boarded on
 the outside & intended to be seald within --
 John Bell is employ'd in doing the Carpen-
 ter work for him & in his speech to us at the
 Counsel the 16th instant he told us "that he
 had a job of work in hands now with which
 he thought the great Spirit would be
 well pleas'd" -- Leaveing the Allegany
 River we rode up this valley on a new
 road cut by the holland Company 
 leading from the west Branch of
 Susquehannah to Lake Erie a little
 south of the Mouth of Cateraugus River -
 pasing by the navigable waters of the
 Conewango north of Chatoughqua Lake -- This road was possible for horses & not
 much more can be said in its favour altho
 the ground will admit of a Good road being
 made -- We traveld on it about 14 Miles
 takeing a circuitous route to escape a
 very bad piece of road in the Old Indian 
 path -- On our way traveling an Indian
 path this afternoon, I discover'd a log I lay
 under one night, without fire & snow
 on the Ground, when traveling the same
 path alone near eight years before -- This evening we enampt on a branch of the
 Cataraugus River at the foot of the broad
 Mountain, haveing roade about 35 Miles Mostly
 thro fertile land of a good quality -- Supt on
 Chocolate & the weather being pleasant
 had Comfortable lodgeing beside the fire on
 our Blankets-- 20th Breakfasted at our Lodgeing (which
 we nam'd Bonsals Camp) and cross'd the
 broad Mountain about 12 miles over to
 Catauraugus River -- on our way crossing
 this mountain we overtook a company
 of Munsy Indians who had been out hunting
 they left the road to let us past but kept very
 close to our heels - one Woman was in their
 company mounted on horseback carrying
 several great packs of Skins and a young
 Child in her arms. In descending this
 mountain we had a remarkable steep
 narrow ridge to go down for several hundred
 feet and only just wide enough for one horse to
 travel on, with any degree of safety, and we
 thought dangerous to sit on horseback, but
 the Indian Woman rode down with as much
 ease & unconcernedness as one of our Women
 would ride a Square in Philadelphia -- After Crossing the River we stop & fed our
 horses eat some ourselves and spent a little time
 in viewing a very rich flat at the head
 of the Indians reservasion being land of
 the first quality cover'd in many places 
 cover'd with Large black Walnut & on
 the South side of the River a fine Stream
 of Water flowing thro' it forming a good
 Millseat -- Rode down the River about
 12 miles further to the Seneca village, pasing
 thro. the Village of Muncy or Deleware
 Indians who live near them -- We arivd
 about three Oclock found the Indians
 Generally at home and glad to see us --
 Took our quarters at Waundeguhtas 
 the Chief Warriors house made ourselves
 some chocolate and his wife was very kind
 in helping us to such provisions as they had --
 This evening we proposed to the Chief
 Warrior meeting them in Counsel to mor-
 row, to which he readily assented & ten
 Oclock was the hour appointed for that
 purpose --- 21st Last Night a little rain fell
 with a good deal of thunder and Lightening
 The Indians told us there had been no rain
 there before for near 20 days -- We lodg'd
 in a new house the Chief warrior had
 built - the lower story of which was oc-
 cupied as a Barn, haveing some Wheat 
 and Corn laying in it & altho we
 were in the Second Story some of 
 our company complain'd hard of of disagre-
 -able bedfellows and about midnight
 were somewhat alarm'd by the Yeling of
 the Indians one of our company enquire
 ing whether it was wolves -- We understood
 they were performing some kind of Ceremony
 round a sick Child ---- This morning we committed a
 sort speech to writeing which we thought
 necessary to communicate to them at the
 Counsel & a little after 10 O clock about
 19 of their Chiefs & principle men
 assembled in the Camber we lodg'd in,
 & the Chief Warriors Wife with them -- Soon after being sealed the Chief
 Warior Arose, and said "that four days
 ago he had a message by Cornplanter that
 some of the Quakers was comeing to see them
 We suppose (said he) you are the people
 we heard of, and are glad and thankful 
 to the Great Spirit for preserveing
 you on your Long Journey, so that you
 have arived here in safety and no accident
 has befallen you on the way" -- and after
 some further remarks relative to our
 Comeing said they were now ready
 to hear us speak -- Our Speech was then read, and
 Interpreted by Henry York being as
 follows --- To the Chiefs and others of the
 Seneca Nation of Indians at Catarau-
 gus ---- Brothers
 As We have been seeing
 your Brethren at Allegany we felt
 such strong desires for your welfare as
 to induce us to come this way and take
 you by the hand, that we might talk
 with you, and know what progress
 you are makeing in farming and
 other good works ---- Brothers
 We feel happy in once more 
 being among you, and believe you
 have made some advancement since our
 friends visited you three years ago - We now
 want to encourage you to industry in the
 Cultivation of your Land, for your Land we
 see is very good and easy Clear'd, and will
 produce a great deal of wheat as well as Corn
 if you are industrious and farm it well --- Brothers
 We wish you to learn your Boys to
 work while they are young and by this
 means they will get to love work and be
 able to assist you when they grow older --
 and as you become industrious and raise
 plenty of grain it will afford you a
 much better Liveing & more certain than
 depending on huntery ---- Brothers
 We see you have a good stock
 of Cattle & we hope you are careful to
 provide plenty of fodder for them in the
 winter -- We think if you would sow some
 of your rich Bottoms on the River with
 Timothy it would afford you a great deal 
 of hay and be an easy way of keeping
 your Cattle -- Brothers
 As we have furnish'd you with
 a set of smith tools, we hope your young
 men will be industrious in trying to
 learn that business, that they may be
 able to make and mend your tools -- Brothers
 We understand that many of
 your people have left of drinking Whisky
 and we want to encourage you all
 to quit this practice, and to keep your
 minds strong against it, for we know
 it has been the ruin of a great many
 White people, & you know it has been
 a great hurt to the Indians and helpt
 to keep them poor -- but we hope many
 of you have got your eyes open to see that
 Whisky and other strong drinks has been
 your great enemy, and we now want
 you to unite together in keeping this
 enemy from riseing up again, and
 this we believe will be pleasing to the Great Spirit. Brothers,
 we dont wish to say a great deal
 to you at this time, but rather to encourage
 you to listen to the voice of the good Spirit
 in your own hearts which will teach you
 what is right, and as you obey its dictates
 will make you feel happy in your selves
 and live in love and friendship with one
 another, and with Mankind generally. Brothers if you do what the good
 Spirit tells you is right it will strength
 -en your desires to do good & will make
 you strong in all your good resolutions
 will bless you in this world and make
 you happy when you die --- Cataraugus 9 Mo 21st 1806 Isaac Bonsal John Philips Halliday Jackson The Indians confer'd a few minutes
 together, & the Chief Warrior presently
 stood up and made reply to each particular
 part of our Speech in substence nearly
 as follows --- That they were very glad to hear our
 Speech and thankful to the Great Spirit
 for the advice we had given them - that our
 advice heretofore had been very useful and
 encourageing to them to pursue industrious
 habits and they had already got their
 eyes open and were determined to go on
 in the Cultivation of their Land, for they
 knew their Land was very good and they
 suppos'd it was the mind of the Great
 Spirit that they were setled here in this
 good Land -- that they were determined
 to take our advice in learning their
 Children to work while they were young
 & they had for several years past been
 in the practice of learning them -- that
 ten years ago they had little or no cattle
 or stock of any kind, but now they
 were geting plenty and our advice was
 very good respecting their provideing
 fodder, & that some of them had already
 made a beginning to sow Timothy seed-
 for they had sometimes found it diffi-cult 
 to bring their cattle thro' the Winter -- He also said they were very thankful
 for the Smiths Tools we had sent them
 and that two of their young men was
 active at the smiths business - that some
 years ago if they broke a hoe or an ax they
 must go thirty miles to get it mended --
 which took a great deal of time besides
 paying for it, but now their smiths
 were capable of doing such things for them
 and they only last an hour or two ---- He further said, we might rely upon
 it they had taken up strong resolutions against
 the use of Whisky and other strong drink --
 and that all that was then present were Chiefs
 and each of them kept a daily watch over
 the rest of the Indians to caution them
 against drinking Whisky playing Ba
 and other bad practices which they believ'd
 was not pleasing to the Great Spirit --
 but were of the mind the Great Spirit
 was better pleased with them when they
 took hold of the hoe and the Ax and went
 to work -- that since they had got 
 their Eyes open to see, they were
 sensible that strong drink had done them
 a great deal of mischief and kept them
 poor, but now they had got master of it
 & was determined never to let it rise again
 & were in hopes all the Indians of the six
 nations would in time become master of it. He also said they were very thankful
 we had given them our speech upon
 paper & deliver'd it to them & said they
 would not only advise their young peo-
 ple themselves but would have our speech
 to apply to strengthen their minds -
 & since they had taken up these good
 resolutions they had daily conferrences
 on these Subjects & were continually
 trying to encourage one another in
 good works -- He then made some remarks
 about their saw Mill which he said
 they were very anxious to have repair'd
 this fall, & Jacob Taylor inform'd them
 he was then on his way to Buffalo
 to procure a Millright to do it for
 them -- for which they returnd many thanks After he had done speaking each
 of our company had some further
 remarks to make tending to strengthen
 them in their Good resolutions, and
 encourage them to persevere in habits
 of industry and Sobriety, to all which
 the Chiefs Warrier particularly replied --
 addressing each of us,& first rehearsing what
 we had said nearly verbatim, & concluded
 with saying, "he hop'd the Great Spirit
 would preserve us in as good health as
 we now were, till we got home to our
 wives & Children, & that on our arival
 we might find them all well and all
 the Great men at our Counsel in Phila. We then shook hands with them &
 ended the Counsel which was the
 most satisfactory one we have had
 among the Indians, the most of them
 being sober solid looking Men, and
 the Chief Warrior a man of grave
 deportment retentive memory &
 sound Judgement fully capable of
 retaining every thing we had communicated Presently after the Counsel, the chiefs
 wife brought us up some dinner of her
 own prepareing, of which some of us eat
 hearty, but some others partook but
 spareingly of her bounty --- The Indians of this Village, have
 a large extent of ground under good
 fence in one enclosure stretching
 along the River for near three miles
 on a very rich bottom -- a great deal
 of which is planted with Corn and looks
 well some of it they are now pulling
 nearly all these improvements
 have been made within three years.
 They have a pretty large stock of Cattle
 and Swine & the extensive natural
 Meadows that lay contiguous to them
 affords them a great outlet to feed in
 & the most elegible place for raising Cattle
 of any I have ever seen on Indians Grounds.
 But altho their situation is so very
 favourable for Agriculture they have
 by no means made such a progress
 therein as the Allegany Indians, 
 neither are their houses & Clothes
 kept so clean and neat which is a strong
 evidence that friends Labour and exam-
 ple at Allegany has had a powerful
 effect in these respects ---- Being now near the extent of our
 Journey - John Philips & myself propos'd
 takeing our route homewards by way of
 Buffalo & Genesee - Isaac Bonsal & Nicho-
 -las Waln being bound for the state of
 Ohio by way of Pressqu Isle -- we concluded
 to go down to the Lake near the Mouth
 of Cataraugus River and Lodge this night
 together -- Accordingly between four and
 five oclock we set off (most of the Indians
 in the village comeing to to bid us fare-
 well) and rode down the River through
 some fine natural meadows coverd
 with much Grass and herbage & rich wal-
 nut flats five Miles to Captain Sidness

 Tavern - and we ferry'd over the River
 near the Lake in a flat -- We also saw
 a number haystacks on the way which
 was cut and put up by the Indians -- As we apprehended some advantage
 might arise from takeing some notice
 of the Muncy Indians who live near
 the Senecas & no oppertunity likely to
 offer to meet them in Counsel we conclu-
 ded to write a short address and leave
 with Jacob Taylor to read and explain to
 them on his return, accordingly this
 evening the following was agreed upon
 for that purpose ---- To the Chiefs and others of the Mun-
 cy Village of Indians setled near the Catarau
 -gus River
Friends and Brothers As we have
 been on a visit to the Indians at Alegany
 and also to see your near neighbours the
 Senecas at Cataraugus, we feel such strong
 desires for your welfare that we want
 to say a few words to you tho we cannot
 at this time meet you in Counsel -- Brothers
 It is now several years since
 we first began to encourage the Seneca
 Nation of Indians to Cultivate their
 land - and some of them have hearken
 ed to our advice, and tell us they are 
 in a much better condition than
 they were before they began to be so
 Industrious -- Brothers
 As we passed along thro' your
 Town we were very thoughtful about
 you, and we want you should open your
 ears and listen to our talk -- We don't want any thing from you, but we
 wish to encourage you to take up work, &
 to pursue those good ways we will point
 out to you which will make your lives
 more comfortable --- Brothers
 You know that Game is Getting
 scarce and sometimes in the year you
 have no certainty of procureing a liveing
 by hunting - how necessary then is it
 for you to learn to work and raise plenty
 of Corn and other good things that will
 grow out of the Ground -- you may
 also raise plenty of Cattle & Swine
 which will be much more certain than
 the Deer and the Bear --- Brothers
 As our desires for the wel-
 fare of all our Indian Brothers are
 Strong, we want to speak a few words
 more in your Ears -- We have seen
 that many of the Indian Tribes have
 been much hurt by the use of Whisky
 and Other Strong drink, & we wish
 to encourage you to take up strong
 resolutions to quit the practice of
 drinking it as some of your brethren
 the Senecas have done - By drinking
 much Whisky you spend your Money
 your Skins and many other things
 which you might buy tools to go to
 farming with & also supply yourselves
 with Cattle and Other useful Animals - Brothers
 While you continue to drink
 Whisky & other strong drink, you can not
 expect to improve your land, or to live
 comfortable but if you leave of this
 practice, you will then be able to pro-
 vide yourselves a more comfortable
 Liveing & being Sober & industrious
 The Great Spirit will be pleased with
 you & do you good --- You know that by drinking 
 Whisky you distress your own mind
 & bring trouble on your selves & this
 is displeasing to the Great Spirit -- Brothers
 We send this by our friend
 Jacob Taylor , who is also a friend to
 the Indians, & who will have this speech
 read & explaind to you --- We are your friends and Brothers
Cataraugus 9 Mo 21st John Philips Isaac Bonsal Halliday Jackson 22nd Breakfasted at our Lodgeing and about
 8 Oclock took leave of our Companions I.B. &
 N. Waln Jr. & Jacob Taylor accompanying
 us - we had a pleasant Journey along the
 beautiful Margin of Lake Erie 36 Miles to
