Genesinguhta Correspondence
Between the Committee
 on Indian affairs at
Philadelphia and
the Friends residing amongst
the Seneca Nation of Indians
settled on the Allegheny 
 River First Letter to the Committee
 on Indian affairs-- Dear Friends Under the protection of
 a Merciful Creator we are favored to enjoy
 a good state of health, and we do know that
 many of you have sympathizing Hearts
 with us, and very tender feelings for the good
 of those People we are placed amongst; there
fore we feel duty bound to write to you at
 every convenient opportunity, letting you
 know how the business we are entrusted with is
 going on amongst us. The Indians continue to treat us with
 great civility and respect, and we believe there
 is no cause of discouragement in the present
 undertaking amongst them; though we cannot
 expect a great deal done by them at Farming
 until they are better supplied with
 working Creatures— 
 We have assisted them in building several houses and
 have made a considerable progress in Farming on our
 own Lot for what time we have been on it; our
 Corn, Potatoes Garden etc. affords a beautiful
 aspect, and we intend to sow some Wheat and Rye
 this Fall if we can procure Seed, which can-
not be obtained nearer than Franklin and Pitts-
burgh that we know of— We are also
 about preparing to build ourselves a com-
fortable house before Winter sets in We are your affectionate Friends Genesinguhta
 7th mo 29th 1798 Henry Simmons Joel Swayne & Halliday Jackson NB We have received no accounts from Philadel-
phia or parts Adjacent since we left them 24 of 10th mo. We received the following of
 Thomas Wistar who was appointed to answer our
 Letters on behalf of the Committee when nothing
 of importance required their Uniting therein-- Dear Friends, At a meeting of the Indian
 Committee held last month, your joint Letter
 was read the contents whereof was very satisfactory
 to such of the Members as were present, who
 were few in number owing to a renewed dispensation of sickness
 and Mortality which has been permitted
 again to visit poor Philadelphia, and which
 though most prevalent in the Northern &
 Southern extremities of the City has spread
 pretty generally thro' it, and driven the
 Greater part of the inhabitants from their
 Homes; and by the latest accounts I have
 received of those that remain, from fifty
 to sixty are daily removed from this muta
ble state— I (with my family) have been removed 
 to this place about two weeks during which time
 I have not had an opportunity of receiving any
 letters that may have been directed to me at
 Philadelphia, and from not having my papers
 with me have it not in my power to refer to
 the dates of your Letters, but if my recollection
 is correct have received but one from you Joint
-ly, and one from H. Jackson (the latter of which
 it is my wish to answer shortly)— Dear friends, in the exiled, humiliated Situation
 in which I at present am, do not feel myself
 capable of saying much more to you, than
 that I continue to hope the dedication you
 have manifested in the cause of humanity
 and good will to man, may, as you continue
 properly under the exercise, yield you the unde-
scribable reward of peace in your own bosoms
 & that during the trying seperation you
 experience from the Bosom of Society, you may
 be favored to feel the support of the everlasting
 arms-- I am affectionately Your fr Thomas Wistar Monmouth New Jersey

 To H.J. J.S. H Simmons 2nd Letter to the Committee 11th mo. 16th 1798
 Wrote by my companions when I was on a Journey. 
 Dear Friends Since we wrote to you we received
 a letter from Thomas Wistar which gave us an
 account that the Yellow Fever had again been
 permitted to visit the City of Philadelphia,
 no doubt but it has been a very distressing time
 to many--We have been employed the
 latter part of this Season in building a comfortable two
 story log house 18 by 22 feet, covered with
 Pine Shingles, Sellar’d underneath, and the
 Chimney composed of Stone and Clay--
We have erected a good stable large enough
 to accommodate our Horses and a Cow, also
 assisted several of the Indians in building
 etc. We have lately bought a dry Cow of one
 of the Indians who was desirous of parting
 with her, in hopes that she will supply us
 with Milk next Summer-- We expect shortly to commence a School 
 at Conescotago as the children are generally at that
 place-- We are at present in a reasonable state of
 health and remain your loving Friends Henry Simmons & Joel Swayne 
& Halliday Jackson being Absent on a Journey
 to Cattaraugus with a young man who met
 with an accident which disabled him from
 Walking and not returning so soon as we
 expected, and an Indian now waiting to take
 the letter to fort franklin we think it
 expedient to send it without his Name 3rd Letter to the Committee 1st mo. 23rd 1799
 Dear Friends, We have written two letters to you
 since our settling here the last of which was dated
 16 of 11 mo 98, and altho’ we have received no
 answer from you in a Collective capacity we
 doubt not but many of you sympathize with
 us, and we are often mercifully favored to feel the
 help of your Spirits cooperating and strength- 
 -ening us in our present engagement—
We expect there are letters from you delayed at
 Pittsburgh or Franklin for want of opportunities
 of forwarding them to us, which is very rare
 at this Season of the Year otherwise we would write
 oftener to you than we do We received a plentiful increase of the most
 of our Summer produce, and also prepared ground
 to sow several bushels of Winter Grain, but the
 River being so low we got disappointed in getting
 Seed, altho’ we wrote to Pittsburgh for it soon
 after Harvest and our Agents there forwarded
 it to Franklin for us—We expect it to
 come forward in the Spring and do to sow
 another year—Several of the Young Indians
 manifest some inclination to take up work, and
 last fall we had one employ'd a while at our
 business—We have kept up a School at
 Conishadaga this Winter in one of the Indians
 Houses where from 12 to 25 Children have attended
 who appear to make as much progress in learn-
ing-
 as can reasonably be expected: and we have had
 in contemplation the propriety of erecting a
 School house at that place the ensuing Summer
 as the Children are principally there, we think
 it will be of the most general utility, which
 we submit to You—The most of the
 Cloth, Linen, etc. which You sent with us, we
 have exchang'd for Meat, Boards, and other
 Necessaries we stood in need of, and a little of
 it we sold for money to accommodate they
 Indians at a price to reimburse the accruing expen
ses of bringing it here— We think it will be necessary for us to be furnish'd
 with a Yoke of Oxen to go on with Farming the
 ensuing Summer, as one of our horses is a
 little lame and the ground very hard to break
 up and we wish to be able to assist they Indians
 a little at Farming—We sent you word in
 our last letter that we had purchased a dry Cow
 which we since find is not likely to supply us with
 Milk, and if a Yoke of Oxen is sent it would be
 a great accommodation to us if a good Milk
 Cow was sent with them, and the one we have at
 present will do for Beef next Fall We also think it may tend to the promotion
 of the work and believe it expedient to Submit
 to you the consideration of sending us the
 following articles as early as practicable next
 Spring to Wit A Set of Smith Tools 1 Bar of Iron 1 do steel 1 faggot of Nail rods 1 pair of Cart Wheels 1 Doz. Sythes made Short & Strong 3 or 4 Sickels 6 Sets of Sythe Hangings 6 long Drawing knives 2 Broad Axes 2 Firmer Gouges [illegible abbreviations] 
 2 Mill Picks to make Grindstone 1 piece of Strong Cloth 1 do of Ticklenburgh or strong linen 1 do of Blanketing a few dozens of pocketknives 
 a few do of coarse and fine Combs Some coarse Needles & thread 1 Peck of Flax seed 1 do of Timothy seed ½ do Clover Seed 2 Doz. Spelling Books 3 or 4 do. Trimmers 6 Testaments 6 Slates & Pencils 1 or 2 School Masters assistants Some writing papers & Quills 2 Bushels of Salt 3 Barrels of Flower Some Chocolate We may also inform you we are hard set
 to keep enough of the falling axes at home for
 our own use if a few more was sent the would
 be acceptable The Cattle and some of these
 articles we expect by your order may be procured
 at Pittsburgh and altho’ some of them may not
 be immediately wanted here we think it will
 be the best economy to send them altogether
 as it is difficult and expensive getting things
 conveyed to us—The Sythes that were sent last
 Spring were not suitable for the purpose, and
 the drawing knives were too short and Slim If a Smith or other well qualified Person
 should offer we hope He will be encourage
ed to come forward, as there is a probability
 of one of us being profitably stationed at
 the lower Village, to superintend the School
 and other wise endeavor to promote the
 desirable work of Civilization—and Henry
 Simmons now expressing a prospect of being
 releas'd from this place the latter end of next 
 Summer we hope this Subject will be weightily
 impressed on your minds, all which we Submit
 to your Solid deliberation— We are well and are your affectionate
 Friends—Signed &c. 2nd from Thomas Wistar received the 1st of 2nd mo 99 Philadelphia 11th mo 19-98 Dear Friends I wrote to you (I think) some
 time in the last month from Monmouth
 County, New Jersey to which place I had remo-
ved with my Family on account of the aw
ful visitation of Sickness under which many
 of the inhabitants of this City were then labor
ing, and which continued until about the
 5th of this month when it pleased the
 great disposer of events to cause a dispensation
 of more general health—In the course of
 about three months, near three thousand
 five hundred of my fellow Citizens have been
 removed from this Earthly Scene in the City—
and many have ended their lives in the neigh-
boring country: But it is not Philadelphia
 alone that has to mourn her slain, several parts
 of the country adjacent lossed some of their
 most valuable Members—About thirteen
 of the friends who came to the City at the
 usual time of holding the Yearly Meeting were
 by this Disease removed (amongst whom
 were Warner Mifflin & James Emlen two mem
bers of our Committee, Joseph Slone another
 member died some time before whether of
 the prevailing disease I know not) The neighboring Villages particularly those
 on the Delaware were Deep snares in this great
 affliction, of these perhaps Chester and Wilming
ton were most Conspicuous, as in the first
 thirty-seven Persons are said to have died, and
 of the remainder of the inhabitants it is
 also said but five families staid in their Ha-
bitations, the others seeking safety in flight
 which also was generally the case in Wilmington 
 where the mortality was such that three Sisters
 were seen carried at one time in one Cart to their
 Graves—The City of New York was visited at
 the same time in a similar manner tho’ not
 I believe to so great a degree Things being thus afflictingly circumstances
 amongst us, there was no meeting of the Committee
 on Indian Affairs from the 18th of the 8th mo
 untill the 17th of this, when a number of us
 being in unmerritted mercy favourd with ability
 to attend at the usual time & Place, a meeting
 was held, and we should have been pleased
 to have heard from you which has been the case
 but once in an official way since Joshua Sharples 
 & John Pierce left You; for notwithstanding
 our minds have been exercised with the awful
 Scenes about us, yet I believe you have often
 been brought into remembrance, & to have
 have heard at the last meeting of your welfare
 etc. would have afforded satisfaction to all then
 present- The desire I feel that you should from time to time 
 be informed that you live in the remembrance
 of your friends here, more than any qualificati-
on at present experienced for writing, is the
 cause of my addressing you at this time—for tho’ it
 might be possible for my head to dictate & my
 hand to write something that should sound
 agreeable, yet without a correspondent feeling
 of the heart, it would be alas! but as sounding
 Brass— In sincere love in which I
 am joined by my wife I am affectionatly
 your friend, Thomas Wistar -- To Joel Swayne Halliday Jackson & Henry Simmons Fourth Letter to the Committee Genesinguhta3rd mo. 24th 1799
 Dear Friends, Our last letter to you was dated
 the 23rd of the 3rd month last but was delay'd here
 some time before we could get it forwarded to
 Franklin, since which we received a letter from
 Thomas Wistar dated the 19th of 11th mo. 98
 and were thankful to find that the late 
 afflicting dispensation of sickness in your parts
 was in a great measure abated and that you
 were again permitted to meet in your usual
 manner, and altho’ it affected us much that
 so many of our worthy Friends laid down
 their lives in the calamaty, it affords us
 consolation to find that we still live in the rem-
embrance of some of the survivors, altho’ the
 intercourse between you and us is not so fre-
quent as we could desire Our School at Conishadaga grows larger
 and the progress in the Children’s Learning
 affords an encouraging prospect—several
 Grown persons have also evinced some incli
nation to be instructed, and paid some attention
 thereto—The Indians have made proposals
 of assisting us in building a schoolhouse at
 that place, and as our present accommo
dations there are but indifferent we think
 it necessary to carry the work into effect
 pretty early this Spring—Numbers of
 them propose building more comfortable
 Dwellings for themselves the ensuing Summer
 & request our assistance and instruction therein,
 and we are not without a hope that some of them
 will take up farming also, altho’ the want of Do-
mestic animals is a great impediment in
 their way— Five of us have been mostly employ'd in
 Mechanical Business at our Settlement the
 late Winter have prepared Plows and other
 necessary implements of Husbandry, and also
 made a good deal of Cooper ware and other
 Articles which we exchange with they Indians
 for Sugar and other house necessaries— We have lately had some serious considera
tions about taking an Indian Lad as we
 think it may tend to the promotion of
 the work & that he may be useful to us, but
 are willing to submit the matter to you— We are also united in Judgement, that
 if a well-qualified family should offer they
 may be encouraged to come forward this 
 Spring in order to make a more permanent
 settlement at this place, as there is a probabili
ty of our business being a good deal scattered,
 and suitable accommodations will be pro
vided for this reception— Having lately wrote pretty largely to
 you we have little to "alleghany" only that we
 continue to enjoy our health, and that
 you are often feelingly brought into our
 remembrance— We remain your affectionate Friends H.S. J.S. & H.J The following Letter we received from the
 Indians of Cataraugus Village Cataraugus April the 11th To the Allegeny Quakers -- This day we have met with our
 Brothers as opportunity to write a few lines,
 we return thanks to our Maker for our op-
portunity to proceed, our business is to 
 desire our Friends to take it in consideration, we
 desire to get the knowledge of Farming from our
 Friends, as one god made us both, we have advanced
 ourselves but still think fit to embrace opportu
-nity offer'd us by our Friends if we have any
 Gift, that we may have our eyes opened—
We first lay our matter before you our friends
 as you have come forward and offer'd to assist
 in our undertakings, as their is 381 Souls
 in this Village that have agreed to receive
 instructions from you, in all the various
 Branches of learning, letters, pen and till-
ing the Field, as we have seen Great bene
fit by Captain Obeals learning, we desire
 to be instructed in the same Rules— Brothers if you will take into consideration
 to Favor us according to our desire, and
 send such men as you think fit to instruct
 us, they shall have houses and Lands
 to make themselves comfortable and shall
 not be molested by friend, nor foe—but
 be protected according to the best of our abilities. And Brothers, if you conclude to assist us
 in this time of need and necessity we
 desire you would help us to a set of saw
 mill Irons— An we are your friends, Sa os non da Won,two,guh,ta Ti,an,na Se nahc to gura Goo,ty,gont In this year of our Lord 1799 Fifth letter to the Committee 4th mo. 21st 99 Dear Friends, The occasion of our writing
 to you at this time is on account of the en-
clos'd Letter which we received from the Ca-
ttaraugus Indians a few days ago, and after
 due deliberation on the subject, we forward
 it to your consideration, believing there
 is a favorable opening for help profit
ably to be administered to the Indians of that Village, and
 as they are a part of the Seneca Nation to 
 whome our Certificate was addressed; they
 have an Idea that they ought to be partakers
 of the instruction and assistance our society
 have propos'd affording that People— Their present situation is favourable for the
 promotion of civilization amongst them,
 having a reservation of 42 Square Miles situate on
 Cataraugus River adjoining Lake Erie
 and land of a superior quality several hundred
 Acres of which is already clear'd of the tim-
ber—They have several head of horse
 Creatures and a good many Cattle, but
 are very desirous of haveing somebody among
 them to instruct their children, learn
 them the art of Farming and also sup-
ply them with some necessary implements
 to carry on that business which they are
 not able to purchase themselves as we were
 lately informed by one of their chiefs.
 We understand there are several good
 Millseats on their Land: and altho we con-
sider the smallness of our Funds established for 
 the benefit of the Indians we are of the
 Judgment it would be proper to give them
 a little assistance as soon as practicable, all
 which we submit to you—If Friends
 conclude to send them any assistance we
 have thought whether or no such articles as
 they request could not be procur'd in 
 upper Canada at a much cheaper rate than
 taken from Pennsylvania—

 People are lately gone to Pittsburgh

 the Committee Being as follows — Philadelphia 2nd mo. 19th 1799Dear Friends, Feeling our minds solici-
tous on your accounts, which solicitude
 our Ignorance of your situation has
 considerably augmented, not haveing
 received any information from you since your
 letter of the 11th mo. 19th last, which is the second
 we receiv'd since Joshua Sharpless and John
 Pierce left you We are desirous you may be supported
 under any discouragements may present
 owing to the interruption that we appre
hend has happened to our
 correspondence, and that you may be ena-
bled to persevere in the cause we are mutu-
ally engaged in, of which so arduous a task
 has fallen to your lot; a cause which the
 more we are engaged in, and contemplate on 
 the more we are confirm'd in a belief that it
 had its Origin in benevolence and Good will
 to man: and altho’ prosecuted with much dif-
ficulty, labor, and expence, and the advantages
 resulting therefrom as yet observable but few;
 yet we trust as all engaged there in help
 steadily, & patiently to the Single Object,
 we shall in due time experienced it own'd
 and blest with by the Author of all good;
 who we are taught to believe will not suffer
 the Smallest Labor of love to go unrewarded. By information receiv'd from the settlement
 at Oneida we are encouraged to hope considera-
ble progress is makeing there Feeling and sympathizing with you
 as we do, raises in us desires of hearing from
 you as often as opportunity will admit We are affectionately your Friends

 To Joel Swayne 
 Halliday Jackson 
 & Henry Simmons 6th Letter to the Committee 6th mo. 16st 1799 Dear Friends, Since we wrote to you last
 we received your very acceptable letter of the
 2nd mo. 19th last, which is the first we have
 receiv'd from you jointly since our settling here
 – Some weeks since we received a few
 lines from Thomas Wistar & Thomas -
 Howardson, desiring one of us to go to the
 kozy Town for a Yoke of Oxen, which accord-
ingly was done, and explor'd the settlements
 as far as Fort Franklin in quest of a Cow
 but could find none for Sale. The price
 General Wilkins had fix'd on the Oxen was
 one hundred Dollars, but we are now of the
 Judgment 80 Dollars is their full value.
 They are nearly Old enough to turn off We know of no opportunity at present
 of getting a Cow but we hope to avail our
selves of one by some means in the
 course of this Summer – We think
 we have 8 or 9 Acres of our Wilderness bottom
 Clear'd, have got 4 Acres of Corn in the
 Ground, 5 Bushels of Oates sow'd, and 8
 Bushels of Potatoes Planted this Spring
 have also plow'd several small lots
 for the Indians near us and divers of the
 men have assisted in the Labor of the Field.
 One has fenc'd in a farm near us and more
 are about doing it – We have erected a
 commodious Schoolhouse at Conishadago
 which the Indians assisted us in doing,
 and also found materials for it Altho’ we find sufficient encouragement
 to persevere in the work, we cannot but
 lament the evil effects produced by an
 intemperate use of Spirituous Liquors
 amongst those poor people – The procured
 much of it this Spring when out in the
 Frontier Settlements disposing of their
 Skins, Furrs, &c., which has caused us
 some renewed engagement of mind to bear a Testimo
ny 
 against it, and qualification was measurably
 measurably experimented to point out the
 miseries to which they were subjected by it,
 And we are not without a hope that things
 are bettering in that respect We receiv'd intelligence from our Agents
 at Pittsburgh, that the articles you ordered
 would be forwarded to Fort Franklin for us
 one of us therefore propose, starting tomorrow
 with several Canoes and a company of
 Indians in order to transport them
 to our place – We hope the considerati
-on of an addition to our number will
 seriously engage your attention, as another
 of us have a distant prospect of being
 releas'd from this place – We have not the accounts in readiness
 to forward at this time, and think nothing
 will suffer by delaying them untill we
 receive the other Articles – Enjoying our
 health as usual we remain your affectat
 Friends H.S J.S. & H.J 2nd Letter from the Committee received 6 mo. 24th Philadelphia 4th mo. 20th 1799
 Dear Friends, Your letter of 1st mo. 23rd
 was received and read in the Committee for Indian
 affairs at their meeting Last month, its General
 contents affording satisfaction a renewal of that
 general sympathy was felt which frequently
 accompanies our minds on your behalf,
 secluded as you are from the Society you
 have been accustomed to: yet where an evidence
 attends the mind that we are in our proper
 allotments in obedience to him who has a right
 to our Services in such situations and exercises
 of duty as He is pleased to manifest, those
 things which would otherwise be very trying
 and Irksome are made easy – your intimation of a prospect that one of
 you might during the winter season profit
ably reside at the Lower Village to instruct
 the Children in School Learning has
 claimed our serious deliberation, and we 
 are free to suggest that you rather encourage
 some of the Indians to second a few of their Chil-
dren to reside near you in winter – perhaps
 by so doing the school will be smaller, but
 we hope quite as useful to such as do attend
 and afford you more comfort and satisfaction,
 believeing you will strengthen and encourage
 one another and be less exposed by resideing
 as much together as may be – we would
 not wish to be understood as disapproveing
 of the trial already made but feel a solici-
tude for your preservation under the safe
 direction of pure unerring wisdom Enclosed is Invoice of such of the Articles
 you wrote for, as was by the Committee
 concluded to forward – except the three
 Barrels of Flower, and Flax seed, which it
 is expected Abner & Jesse Barker will
 forward with the other articles from
 Pittsburgh – We remain your affection

 To H.J. J.s. H Simmons Tho. Wistar Clerk Seventh Letter to the Committee 8th mo. 22 - 99
 Dear friends We have had no accounts from
 you since your letter of the 4th mo. 13th which
 accompanied the Articles you sent us, all of
 which we received agreeably to the Invoice en
closed. We feel solicitous in the prosecution
 of our present engagement to be preserved under
 the direction of best wisdom, and also to act agree
ably to your council; yet upon serious delibera
tion on the Subject you propos'd of the Indians
 sending their Children to our village to be
 instructed in School Learning we are again
 free to suggest to you that we believe it will
 afford the most general satisfaction, & be most
 advantageous to the Indians for the School
 to be kept at the lower village, while three suita
ble persons are stationed in this quarter, as
 the Children are mostly there and but little
 hopes of them comeing nearer to us – But
 the prospect of one of us returning this Fall will
 probably prevent the School being kept at
 that place the ensuing winter unless their
 is an addition to our member We have lately purchased a Cow which sup-
plies us with plenty of Milk- Our Corn, Potatoes, etc. Looks well, and we
 are preparing Ground to sow several Bushels
 of Winter Grain- Being well in health we have nothing to
 "alleghany" more than we desire to hear from you
 as often as opportunity serves- We remain your affectionate Friends H.S. J.S. & H. Jackson Third letter from the Committee Received 9th mo. 12th 99 Philadelphia 6 mo. 22nd 1799 Dear Friends, Your several Letters of 3 mo. 21 & 4 mo.
 21st haveing been duly received were read in a mee
ting of the Committee and the 18 Ultimate, their
 general contents being acceptable and satisfactory Your prospect of an increasing desire of improvement among the natives, affords encouragement to
 preserve in the task allotted us, though’ in its nature
 arduous, and not unattended with difficulties
 which it is however hoped may prove temporary
 and surmountable Your apparent lively dedication
 to the service before you, mingles a pleasing
 sensation with our sympathy and solicitude for
 you in your remote and exposed situation, accompa
nied with a desire that best support may be your
 experience – Your views extendable to additional
 Bodies of Indians are liberal, & becoming the
 cause we are engaged to promote; --how far we
 can unite therein depends on a due consideration
 of the limited Sphere we act in which respect
 to the amount of Funds to be relied on; - Divine
 approbation if obtained, is no doubt an ample
 ground of dependence; this assurance requires that
 we move under the direction of divine wisdom –
 waiting with patient circumspection for Clear
 openings for the advancement of the work – Experience in Indian affairs concerns evinces what must probably have occurred to your obser-
vation as well as ours, that Indians build large ex-
pectation on very slight grounds; caution is therefore
 requisite, that we may rather exceed than fall short
 of what they may be led to look for at our homes. The school instruction of the Indian youth is
 a desirable object, for which were it convenient,
 their coming to you would seem more satisfactory
 than you dividing to go a distance to them
 for as council and strength appertain to union;
 we wish you as inseparable as the nature of
 the concern will admit Your reasons for
 desiring a discreet Family may be encoura
ged to come and reside at your settlement we
 doubt not are weighty, and the subject is serious
 by before us, tho’ doubts have been suggested,
 whether it may yet be reasonable to invite
 females to so material a change of life at a distance
 so great, till the manners and Customs of the
 Natives become more assimilated to the modes
 and principals of civilized life; while the con-
sideration of this matter is under deliberation 
 with us, would it be amiss for you to look
 round you for some thoughtful well-dispos'd
 elderly Female Native, who may be tractable, &
 willing to be instructed in domestic economy
 the needful affairs of a kitchen etc. Your takeing an Indian Lad to instruct in
 Farming and such other business as he may
 be capable of needs our approbation The Friends who were at Oneida and those
 who went about the same time you left us all
 remain there, and have been favour'd to enjoy
 a good state of health – We have receiv'd sa-
tisfactory accounts from them respecting
 the improvement of some of they Indians, &
 several Lads have undertaken to learn the
 Smiths business In respect to the application of the
 Cataraugus Indians, we may inform you
 the same has received our serious attention
 and deliberation which is intended to be
 Confirmed and the result communicated
 to you – in meantime (as we are desirous
 to supply them with a set of mill Irons)
 enquiry is intended to be made how, and where
 they can be procur'd the most advantageous
 for them, and at the least expense to us But it is of the highest importance to
 the Success of what this people appear to have
 in prospect, that they be constantly and
 closely excited to a sober and diligent
 attention to frugality & economy in hus-
banding the pecuniary means afforded them
 for improvement Signed on behalf of the Committee To H. Jackson. J. Swayne | Thomas Wistar Cl:
 & H. Simmons Eighth Letter to the Committee da. 11 mo. 10 1799
 Dear Friends, The latest written intelligence
 we received from you was your letter of the
 6 month 22nd which came to hand about
 the time and mutually beloved Friends visited 
 us in the 9 mo. last – its general con-
tents being salutary, & encouraging to fur-
ther degrees of dedication in the arduous
 task which now seems to be devolv'd on a
 very small number of us in this quarter: yet
 as we are at home favourd with a renewed
 evidence that the work is sanctioned by
 divine approbation, and that we as instru-
ments engaged therein, and in our proper
 allotments, it has a tendency to sweeten the
 bitter cups, and make hard things easy,
 and withal to hope we shall experience
 strength sufficient unto the Burden of the
 day, and that our labour will not be in vain
 notwithstanding the discouragements that
 at times arise, and the slowness of they
 Indians improvements Several Indians have manifested a disposition
 to work at our business this Fall, which we em-
ploy'd to assist in gathering our Corn & Potatoes
 – of the former we had in all about 200 bushels
 and of the latter about 90, also about 9 bushels
 of buckwheat, but had a difficult time in
 collecting them by reason of much wet
 weather in last month. – We have near four Acres of Wheat & rye
 sow'd which looks well present – We have got a good Smith Shop erected
 and are now about building a Barn which
 we expect to Finish in a few days We have some prospect of teaching several
 small Indians who reside near us, at our
 house the ensuing Winter, and now have
 a more Adult person living with us
 to be instructed in School Learning,
 whose debilitated situation of Body renders
 him incapable of procuring livelihood
 in the common way Haveing some intelligence of the Yellow [fever]
 being again prevalent in Philadelphia
 raises in us desires of hearing from you
 often, either in a collective or individual
 capacity Corn planter : and several of his people proposes going to Philadelphia in the early part of this winter We are well and remain your affectionate
 Friends. J. S H. J 12th month 28thWe received the following Letter

 Got a full understanding of what you wrote in your
 Letter – The instructions you gave pleases us very
 much in general – you may rely upon it that we
 are going to follow your directions, for we have swallow
 it in our breast and heart – Now Brothers we must inform you that we are
 a going to lay up money to buy Cattle and other
 useful articles 250 Dollars, and for the following
 year we mean to lay up as much more – The mill is a going on all agree when we are ready
 we will call on our friends the Quakers, we
 wish you to give us all assistance you can when
 we come to build, so that we don’t give too much
 for our works, our minds are determined to have
 our Brothers, Friends Quakers to oversee – We have fully determined to throw up drink-

 have determined to order them off the Ground Brothers, We hope you will keep your mind strong
 as you was at first, and we return you great
 thanks for the kindness you have done already. Our principal women return you their hearty
 thanks, they understand that their friends

 Company with the one you wrote to Captain
 Obeal, and are glad to find you got a full
 understanding of what our friends wrote to
 you at Buffalo Creek and that the instructions
 they gave you pleases you generally – Now Brothers we did not see that speech
 which our friend left at Buffalo Creek for you
 but as you say you are determined to take their
 advice and have already swallow’d it down in
 your breast, we hope you will often remember 
 and consider it – Brothers, We are glad to hear that you have come
 to a resolution to lay up so much of your money
 in order to buy Cattle and other useful articles
 and that you are determined to quit drinking
 Whisky and not to allow any traders to sell it
 on your Ground – Now Brothers this is a very Wise resolution
 in you, and we hope you will be sincere and
 keep to it – We heartily wish all the Indian Tribes
 would join you in driveing Whisky and Rum out
 of the Land – We hope some of you have got
 your eyes opened to see that Whisky and Strong
 drink has been the Cause of much Evil and wicked-
ness among you, and that it has taken away much
 of your money, your skins, & your furrs, which
 the great Spirit has given you to buy Blankets
 and Clotheing, & oxen, axes and hoes, and other
 useful articles to assist you in tilling the field –
 and we fear in time past it has taken away some
 of the Corn your poor Women have work'd hard
 at raising with their Hoes – Brothers, You must know there are many White 
 People that love money, and they know that you
 love Whisky, and this is the way they take to
 get your money and Property from you, but
 if you keep to your resolution not to drink it
 then there will be no danger, you will then
 have money to buy Oxen and Plows to plow
 your Ground and raise a great deal of Corn, and
 to buy axes and Hoes and other useful Articles to
 go to Farming with, and then when your Brothers
 the Quakers see that you are trying to do good for
 your selves, and makeing good use of your money
 it will encourage them to help you more – Brothers, We desire you often to think upon the
 Great Spirrit, and pray to him in your hearts,
 and then he will shew you what is good, and what
 is evil; and we want you to take up work like
 the White people, for your land we think believe is
 very good and will produce a great deal of Grain if
 you are industrious, and when you get plenty of
 Cattle, and Sheep, and Swine, they will afford you
 plenty of meat, and be much easier taken than
 the Elk, the Deer, & the Bear – Then will your
 Old men, your Wives and your Children be
 happy and enjoy the Comforts of Life, and 
 you can look on your Flocks, your Fields and your
 Fruit Trees, with contentment and Pleasure Brothers and Sisters, We are young men and cannot
 say a great deal to you but we intend to send an account
 how you are comeing on to our Older Brethren in
 Philadelphia and we can assure you they will be
 your Friends and will counsel you wisely in every
 thing for your good, and we hope your ears will always
 be open to Listen to their Talk – We commend you to the Care of the Great Spirit
 and are your Friends and Brothers Joel Swayne

Halliday Jackson Ninth Letter to the Committee 1st mo. 16th 1800 Dear Friends, Our last was dated 11 mo. 10th since
 which we have received no intelligence from you
 either collectively or individually – Our Living here the present Winter is in a good
 degree comfortable and we are encouraged to hope
 we shall experience an addition to our number the
 ensuing Summer whereby one of us may be
 released from the present engagement 
 A Smith would be very desirable and we think ex-
tensively useful at this place – We have kept up a school at our house the present
 Winter where several small children have attended
 and make some progress in learning – and an
 Indian Lad about 13 years of age is now resideing
 with us, whom we have a prospect of keeping to
 instruct in our business – We have lately received a letter from the Indians
 of Cattaraugus Village, who appear to continue
 their prospect of looking toward us for assistance
 and instruction –on serious deliberation on
 the subject we felt easy to write them an answer
 in order to strengthen and encourage them in
 the resolutions the appear to have adopted, a
 copy of which with the letter the sent us is here
 enclosed for your perusal – What ever result
 may take place in the Committee respecting those
 Indians, we are free to suggest, if nothing further
 is attempted for their advancement in civilization,
 whether or no a few Axes & Hoes or such like use-
ful articles; would not be expedient to send among
 them in order to support that Friendship and
 Confidence they appear to have in our Society –
And if the Committee should see cause to afford
 them a few of those useful articles we think if they
 were deposited in our care the Indians would not think
 hard of coming to us for them – In the mean time
 if we should have further intercourse with that people
 we mean to extend our inquiries into their conduct
 and situation, and transmit our knowledge thereof
 to you – A few articles may be necessary to send forward in the
 Spring for our accommodations here, of such as we
 recollect at present is – Chocolate Tea, 2 Bushels
 of fine Salt – a short piece of Strong Cloth – 1 do of strong
 shirten linen, some Candle wick – 1 doz nail Gimblet
 100 Sprigs – 6 plain bits & an Almanack – The Cloth and linen is intended for the accommoda
tion of the Family here – we don’t desire any more
 to traffic with the Indians, and if a Smith should
 come forward some more Tools, Iron & Steele per-
haps will be necessary All which we submit to
 you, and being well in health remain your Affectionate Friends – Joel Swayne 
 Halliday Jackson Received 3 mo. 29 1800 Philadelphia 2 mo. 22 1800
 Dear Friends, Your Letter to the Committee
 on Indian affairs dated 16 Ultimate was
 duly received and afforded much satisfaction
 to find you were preserved in health, and
 that your situation was rendered comfortable
 during the inclemency of the present Season. Various consideration have induced the
 Committee to believe it right to withdraw our
 friends from the Oneida Nation – Several
 of the Indians have been instructed in the
 best mode of tilling their land and two
 or three young men have acquired so much
 knowledge in the Smiths business as to be able
 to do what may be wanted in that line for
 the use of the Nation so that by proper ap-
plication on their part they will be essen-
tially benefitted by the labor bestow'd upon
 them – Jacob Taylor & Jonathon Thomas 
 attended the meeting of the Committee this
 day; neither of them appear to be fully
 releas'd from a prospect of further service
 among the Indians, We are therefore not with
out a hope of the subject being so matured in their 
 minds by the next meeting of the committee as to pro-
duce a willingness to spend some time in your settlement. Your answer to the letter of the Cataraugus Chiefs
 is such a proof of your Guarded care and anxious
 concern for their Good as it could not fail of being
 very satisfactory to the Committee who have
 agreed to forward for their use some hoes and
 Axes together with the Articles for your accom-
modation when convenient opportunity occurs, and
 for your information we enclose a Copy of a
 letter addressed to that tribe by our friends who were
 at your country last Fall – Under a full persuasion that every act of obedience
 is not only noticed but in the lords time
 fully rewarded, we doubt not but your dedicati
on to the very trying duty allotted you will
 (as patience is abode in) be abundantly recom-
pensed, with that peace which surpasseth
 every Temporal acquisition – With desires that you may be favoured with
 the continuance of that divine support
 which hath hitherto been graciously afforded for
 your strength and encouragement we remain
 your affectionate friends 
 Joel Swayne & H Jackson John Elliott Ellis Yarnall 
 on behalf of the committee Copy of an address to the Indians of Cataraugus Village -- 
Brothers, Your Friends the Quakers in Phila-
delphia received a letter which you sent to our
 young men Who live at Genesinguhta on the
 Allegany River in which letter you say you
 want to build a saw Mill and request them
 to help you to get the Irons, and also desire
 some instruction to put you in a better way
 of farming – Brothers we write to you on behalf of
 your friends the Quakers in Philadelphia.
 We have lately been to see our young Men
 at Genesinguhta and our brothers the Indi-
ans whom they are endeavouring to instruct
 in farming, and we were pleased to find that
 some of the Indian men are beginning to help
 their Women to work and raise Corn and make
 fence –We were also at Cataraugus and would
 have been Glad to have seen you, and taken
 you by the hand, but understood you chiefs
 were not at home – We now inform you
 the saw mill Irons are made and on the
 way comeing to be placed under the care of 
 Wm Johnson at Buffalo who will deliver them
 to You when you are ready to build a saw mill
 first informing Halliday Jackson and Joel Swayne 
 our two young men who live at Genesinguhta
 and getting their Order for delivering them to you.
 Brothers we cannot at this time give you any assis-
tance about Farming, but if the men will begin
 to be industrious ( we see your land is very good)
 you may soon raise abundance of Grain and if
 you take our advice in that and leave off drink
ing Whisky, we shall be encouraged to try, to
 instruct you further in farming and work-
ing your land, but if you will spend your
 money that you should buy Cattle and other
 useful things with, for Whisky, we shall be
 discouraged from trying to get our young men
 to come and live with you, and instruct you, for
 we see that bad white men who get drunk do
 very little good for themselves or anybody else. Buffalo 10 mo. 9 – 1799
Signd by Joshua Sharpless Isaac Coates James Cooper Thomas Howardson The following is copied from a Newspaper
 1 mo. 1811 To the Legislature of Virginia The Memorial and Petition of the
 religious society of friends commonly called Quakers
 Respectfully showeth:
 That your Memo-
rialists expanding the high regard with which
 the Legislature will be disposed to consider every
 Subject with which the Legislature will be dis-
posed to consider ever ry affecting the great
 principals of civil and religious liberty beg leave
 to solicit your attention to the militia laws of
 this Commonwealth and to the incompatibility
 which sometimes results between the requisition of
 Law and the obligations of religious duty. For this enlightened age and country and before this
 Legislature your memorialists conceive it unnecessary
 to urge the unalienable rights of conscience as to
 adduce any arguments to show that the relations
 between man and his maker Creator neither can
 nor ought to be prescribed by any human authority.
 It is unnecessary because the preposition is self
 evident and especially because it is one of the fun-
damental principals when which the civil and
 political institutions of this country are
 established. This principal is recognized in the bill of rights
 it is confirmed by the law of 1785 passed in the
 enlightened and liberal spirit of that instrument
 and the state itself by its convention which rati
-fied the federal constitution explicitly declared that “the
 liberty of conscience cannot be canceled or abridged
 restrained or modified by any authority of the U. St. The free exercise of religion therefore is not mere-
-ly tolerated, it is declared in the most solemn
 form; it is confirmed in the most explicit manner. But the liberty of conscience your memorialists
 conceive cannot be restricted to the mere liberty
 of thinking or to the violent and unseen modification
 of religious opinion – Religion has duties to be performed
 and it points out offences to be avoided; its free exercise must
 therefore consist in an active compliance with its
 dictates enforced by no legal compulsion restrained by
 no legal impediment. Your memorialists in common with every virtuous
 citizen would disdain any execution under the colour
 of religious liberty from the universal obligations of
 moral duty but the law of 1789 in making – 
“overt acts” of an injurious nature the limit of the
 privilege and the criterion of its abuse removes all
 danger to the community. An encroachment
 on the rights of other as evolution of the moral
 law under pretence of liberty of conscience would
 immediately betray its own guilt and hypocrisy
 and afford a legitimate cause for the interposition
 of the civil authority. More considerations are suggested as applicable
 to the cause which is now submitted to the wis
-dom and justice of the Legislature. Your memorialists are christians and im-
-pressed with a firm conviction that war
 is forbidden under the Gosple – they cannot
 bear Arms – to require it under legal penalties
 is to reduce them to the alternative of refuseing
 a compliance with the laws of their country
 as of violating what they most solemnly believe
 is to them a law of God, clothed with the most
 awful sanctions Your memorialist plead for no new doctrine
 the set up no novel pretentions. The ask permissi-
-on only to practice the precepts of Jesus Christ.
 To adhere to a principal which prevailed through
 the first centuries of the Christian dispensation
 which pious men through every subsequent age have
 maintained, and which their predecessors from the
 time they have been known as a religious society
 under various forms of Government and through
 suffering imposed by rigorous and persecuting
 laws, have uniformly supported. It is true that in the laps of time the Spirit of
 time - the Spirit of persecution has faded before the
 light of truth. Our own Country as already
 stated has been particularly distinguished for
 maintaining the principals of civility and reli-
-gious liberty and for rejecting those of coercive law
 and religious intolerance. The very grievance
 to which we now solicit your attention has been
 acknowledged and redefined. A Legislature composed
 of 
 enlightened statesmen and sages who had assisted
 in establishing the chartered rights of America
 who had seen the principals which your memorial-
-ists maintain tested through the revolutionary
 war convinced it is believed of their sincerity
 and of the Justice of their claims, exempted the
m from the obligation to bear arms and from
 certain fines and penalties which had been impo-
-sed on their non-compliance with military
 requisitions. But the laws are changed. They
 now require that your memorialists, notwith
-standing their objections of their
 religious scruples should be trained to arms. Their
 refusal subjects them to fines which within certain
 limitations subjects them are fixed at the discretion
 of the Court Martial and become in numerous
 instances extremely oppressive. Nor is this all your
 memorialists conceive that the voluntary payment
 of a fine imposed, for adherence to religious duty or
 the receiving of surplus money arising from the
 sale of their property seized for the satisfying of these
 demands, but would be to acknowledge a delinquen
-cy which they cannot admit and to become parties
 in a traffic or commutation of their principals.
 Hence also considerable loss is sustained. And
 notwithstanding your memorialists may
 acknowledge that many officers in the government
 in these cases manifest great reluctance, and
 execute their trust with a scrupulous regard to
 the interest of the sufferers: yet there are
 others in which wanton depredations are made
 on the property of individuals Your memorialists are aware that it may be said
 that the law does not discriminate between them &
 others and that they ought equally to support the
 public burthens, and yield their services to the exigen-
ces of the state. This objection supposes that a general
 law cannot have a partial or unequal operation.
 It supposes that what may be deemed a nati-
onal concern may supersede the chartered rights &
 and privileges of the people. But your memorialists
 cannot suppose that these principals which indeed
 are no other than the maxims of tyrant will ever
 be deliberately adopted and acted upon by this
 legislature. If one member of the community
 believe that it is duty to fight and to slay the
 enemies of his country, and if another believe
 that he is prohibited by divine command from
 planning the destruction of shedding the blood of
 his fellow creatures, the question as it relates to the
 present subject is not which or whether either is wrong
 but whether a law commanding both to take up
 arms would not operate unequally and violate
 the rites of conscience? It would operate unequal
-ly because it does not discriminate because to
 the conscience of the one it does not enjoin the
 performance of a duty, to that of the other the
 commission of a crime. It would violate the
 liberty of conscience because it would compel
 under pains and penalties the performance of
 an act which is believed offensive to the divine being. Human authority cannot like the Great
 searcher of hearts try the Spirits of men respecting
 truth and error, it cannot remit the penalties
 of sin or controll the convictions of the heart and
 therefore in this country at least the liberty of
 conscience is wisely plac'd beyond the Sphere of
 legislation, and protected from the encroachments
 of any power in the government. It may be recollected too that in every nation
 of the civilized world, where this society is found they
 profess and maintain the same principals, that no
 hope of reward no dread of punishment, not confis-
cations imprisonment or death, would induce them to
 bear arms against this Country, as in any other
 cause whatever and that every attempt to coerce
 them would result on the one side in the Triumph
 of principal however severely tested, and with un-
availing persecution on the other. While it is there
fore evident that the ostensible object of the Law
 or training them to arms - cannot be effective
 and it is presumed from the general notori\e/ty of their
 principals that it is not even expected to be attain
-ed- while your memoriallists believe that the
 principals they hold can in no sence prove
 injurious to the community, and are persua
-ded that this Legislature would disclaim the
 Idea of raising revenue by laws inflicting fines
 on the free exercise of conscience they trust that
 a privilege conferred by the Supreme being and 
 by the highest authority in this Country decla-
red to be sacred and inviolable may be safe-
ly expected from its justice and liberality.
 They therefore respectfully petition that the
 Laws imposing military requisitions and
 penalties for non-compliance may be consi-
-dered as they respect your petitioners and such
 relief afforded as wisdom of the Legislature
 shall deem just and necessary. Signed by order and on behalf of a meeting
