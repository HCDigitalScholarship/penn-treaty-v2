 The following account of visits to these Indian Reservations in Western New York, has been compiled from the accounts kept by Isaac Coates,
Joshua Sharpless and John Pierce of their visits to those Indians in the years 1798 and 1799. It appears that the above named persons were highly
esteemed by their friends in general and they were often appointed on important business in the Friends Society of which they were members. The
Indian Committee procured various articles for the Indians' use in agricultural industry &c which they forwarded to Pittsburg about the time
those Friends start ed who went in 1798. Visit to the Indians in 1798. Philadephia Yearly Meeting's Committee having concluded to make an attempt at
 civilizing some of the Indian Natives on the North Western border of Pennsylvania, residing on the Alleghany river, in the state of New York.
Several of their number visited said Indians, accompanied by their friends, Henry Simmons, Joel Swayne and Halliday Jackson, who went with the
prospect of remaining a while with the Indians to instruct them in cultivating their lands &c. Three of the Committee kep some account of their
travels and experiences in this journey from which the following is compiled. Those three friends were Joshua Sharpless John Pierce and Isaac Coates,
of whom we will speak as Our Travellers. They set out from Chester County the 1st of 5th Mo. 1798. One of them says This day left our habitations
after experiencing a humbling time in parting with our families and connections, and were accompanied from home by Henry Simmons who called on us,
and next day we were met by Haliday Jackson and Joel Swayne, at the house of Abraham Gibbons where we all set out in the afternoon, about 2 o clock;
and after several days fatiguing ride, we arrived at Reese Cadwallider's in Redstone where we rested ourselves and horses about two days. Attended
their meeting and then proceeded on the journey. Let us leave "Our Travellers" while we reflect that in the undeveloped and thinly settled state of
the country at the time they made this visit, such journeys involved an amount of hardship, fatigue, and exposure, of which it is difficult at this
day to form an adequate conception. (1898.) A member of the Indian Committee can now leave Philadelphia in a luxuriously furnished railroad car, and
in less than a day find himself on the Alleghany Indian Reservation. Then his predecessor in the same good work was compelled to ride his horse day
after day over the Mountains for two or three weeks, often with very indiferent lodging and food to reach the same spot. Now let us return to "Our
Travellers, who have ridden through Shippensburg and are taking a view of the houses as they ride through the village of Strasburg, of which there
are perhaps 40 built of squared logs, One says, Shortly after, we began to assend the Blue Mountain an high towering iminence steep and very rockey.
On the 4th assended another Mountain, When we arrived at its summit we had a delightful view of a well improved valley, two or more miles in width, 
with a lofty mountain beyond, Then through Fannetsburg a village of perhaps 30 log houses. Then over Sideling hill, we rode four miles along its
summit, which was very high, but our prospect was not very extensive by reason of some mountains near by on each hand. As we began to descend a noble
view presented as far as the eye could reach, having the Alleghany mountains in full view at 20 or more miles distant. The extensive prospect
between looked like a delightful plain checquered with a few plantations, but when we come to traverse it we found many lofty hills or mountains one
was the steepest hill we have met with since we left home. It is admirable that so many wagons which pass this road should be able to get up it. I
suppose have passed by 20 this day mostly with families going to new countries, a number of them were crowded with children: 17 persons of diferent
discriptions belonged to one. 4th Our Travellers lodged this night at one Hartleys, near the banks of the Juniata, Next day rode through Bedford, a
village containing a number of good stone buildings, They passed on over mountains, crossing streams, through, what we called, the Glades, to the
foot of the Great Alleghany where is some good land, and luxuriant growth of vegetation. The assent of this mountain is better land than any of the
others, being covered with lofty timbers of divers sorts, On top of the highest of these mountains they passed was a fine spring of water. This night
the 5th they lodged in a dutch town called Berlin in Somerset County. 6th We started early this morning with some hopes of reaching a Friends house
this ivining which was very desirable. We all took notice when on the Alleghany's and for many miles this side how very backward the trees were. When
we left home (1st of 5th mo) they were putting out fast and the weather being very warm they made rapid progress. Yet [here] this morning we
remarked that the buds of the Chestnut and White Oak were not formed into leaves so as to make an appearance, yet the same day as we descended from
Chestnut Ridge the trees were all green, It was curious to see such a diference. J.S. says I think there is, at least, in three miles riding two weeks
diference in the seasons. From Chestnut Hill there is one of the most extensive prospects that is to be met with in travelling--. to the North: to
the West: and to the South, I had no doubt but the view was of 50 miles extent. I.C. says When we got to the top of the mountain where we had the
first sight of Pittsburg we soon began to decend the steepest hill I ever saw a wagon road upon, which to me appeared almost impracticable for a
good team to draw an empty wagon up, Nevertheless, the inhabitants say, they frequently go up loaded, When we descended to the bottom we crossed the
beautiful Monongahela, and immediately entered the town. J. Sharpless says, It was the time of the sitting of the Supreme Court when we arrived here
and we had some fears whether we should get accommodations for our-selves and our horses; but having enquired for the best tavern, before we crossed
the river, we were recommended to the Green Tree, where after some hesitation  we were taken in, and found good accommodations. Some discouragement
attended my mind on the way hither, concerning the business we were going on. -- being important and to be transacted among a people of strange
language, in a wilderness country, and under great uncertainty how we should be able to get the goods we have in care, to our desired part: but upon
our arrival here, and being introduced to some for whom we had letters of credit, we met with a very kind reception, and they appeared hearty in
assisting us, and informed us that the goods sent from Philadelphia arrived safely a few days ago, and were in the public storehouse.We had a
satisfactory conference with the deputy Quarter Master, from whom we learned that General Wilkinson had directed him to assist us in forwarding our
goods up the Alleghany to Cornplanters settlement. We also manifested an obliging and attentive disposition relative to the business, and appeared
well satisfied with the object of our visit and promised to have a boat ready tomorrow for the purpose, and kindly offered to introduce us to General
Wilkinson as early in the morning as would be convenient. We next paid attention to procuring such articles of provision as appeared necessary, having
been informed at Redstone that no advantage would be derived from purchasing them in that neighborhood, or any where short of this place, The
following articles were agreed to be necessary and accordingly purchased viz. 4 1/2 bushels of potatoes, 3 " " wheat flour, 2 " " Indian meal, 2 " " "
corn, 3 1/2 " " oats, 1 " " dried apples, 1/2 " " salt, 35 pounds " sugar, 136 " " bacon, 30 " " biscuit, 28 " " cheese, 8 1/2 " " lard. 12 lights of
window glass, 2 sets of irons, 1 pair of pot hooks, 1 small iron kettle, and several other small articles. 11th. Sixth day. This morning in
company with major Craig waited on General Wilkinson at his own house, who received us with much respect, expressed his great satisfaction to see us
on our present errand, and manifested a disposition desirous of contributing both to our encouragement and assistance, He also renewed, in our
presenence, his directions to the aforesaid major Craig, deputy Quarter Master, to forward our goods up the river, and invited us to take dinner with
him, which kindness we acknowledged, but excused our selves, on account of our bus iness. The deputy Quarter Master said it was about 140 miles by
land to Cornplanter's village, but much more by water, -- that it was a good time for them to go, the river being neither too low, nor too high. So
that the prospect of things looks a little more lightsome. About three in the afternoon a boat was in readiness, and the Quarter Master furnishing a
wagon we soon got our goods collected to the water-side, weighed and put on board, amounting in the whole to 4,734 lbs. for which the boatman was to
have twenty shillings per hundred weight for taking up to the settlement, which we afterwards understood from him, was 270 miles by water, He agreed
to set-off in two or three days, estimating it would take eightteen days to reach the settlement. We next attended to providing some necessary
articles of provision to carry with us on horse back. 12th. 1st day About 8 in in the morning several of our number again waited on the
General agreeable to his request of yesterday, and had a satisfactory interview, in which he expressed his good wishes for the success of the cause we
were engaged in, And to encourage the business and assist therein he presented us with the following letters; and when we came away accompanied us
through the guards and respectfully took his leave of us. To Captain Fowler Agent of Quarter Master General, Fort Franklin. Head Quarters,
Pittsburgh. May the 12th 1798. Sir:-- This will be handed to you by Mr. Pierce, of the Society of Friends in Philadelphia who with several associates
is on a visit to the Seneca Nation with views to make some establishment which may prove useful to those people, and interesting to the rights of
humanity. You will be pleased to furnish Mr. Pierce a guide provisions, and any accommodations he may need, charging the occurring expenses to the
proper head. With respect and esteem, I am Sir, Your obedient servant.James Wilkinson. To Cornplanter and the Village Chiefs of the Seneca Nation.
Friends and Brothers, The bearer, one of out beloved men among the people called Quakers, visits you, with several good men from the same Society,
who intend to sit down amongst you, in order to instruct our red brethren in works of usefulness, and to point out to them the path of virtue, which
leads to the blissful mansions of the Great Spirit, the Father of light and life. Brothers, I charge you to take this our beloved man, and his
companions, by the hand, and to treat them with kindness and sincerity. Open your ears and listen to what they say;- open your eyes and follow their
footsteps: then will your old men, your wives, your children, and your children's children live in security, and enjoy the comforts of life; and
the red people, and the white people on this great island, will soon become as one. Brethren and Children, let this admonition sink deep into your
hearts, and may you be blessed with a clear sky, smoothe roads and plentiful harvests to the end of your days. I command yo to the care of the Great
Spirit, and am in heart your friend, James Wilkinson, Commander-in-chief of the troops of the United States. Being now ready to depart, we took leave
of several of the first characters of this place who wished us success, and affectionately bade us farewell. About 9 o clock we left Pittsburgh.
Crossing the Alleghany just opposite the town, we entered a wilderness county, but little inhabited, the settlements not more than two or three years
old, and scarce of provisions for man and horse. We traveled at several stages about 33 miles, having fed at Durkins 18 miles, we got in the evening
to a place called the Double Cabin, a poor house with earthen floor, on which we lodged, wrapped in our blankets, this night, but could get nothing
for our horses: neither pasture, hay, corn nor oats, nor even an enclosure of any kind to secure them, so we tied them to stumps and fed them with
some oats we had with us, and tried to get some sleep on our earthen bed, after having partaken of some of our victuals. 13th. We were stirring
betimes this morning, as our bed was not inviting to indulge nature, and in 7 1/2 miles came to a poor cabin. Here we got some oats for our
horses and let them pick a little in the woods. We found a great change [here also from what it was when] we left Redstone, the season is backward the
leaves just putting out and there is next to no pasture in the woods, that it looks likely our horses will suffer much when we get among the Indians.
We breakfasted on our own provisions, and proceeded 12 miles further, where after feeding our horses, we took dinner in like manner, and got to Fort
Franklin before 4oclock. 14 1/2 miles, 34 since morning, feeling pretty much fatigued. From Pittsburgh to this place travelling is difficult, part
of the roads extremely bad, and accommodations next to intolerable and we sensibly felt the effect of our poor nights lodging. We met with few
houses in this days ride. The country was pretty level except about Sandy Creek. The town of Franklin [now Venago county] is situated close on the
side of French Creek; it contains ten or twelve log houses: they were built under cover of an old fort, which is now demolished, and a new one erected
half a mile lower down the creek just above its junction with the Alleghany River. Two of us waited on Captain Fowler, and presented General
Wilkinson's letter: upon reading which he manifested great respect, and a full disposition to comply with its contents. He kindly invited us to take
breakfast with him in the morning. 14th We breakfasted with the Captain, and got of him, upon credit of General Wilkinson's letter, four bushels of
corn to feed our horses through the wilderness; half a hundred of flour, and two quarts of salt to take to the Indian village. Joseph Johnson, a
surveyor to the Holland Company, who was going to the mouth of the Conewango Creek, within 16 miles of Cornplanter's residence agreed to pilot us
thither, and to procure us another from that place. After dining at the tavern where we put up last evening, we took our departure, being willing to
leave this dear place, having paid three shillings a meal, four shillings for each horse at very coarse hay, fifteen shillings a bushel for corn, and
yesterday fifteen shillings a bushel for oats. We crossed French Creek, and for about twelve miles had a stony road, and through a poor country, when
we came to a rich bottom on a small stream, where we found plenty of pasture, being the first we had seen in the woods since we left home, About six
miles we came to a house near Oil Creek, the second we have seen since leaving Franklin. This is the most desirable spot we have seen for many miles
back - a fine fertile bottom on the creek with suitable plough land, a large stream not far distant, and a noble spring just by the door, large enough
to turn a mill. Here we put up for the night, and with some concern turned our horses loose to pasture in the woods without any enclosure, for the
first time since leaving home. We lodged pretty comfortably on our blankets. Oil Creek is so termed from an oily fluid, collected from its surface,
arrising either from springs near its margin, or from diferent parts of the creek, It is called Seneca oil, [because] it resembles the Seneca or
British oil in smell. We were informed that one man gathered three barrels last year which sold at Pittsburgh for four dollars per gallon. A year or
two later when Isaac Coates again passed through this section of the country, he speaks of there being a great improvement at this place. A young man
by the name of Titus, had purchased 400 acres of land, the most of it rich bottom, He had then about 36 acres of excellent corn in the ground, and a
considerable quantity of wheat in stock, A large spring of excellent water near the door, large enough to turn a breast mill, That upon the whole I
think his farm likely in time to be of most inestimable value. He says the oil which was collected from the surface of the waters, was principally
valued for medicinal purposes, and had long been used in that way by the Indians. He then had no idea of the wonderful changes which would be
effected in it by the sinking of oil wells, and the consequent enormous developement of the production and trade in petroleum. Now let us return to
"Our Travellers" who left this desirable place the next morning which was white with frost tho' it was the 15th of 5th month. Set off for Broken
Straw, a large stream of water. After riding two miles we entered a white pine forest, where the Holland Company has a saw mill, and is erecting
a grist mill, tho' there are but few houses within twenty miles.* * but people came there 20, 25, or more miles with bags of grain on a horse, to be
ground, there being no road that any carriage can pass; Indeed to those who have not seen these mountainous new countries it would appear
impracticable to pass with a single horse. This is the first pine woods worth noticing since we crossed the mountains, To this place there is a cut
road from Pittsburg, but we now enter the wilderness where a number of marked trees were to be our guides. Our journey this day was truly wild and
romantic, and a tedious day's ride; sometimes we had a blind path and sometimes none; indeed our way for badness almost surpasses description. To
delineate the bushes, logs, trees, stones, roots, and bogs through and over which we passed would require great ingenuity. The woods were very
thick, with much underbrush and a succession of logs to cross some of which we jumped our horses over, and others with difficulty we got round; in
other places we were in frequent danger of getting our horses legs fast or broken in the cavities between the rocks; and sometimes had to
descend banks almost perpendicular into swamps, in which we found the roots of the firs and hemlocks very troublesome travelling over. This stage
called twenty four miles, appeared to us very long taking (12) twelve hours to get through, and for twenty miles of the way there was not one house.
The rocks, stones, old logs and the whole surface of the ground under the forest of pine trees, were covered with moss, resembling for thickness a
fleece of wool. Some of the large rocks more than 12 feet high, having received seed from the neighboring trees, which sprouted and took root, have
large trees of two or three feet over growing on them, Three or four such trees we have seen growing on one rock, with their roots spread down its
sides ten or more feet, untill they enter the ground and have grown firm therein, so that the sides of the rocks were bound with them, like so many 
large ropes or cables. I think we saw no improvement for 20 miles. We arrived at Broken Straw Creek in the evening, where we found plenty of pasture
for our horses, and a cabin the owner of which kindly let us have quarters, After partaking of our own provision, we lay on the floor to take rest,
but the night being cold and the cabin open, we often had to use and renew our fire. 16th Rode seven miles down the east side of Broken Straw to the
Alleghany river. The bottoms on the creek were rich and beautifully coated with a luxurient vegetation. We passed several sugar camps, where the
Indi ans come in the season to make the maple sugar though more than twenty miles from their village. But having plenty of good canoes they convey
with facility their kettles and implements for making sugar, down the river and up this creek to the camps. About noon we arrived at
Conewango, eighteen miles from Cornplanter's: and the road being very rough, we agreed to remain here till morning, there being a good house to
accommodate us, though we had to find our own provisions and sleep again on the floor. Near the mouth of the creek on a beautiful dry place the
State of Pennsylvania has laid out Warrentown. [now county seat of Warren County.] The Holland Company have built a good house in this town where they
keep a store to supply their surveyors and settlers on the land with provisions, &c. [but their's is the only house in the town] Joseph Johnson our
pilot had the charge of this store. Here we met with twenty or more Indians, many of whom were drunk, having obtained liquor of some settlers who
were at this house intending in a few days to go up the creek. Joseph Johnson immediately put a stop to the selling of liquor, and informed us that he
and his men had abstained from the use of distilled spirits in their surveying business, last summer, as was the practice of other surveyors in the
Company's employ, and found they were better without it. He agreed with a young Indian who was sober and we were informed would not get drunk to pilot
us tomorrow to Cornplanter's village. He was a good countenanced lad, and appeared pleased with the charge assigned him, 17th. Set out with our
Indian guide, who could not speak or understand English that we know, and after riding about four miles in which we crossed the Conewango, we had a
rough mountainous country, the road being better calculated for an Indian path, than riding on horse back, being much obstructed by wind-fallen
Timber, and the young growth being* * so thick that if we were two sods apart we would have to call out to each other, in fear of being lost. When we
reached the river we stopped to let out horses eat grass, there being plenty of it on some of the bottoms, which was a pleasing sight, and tended to
remove some fears respecting the fare of our horses, when we got among the Indians, While here a number of Indians came by in canoes, who stopped to
see us, shook hands with us and looked pleasant. One man came down from the mountain with a large turkey on his back, which he had just shot, and we
thought it would have weighed more than twenty pounds, It conveyed the idea that small game was plenty, among them and maybe we would come in for a
share, One of the canoes had a quantity of fine fish, but we found when among them that a turkey, or any other small came was very seldom taken: it
was rare to see a squirrel in the wilderness. We saw some pheasants but no partridges. After a short conference on the weighty business, we were
embarked in, we proceeded up the river, not without some exercise of mind, and would have been glad, could we have sent a messenger forward to
inform the Chiefs of our coming, but this was out of our power, for none of the Indians we met with could talk English: we therefore moved forward
with our minds attentive to best directions. When we came in sight of the town, many Indians appeared in view looking toward us. Our guide turned into
the first cabin he came to, and would go no further, but pointed to Cornplanter's house. We paid him one dollar, and moved forward, and presently
saw the Chiefs coming toward us: and on our riding up and alighting, they appeared to welcome us with open countenances. We did not know
Cornplanter, nor could we distinguish him by his dress, but shaking hands with one who stood foremost, we asked if he was Cornplanter. He informed
us in his way that he was. After shaking hands with all, we were invited to his house, which differed from others only in being larger. We took the
saddles off our horses, carried in our baggage, and being seated, Cornplanter, his son Henry, and several others came in and sat down. This son Henry
had an English education in and about Philadelphia, and interpreted for us. His father can neither speak nor understand English. The Chief presently
asked if we would like to see his people in general Council. We let him know we would as soon as was convenient. Ten o'clock tomorrow was therefore
fix upon, and runners dispatched immediately to give notice. It was about two o'clock when we arrived and some time after the conference
Cornplanter came into our apartment, and asked if we could eat in the Indian way. We replied we expected we could; and presently he brought in some
dinner in a bark bowl and a tin kettle. The bowl was placed on a seat beside us, and the kettle on the ground before us, and we unvited to eat. What
was in the bowl or kettle we knew not, or whether they were to be eaten together or separate. The bowl contained a number of round lumps of something
tied in corn husks, with a string at each end, and one in the middle. At length after some interrogations among our selves, we let them know that our
ignorance was such, we did not know how to begin, which set some of the young Indians laughing. The Chief took out his knife, for they had set 
neither, knives, forks, nor spoons, and taking up a dumpling he cut it in two; then stripping up the husk, he cut off a piece, and dipping it in the
kettle, which we found contained bear's oil he ate it: we followed his example, and made a light meal, the bear's oil was old and not grate ful to our
palate. We have since seen that this way of eating is often practiced among them; though cold Indian bread is more frequently used. The name of this
village is Jenuchshedago, It is situated on the Alleghany in Pennsylvania about four miles below the New York line. The land is Cornplanter's
private property: he has 660 acres in this tract and two contiguous islands, one 66 and the other 53 acres, besides a tract of 303 acres
below Franklin. His land at Hickorytown between here and Franklin he has sold to Dr. Wilkins, Most of the Indians under his particular
superintendence have left their old settlement about 9 miles up the river in New York State, and are settled with their Chief in this place. 18th
Last evening after we had lain down, the Chief and his son came into our apartment, and informed us he would like to know what we intended to say to
his people before the council met. We told him we would inform him in the morning, which we now complied with, letting him know we could not tell them
all we might say as we believed on such occasions it was right to wait on the Great Spirit to be directed: but that we would read to him the
certificate sent by our Committee, which particularly pointed out our business, also General Wilkinson's letter - with which he appeared satisfied,
His son Henry interpreted for us on all occasions: but he was not very ready, and we believed our business suffered on that account. About 12 o'clock
between 30 and 40 of their principal men met in council, which Cornp lanter opened by a short speech expressing the satisfaction he felt on seeing us
coming riding through the bushes, and that it was the Good Spirit which preserved us on our long journey, for which they were glad. He then informed
us of their poverty, and the poorness of their houses, being covered with bark, and their inability to build good ones. We thought the later part of
the speech was calculated to draw on our charity. He then staited that all were met who were likely to attend - that the women could not come, but the
men would inform them what we said -, we having particularly requested the women might attend. We now as at some other times, felt our minds
humblingly impressed with the weight of the business we were engaged in; and after a short but serious pause on our part, we mentioned the love which
their old friends the Quakers have for them, and that we had been made willing to leave our beloved families and comfortable dwellings, and expose our
selves to the hardships and difficulties of a tedious journey, with no other views than for their improvement. We first read, by paragraphs, the
epistle from the Committee, and then General Wilkinson's letter, which were interpreted with some difficulty. We desired them when they took
our proposals into consideration, they would guard against discouragements that might present in looking forward towards a change in their manner of
being. We did not doubt there might be difficulties in the way, and their progress might be slow, yet there are accounts of white people beyond the
great waters, in another island, who many years ago, lived much like they do now, but by industry and care have become good farmers, and
mechanics of all kinds: and from whom those fine leggings, and other clothing they had on, were procured. We then let them know that we had a
boat coming up the Alleghany river, with various kinds of goods - plough-irons, hoes, axes, spades and shovels; with carpenters' masons, and coopers
tools, which we intended never to take away. While our young men stay, they should be placed under their care to lend out to them as they wanted, and
when done with, were to be returned. They were exorted to stillness and quietude and an attention to the Good Spirit in their own hearts. Upon letting
them know we had nothing more to say amongst them at this time, they informed us they would take our proposals into consideration, and give us an
answer tomorrow. We may close our observations on this council by an humble acknowledgement that notwithstanding we find some things tryingly
gloomy, and discouraging, yet we have had at this time, renewed cause to believe, that the concern in which we are engaged, is owned by Him whose
regard is toward all the workmanship of his hands. 19th. 7 day. Part of this day some of our company were employed in baking bread, and other
domestic preparations, as we are now wholly on our own cooks &c. living on the provisions which we brought on our horses from Pittsburgh and
Franklin, and which we have sometimes looked upon, with some serious thoughtfulness, as appearing a scanty allowance for the time set for the
arrival of our boat, and the more especially as Cornplanter early informed us that they were scarce of corn, occasioned by an uncommon freshet
sometime after the corn was planted, and by an early frost in the fall; but our anxiety on this account is now much removed, by Cornplanter informing
us that he had several barrels of flour which he brought from Pittsburgh, and that when we were out of flour he would supply us. We agreed with
his sister for 2 qts of milk per day at 8 cts per qt. we would like to have had 3 qts but 2 was all she could spare. The Indians being most of
this day steadily in private council concerning the business we had laid before them, several times sent their deputies to us for explanations. One
question was, how they should draw their ploughs seeing they had no oxen, and were so poor they had no money to buy them with. We replied we had seen
two horses running about their town, and they were sufficient to draw one plough, and if they would save some of the money which they received, each
year, from the white people, they could buy a pair of oxen, and they could drawn another; and our young men would assist them with their horses
sometimes, and these would do to make a beginning. We told them we did not expect great things to be done all at once, but we wanted them to make a
start, and come on by degrees as they were able. With this answer they appeared pretty well satisfied, though we thought it was not such an one, as
the question was artfully designed to draw from us. At another time they told us, we must wait with patience for an answer, for it was a great thing
and they were all consulting about it in their houses. About 5 o'clock they informed us they were nearly ready, and wished to know if it would suit
us this evening. We answered that we were waiting their time, but as the day was far spent, left it with them to judge whether this evening would be
suitable. About 6 o'clock thirty of them met us in public council. The opportunity seemed to be owned, a degree of solemnity attending. After a short
pause Cornplanter and his son Henry stood up and opened the council. The following is the substance of his speech. Brothers the Quakers. Listen now
to what I am going to say to you, You know brothers the red people are poor, they are not like white people. The Great Spirit has made them of
another language, so that it is very hard for us to understand one another plainly, as there is no person here that can interpret very well. It may be
well here to remark, though not as a part of either of the accounts in hand, that the wealth of some, is a reward, not only of their honesty and 
persevering industry, but also of their economy and endeavors to save their earnings as much as may be; only spending their money for useful
and necessary things. Then when they see a friend or brother in need, and it seems right to help him, they have the means to contribute to his relief.
Brothers, We take great pains to settle the proposals you made to us, but we differ in opinion, and we must take great pains to have everything
complete. Brothers, We suppose the reason you came here was to help poor Indians some way or other; and you wish the chiefs to tell their warriors not
to go on so bad as they have done: and you wish us to take up work like the white people. Now, brothers some of our sober men will take up work, and
do as you say, and if they do well then will your young men stay longer: but some others will not mind what you say. Brothers, We can't say a word
against you. It is the best way to call Quakers, brothers, You never wished our lands, - you never wished any part of our lands, therefore we are
determined to try to learn your ways: and those young men may stay here two years to try; by that time we shall know whether Robert Morris will leave
us any land, and whether he will pay us our money; for last summer we sold our land and we don't know yet whether we shall get what we reserved: but
by that time we shall know, and then if they like it, and we like it, your young men may stay longer. Brothers, If your young men stay here we want
them to learn our children to read and write. Brothers, Two of you are going home again: if they hear anything about out land or money they must 
write to these young men here: and they must tell us if were are like to be cheated. Brothers, This is all I got to say at present. After they had
closed this speech we informed them, that we understood what they had said to us, and that we were satisfied with it: and proposed that our young
men must have some place to live in, and a piece of land to work, in order to set them an example, and to raise bread for themselves to eat, but that
the land should still be theirs, and all the improvements which we should put on it, would also be theirs when we left it; and in order to know where
it would be best for our young men to settle and make a beginning we must look a little about the country, and go to their upper town, and we desired
some of their Chiefs might go along with us, and help to agree on some suitable place, where our friends could be of most use to their people in
general, to which they readily agreed. He next informed that we had a number of farming and other utensils, coming up in a boat which were intended
for their use, and would be left with with them and never be taken away again, but that we thought it best and most for their good, to leave them
particularly under our friends care, and not to give them away at present, but only to lead them that they might have the use of them: for they knew
that some of their young men were not so good as they ought to be; and if these things were divided amongst them, some might pawn them away for
whisky, and then they would be as bad off as they were before they got them. At this observation some of the old men and Chiefs appeared to express
their approbation; whilst some of their young men manifested their sensibility of its truthfulness, by a shamefaced good humored laugh. After which
Cornplanter expressed, a few words indicating his satisfaction with what had been said, and that we would now shake hands as brothers, and directed
his people to rise and come to us, and shake hands by course, himself first setting the example. Thus this Council ended after letting them know that
we should want one more general Council with them before we left them. 20th First day. We had some conversation this morning about sitting together
in religious retirement, and thought it would be right to inform Cornplanter, that if he or any of his sober people inclined to sit with us, it
would be acceptable, though the prospect of such an undertaking felt weighty. Before we were fully concluded, the Chief with his son Henry came into
our apartment and said, he hoped we would not think hard of their not keeping the First day as the whites do, for they could not read or right -
that they were poor, and had to work on that day, and that they were often out hunting and had to attend to their game. We let him know that we
did not think hard of him about this matter; and then informed him that we intended about 10 o'clock to sit down together in stillness to wait on the
Great Spirit, and if he or any of his sober people would come and sit with us it would be acceptable. Near the time appointed, Cornplanter with
several others came into our apartment. He sat very still with apparent solidity until the opportunity closed: the others sat quiet a while and then
withdrew. Our door being opened, the Indians as they passed looked at us, but showed no lightness. 21st Rose early this morning to bake some bread
that we might be in readiness by 7 o'clock to go up the river about ten miles with some of the Chiefs to see where is would be most suitable to
settle and make a beginning amongst them. We found it trying, rightly to judge what was best to do on the occasion. Jenescatego, the town where we now
are being the place of Cornplanter's residence, is in the middle of a good spot of land in Pennsylvania, on the west side of the Alleghany river, 4 or
5 miles south of the New York line. The tract is his private property, as before mentioned, and most of the Indians under his superintendency live
on and near it, among whom are children enough suitable to make up a large school. These considerations, with the richness of the land made it
desirable to settle here. But the land was Cornplanters, and if we made improvements on the Indians clearings they would belong to Cornplanter and
not to the Nation when we left them," All this being considered we concluded it would be best to look elsewhere. The Nation owns forty-two square
miles on this river, beginning at the Pennsylvania line. The lines of the reservation had not yet been run, but we found that the Indians had a choice
that it should lie on the river, half a mile wide on each side. About nine miles from hence up the river, latterly stood a town, called Genesinguhta,
the inhabitants of which a few years since, mostly removed here. About ten miles further up the river we understood a settlement had lately been made.
From the best information we could get we thought somewhere near the Old Town would be the most suitable place to fix on, it being [about] half
way between the upper settlement and the lower town. With considerable exertion we got Cornplanter his son and three other Indians, to embark with us
five in a canoe, about nine o'clock. They put us up the river with setting poles at the rate of three miles an hour, In places the river was
shallow and rapid, in others from two to six feet deep, in six miles we came to Cornplanter's saw-mill, and stopped, at his request, to view it. The
stream on which it is built, is now so low that the mill could do very little work: and when the river is high the back water prevents it from
sawing. At the Old Town, three miles further up there yet remain three or four families. About 150 acres of flat land have been mostly cleared and
worked with corn, part of which is again grown up with hazel &c, and part with grass that in a few weeks would do to mow. Some of the richest spots
are put in with corn this spring. It lies on the northwest side of the river: the flat is about forty perches wide, and then commences timberland,
mostly white pine, suitable for building or rail timber. That within sixty perches of the flat we thought pretty good. It lies very well to the sun,
and is clear of stones. Upon viewing it, and its local situation, we were united in believing, that somewhere near this place would be the best to
make our settlement, and fixed on a spot near the old village, which is in New York State about 4 miles above the Pennsylvania line. After we had
come to this conclusion amongst ourselves, we informed Cornplanter and those with him, that we thought across the upper end of the cleared flat from
the river back taking in a part of the wood land would be suitable for our purpose, and desiring that is they liked it, they would tell us so, and if
they did not like the place we proposed, we hoped they would be plain with us, and let us know, and we would look further, and wished them to propose
a place they should like better, To which Cornplanter returned answer in substance as follows. Brothers, I told you our land is before you, you may
choose any place you like best, and expressed their full approbation of our choice. Then said this man, (meaning one of the Chiefs who was with us)
lives in this town, and he is most like yourselves, a sober man and drinks no whisky: he is very glad your young men are going to live so near him.
We next proposed that our young men should have liberty to cut trees out of their wood, to build a house, make rails, and for firewood &c to which he
replied O, yes! I wish you would cut all the trees down, and an other thing you may have, brothers, if you see a deer swimming across the river, or
running in the woods you may shoot him, or if you see any fish in the river you may catch him. About 5 o'clock we left the old village and
returned with Cornplanter to our lodgings at his house. 22nd. This morning took up the consideration of what further propositions, might with
propriety be made to these people, in order for their additional encouragement in civilization and agriculture, and being favored to write with
what seemed expedient they were committed to writing, in readiness for our next council, in the minutes of which they will appear. We were this day
as well as at some other times pretty closely interrogated about Robert Morris of Philadelphia. Cornplanter and other Indians here having heard that
he was in jail, appeared to be somewhat alarmed lest they should loose their money, as well as land, which we under stand they parted with, with some
reluctance. They had likewise heard that the land was not purchased for Morris as they expected, but for some others whom they called the Holland
people. With these things they appeared much disturbed, as apprehending they are altogether deceived and cheated, and even go so far as to declare
if they cannot have justice done there, they will not receive their money. We felt cautious of giving a sentiment, on this business, not being
fully acquainted with it, and would have put it off by referring them to Captain Chapin, as much better acquainted with it than we were, and to whom
Cornplanter and his son expected shortly to go, on this or some other concern; but with this reference Cornplanter did not appear fully satisfied,
remarking that Captain C. had told him that Morris was a very good and honest man, and yet he was got into jail, now he could not understand how a
good and honest man could get into jail, however he said he intended to ask Capt. Chapin where his good and honest man Morris was now. We were at
length easy to observe to them in general terms, that it was not the advise of their brothers the Quakers, to sell their land, for we would rather
they would rather they would keep it and learn to work it themselves, but as it was now sold, and we thought they could not get it back again, we were
of the mind they had better take their money which we apprehended was, or would be, made secure for them, and endeavor to be as contented as they
could about it. This evening Cornplanter presented us with a quantity of seed corn of diferent kinds suitable to the climate, some seed potatoes, a
large proportion of beans of divers kinds, & a variety of useful garden seeds, such as pumpkin, cucumber, watermelon, &c. These he informed us were a
collection brought in by his people and given to us as a blessing to begin with, we acknowledge their kindness and would have taken only a part, there
being much more of each kind, excepting potatoes, than we should stand in need of for seed, but they insisted we should take the whole, for they were
sent in for that purpose: which we then did; thinking the hearty good will with which they were presented, manifested a full approbation of our
undertaking. 23rd. The forepart of this day some of our company were engaged in writing and arranging our business, whilst others were employed in
preparing for our removal up to Genesinguhta having agreed, last evening, with Henry O'Neal to go with us and be our interpreter. We have had a pretty
comfortable house much to ourselves. Cornplanter has two houses about ten feet apart though roofed over between as the other parts of the house with
bark. The space between serves for an entry, a place to pound their corn, put their weed, &c. There is a door in each apartment opens into this
entry. The room assigned us is thirty feet long the other 24 ft, each sixteen feet wide. They are built of round poles, set in close together by
notches near the end; not chunked or plastered between, so that we found our end pretty open and cold enough before morning. Upon our telling
the Chief they had better make their houses tighter by plastering up the cracks, he replied, if they made their houses too warm, they would not like
to leave them when winter came to go a hunting. along each side of the apartments from the door to the other end, were berths about four feet
wide and one foot high, covered with boards; on these these deer skins are spread - these are their beds, and they make a pretty good seat always
ready. Over these, about five feet high, are placed shelves of the same width which serves to put their kitchen furniture, corn, &c. upon. The fire is
built on the ground, in the middle of the room, the part between the berths not being floored; and there is a large opening left in the top of the
roof for the smoke to escape. As far as I have observed this description answers, for the other houses, though they are not so large, being about
twelve or fifteen feet square with a shed before the door: and there are about thirty in this village and a number above and below the town. They are
beautifully sit uated on the west side of the river, which is about 150 yards wide, and glides before the town with a gentle current. Its bank is low,
and gradually ascends to the houses, which are mostly within six or seven perches, so that they can readily supply themselves with water, there
being no springs in the flat where the town stands. The land is a sandy loam, easily tilled, and if properly managed would be very productive. Fifty
or sixty acres adjoining the town nearly cleared, is chiefly put in yearly with corn, beans and potatoes, and the work is done by the women with hoes.
They hoe the grass and weeds clean from the old cornhills and plant in the same place, and some time after the corn comes up they hoe all the surface
of the field over so that it looks very neat, with the corn they plant beans, squashes, and potatoes, also pumpkins. Since we came here the women
have worked very hard: they found all the corn for hominy and bread, sift and prepare it; cut and split all their wood and and carry it home on their
backs, nearly a quarter of a mile; make all their fires, and do all their kitchen work; plant and take care of, and gather their corn and beans: and
as far as I can learn (says J.S.) do all other out door work, except building the houses and splitting the rails that the corn land is fenced with. It
has been a busy time since we came here, the women have risen early, gone out to the corn field with their hoes, some of them old gray headed women,
and some children (girls) of 8, 10, or 12 years of age and kept pretty close to their work. One old woman who has had her feet so frozen that she goes
altogether on her knees, I have seen carrying in wood and making the fire, bring up water from the river, and go out to the cornfield, and return in
the evening with the laborers, while the men and boys are spending their time in idleness, or shooting with their bows and arrows at a mark, a very
common recreation with them, pitching quails, jumping, playing at some kind of games, and on musical instruments. I have not while in this village
seen either man or boy at any kind of work. It was unnatural, and to me grievous, to see little girls and old women working hard, while boys of 12,
14, or 16 years of age just by them, all day, were doing nothing but playing. At seasons the men hunt and fish, and they work the canoe, at which they
are very expert; but at this season there is very little game brought in; they also catch a few fish; little however was done at this while we were
there. They live poor; their chief subsistence at this season was corn, beans, and bear's oil, prepared in diferent ways. From my observations they
eat much less than we do - a small piece of bread, or dumpling dipped in oil, seems to satisfy nature: and their stated meals I thought were not
more than two a day. The visits of their friends are not interrupted by cooking, or much ceremony in laying the table, If the hominy is boiled,
which was generally the case after eleven o clock, and it was not material whether cold or warm, when their acquaintances came in, the berths always
made a ready seat, on which they were soon engaged in smoking and talking; and while thus employed, a kettle of hominy with a large wooden spoon is
brought in, and set on the ground before them. He that is near it lays by his pipe and in a few minutes appears to be satisfied with his repast, and
moves it over to the next, the rest of the company being engaged as if no victuals were near them. Thus the kettle passes round in a little time, and
when done with, is hung up untill somebody else comes in. If they have no hominy the bread and dumpling goes round in like manner. Their clothing is
generally something tawdry, - callico shirt, and hand kerchief of gay colors, blue coat and scarlet leggings and a belt of various colors,
ornamented with beads, girt round the middle and knees, with the ends hanging down, They are also fond of trinkets suspended from their ears and
nose, the men particularly, sometimes weighing an ounce, and hanging over the mouth. The womens ears are cut round and loaded with diferent toys,
until they are drawn down several inches. One man had two small brass padlocks in one ear, another a toy watch, Large, silver crosses are also
worn by them in the same manner. They are far from being clean in their persons; Some of their shirts do not appear to have ever been washed, and 
about the shoulders they become black and greesy; Their hair I observe to be their cloth to wipe their fingers in while eating their bread and oil. I
thought the women were particularly dirty perhaps from working harder than the men, and being more among the grease. For more than two weeks past, the
weather has been very dry, part of the time a cold north wind, during which time we slept in open cabins in our blankets, so that we felt the want of
more covering and a better bed, there being frost-two mornings. But for two or three days past the weather has been warm, with a strong south wind.
During this dry weather the woods have been much on fire, clouds of smoke frequently covering us so that the sun was obscured. In the night one of
the hills our rather mountains, where a great quantity of dead timber had taken fire, presented a very luminous and striking appearance, as if the
whole mountain was on fire. We have been under some exercise on account of our goods, the river having fallen very fast in consequence of the dry
weather; but in the midst of our trials we have still been favored, a considerable of rain fell last evening though no diference appears yet in the
river. As above stated, we agreed with Henry O'Neal last evening to go with us to Genesinguhta to be our interpreter. It is now 11 o'clock, yet
neither he nor his fathers family have gotten their breakfast, though we have been hurrying him for two hours past. About 12 o'clock two of us set
off on horse back, the other three having started an hour sooner with our baggage accompanied by Henry O'Neal. We rode across the river one mile above
the town, and went up the east side of it to the shore opposite the place of destination where we again crossed, though the stream was wide and deep.
We stopped at the house of a chief who went with us to our intended settlement, getting there about 3 in the afternoon, where we met with our friends
who came up in a canoe. We viewed an empty house that stood near our settlements, but not liking it, we proceeded to look further. There was one
occupied by a family, who we understood proposed leaving it, and would sell their right. The woman who owned it was willing to part with the house,
but having put in a few spots of corn and vines, the whole not more than three or four perch square, she appeared unwilling to give them up, and
they were so in our way, the we thought we had better look elsewhere for our settlement. On the Chiefs confering with her, she was willing to part
with all but one of her garden patches, and it was not much in our way, so we agreed for the house, and its belongings excepting the one lot of corn
aforesaid, which was reserved to her the present year, and understanding that she was a sober woman, and would be likely to make good use of her
money, we paid it all at once which was $20, and she relinquished all claim thereto. With our assistance and the help of some Indian children, she
moved right out, and we took up possession, cleaned out the house, got our provision and other baggage in, and before dark our scanty furniture
was arranged, and we took up our lodging here for the night. The Indian Chief sent us three deerskins with the hair on for our beds, but the night
being cold we sensibly felt the want of better, and of more bedding, before morning, and were under the necessity of using several times to renew our
fire. Our house is about 24 feet long by 19 wide, and 6 high to the square, covered with bark, with a shed over the door, and furnished within, as is
usual in Indian buildings. It stands on an elevated spot, with in five perches of the river on its northeast side. 5 day 24th. This morning our young
men set to work, on their lot having borrowed some tools of Cornplanter, they got a piece of ground, cleared of rubbish, and dug up for a garden,
and our potatoes planted that the Indians gave us, also prepared some ground for the reception of other seeds, when they were stopped by rain which
continued at intervals for most of this day. About 11 o'clock we felt our minds engaged to draw into our new habitation, and sit down together for
religious retirement: in which we were favored with the renewed extendings of divine regard to the contriting of our spirits and strengthening of our
minds, in the work in which we are embarked, and we trust it was a time to be encouragingly remembered by our friends when we are separated from them.
We now sensibly feel the want of our goods, which we cannot look for in less than a week from this time, the season for planting corn being fully
come, we are in some doubts of getting much of that valuable article in, so as to answer a good purpose the present year: Our young men propose having
a piece of ground cleared, and in readiness for the plough against the arrival of our boat, that no time may be lost with respect to getting in as
much of this grain as our circumstances will admit. This evening our young men endeavored to catch eels, but their canoe upset, and they caught a
ducking. Their household utensils were 5 tins, three spoons, a camp kettle, and a small frying pan, borrowed from the Indians. They wanted dishcloths,
towels, soap, and something to knead brid in. They say, When we fry our meat or our fritters, we have neither dish nor plate to put them on, so we use
bark dishes. Our bacon was nearly gone and our cheese quite. A little flour left that we brought from Franklin with chocolate and sugar are our chief
dependence as food. We have received some sugar of the Indians as a present, and some we purchased of the Indians at 1s. 6d. per lb. (18 3/4 cts)
which we find a pretty good substitute for butter and cheese, by taking a bite of sugar (it was in hard cakes) with our bread, there was no cow in
this settlement. The rain to day convinced us that our house was not proof against storms. 25th 6th day Still rainy, so that very little was done at
our clearing. One of our young men was employed in baking bread and some others of our company in writing, plastering up the holes in our house, and 
so forth. We have had very little rain since we left home till yesterday and the river is so low, that some of the Indians, who know this navigation
well, began to doubt whether our boat could come up, but the present rain appears likely to afford a seasonable and plentiful supply, the river is
already rising. We notice a great appearance of strawberries. 26th 7 day. This morning the river appears to have risen about 18 inches, yet it is
but very little muddy; the day being fair considerable progress was made in our clearing; cutting and heaping old logs, grubbing &c., in which
we sometimes had the help of a neighboring Indian, whose strength and activity, evince there was nothing wanting but the will, to make him a full
workman at business of this kind. 27th First day. This being First-day, about 11 o'clock we sat down together for religious retirement, which
through favor was a strengthening time to some of us, May such seasons be remembered with gratitude and thankfulness, and may our young Friends be
encouraged and strengthened to keep up such religious opportunities when we are far separated. Which I trust they will. [says J.S.] Soon after the
close of our sitting and whilst preparing what little provisions we had left, for our dinner, an Indian man came into our cabin, and presented us
with about four pounds of fresh venison without any bone in it. for which we offered him a quarter of a dollar, which he showed some reluctance at
taking, but as he could speak no English we were altogether at a loss to know whether it proceeded from what we had offered him being too little or
from an intention of giving us the meat, we however prevailed upon him to receive the money. We aftoward made him understand we wanted to go down in a
canoe to Cornplanters village, where we had appointed to have a Council tomorrow: he made signs that he would go with us, when the sun got to such
a place, pointing with his hand. He then left us, and we immediately proceeded to fry some of the venison. We sat down to our dinner with thankful
hearts for so unexpected a supply, which was very acceptable, as we had not so much of our own left as would make a meal for one person, and had
heard of none to be purchased in this country though we had made considerable inquiry. When inquiring for bacon at Pittsburgh we were told it was not
necessary to carry meat here, for there was plenty in this place; however we thought it not best to trust to an uncertainty, and have therefore 120
lbs of bacon coming up in the boat, We have only obtained one pound of dried meat, and the venison above spoken of since being here. About 4 in the
afternoon, three of our com pany, together with the aforesaid Indian, set off in a canoe for Cornplanters village, leaving two of our young men to
take care of our horses, house &c. and come down on horse-back in the morning. Sometime after we arrived the Indian who accompanied us, handed
Cornplanter the money we had given him for the meat, saying something to him in their own language, and in a few minutes Henry O'Neal (some write it
Obeal) informed us that he said he intended to give us the meat, that he was not willing to take any pay for it, but could not make us understand him:
therefore he had brought the money along in order to give it back to us. We received the money, expressed our appreciation of his kindness, and
presented him with the same price for his trouble in bringing us down in the canoe, upon which he readily received it. 27th 2nd day. Our young men
arrived and about 12 o'clock the Indians were generally collected in council, there being 5 or 6 women also present. Early in the opportunity,
Cornplanter made a pretty long speech, which did not appear to be directed to us, but was for an Indian there in the house,* * as our interpreter
afterward told us. who had been charged with murdering a white man: for which he had been tried but being aquitted, was now at liberty, the expensive
of which had cost Cornplanter $200. The Chiefs speech appeared to be delivered with much earnestness, and seriousness. He then addressed himself to
us, expressing his satisfaction in seeing us all in good health &c. He then informed us they were now ready to hear what we had to say to them. After
this information we sat a few minutes in silence, wherein we felt an earnest desire that we might be renewedly favored with best direction in our
communications &c. to these people. Inward stillness, or anything like it, is a state of mind that only a few of them appear to be acquainted with.
We were, in a short time, favored with a degree of weight and strength to make some introductory communications, pertaining to the nature of our
business, and then read the following, which we had prepared and written down on the 22nd was read and interpreted. To Cornplanter, and all our Indian
brothers of the Seneca Nation now living on the Alleghany River. Brothers. We have now been several days among you, and have had councils with
your Chiefs and wisemen, and have looked about your country, and have agreed upon a place for our young men to begin upon. We are glad and thankful
to the Great Spirit, that every thing we have proposed for your good, has been so agreeable to your minds, that we seem to agree like brothers, having
but one mind in everything we do: and we hope, brothers, we shall continue to be of one mind about all things, we have been speaking to you of.
Brothers, you know the place we have chosen for our young men to begin upon at Genesinguhta; and we hope some of your young men will settle by them,
and fence off lots for themselves, as they see our young men fence of theirs. Our young men will be willing to assist and instruct them in working
their lots. We do not think our young men will be able to raise any more of their lot this year, than they will want for themselves, but we hope
against another year, they will have a little to spare. and we are willing they should give to your old and infirm people that cannot work, one
bushel out of four, of all grain and so forth, they have to spare. Brothers, in order to encourage you still more to take up work, and to follow the
ways we point out to you, we will agree to give you a little more. We will send you Smiths tools, when our young men write us, that you need them.
Brothers, if you are industrious this summer, and raise a goodd eal of corn, and some wheat, we will help you build a good mill next summer, if a
suitable place can be found for it. You must find half the money to build the mill, and we will find the other half. We hope, brothers, you will save
some money* * annuity. you get from the white people, that you may have your share ready against next spring. We think you had better choose one of
your chiefs to keep this money for you, till the time is wanted, or perhaps is may be all gone for whisky, or something that will not do as much
good as the mill would. Brothers, We are also willing to learn you how to farm by agreeing to give some small premiums, to such of our Indian brothers
who are industrious and raise a good deal of grain, Brothers, We will give to every Indian man living on this river who shall raise 25 bu. of wheat or
rye, in one year on his own land not worked by white people, the sum of two dollars. 2nd For every 50 bushels of corn raised by one man in like manner
afore said, the sum of two dollars. 3rd for every 50 bushels of potatoes raised by any one man in like manner aforesaid, the sum of two dollars. 4th
For every two tons hay raised as aforesaid and put into a stack or barn, not being mown or drawn in, by white people, the sum of two dollars. 5th For
every 12 yards of linen cloth made by an Indian woman out of flax raised on her, or her husband's land, and spun in her own house, the sum of two
dollars, to be paid to the woman. 6th For every 12 yards of woolen or linsey cloth made by an Indian woman out of the wool of her own, or her husbands
sheep, and spun in her own house, the sum of two dollars to be paid to the woman. Brothers we will give you these premiums for four years, if our
young men stay here so long - upon these conditions that the person who applies for a premium must produce a certificate from two of the Chiefs,
signifying the quantity of grain, cloth, &c: for what the premium is demanded, and that it was raised, or made, in the manner above mentioned, - and
that the person has not been intoxicated with whiskey at least for the term of six months before that time.* * that they apply for their premiums. And
our friends are hereby authorized and desired to pay the above premiums, agreeable to what is herebefore expressed. 5th Mo. 22nd 1798. Joshua
Sharpless. John Pierce. Henry Simmons. Joel Swayne. Halliday Jackson. After reading these propositions, we were again enabled, solemly to
expostulate with them on various subjects, relative, both to their moral and temporal conduct: but particularly on their excessive use of strong
drink, a variety of instances whereof we had been eye witnesses to. Rivers of them, as heretofore, appeared solid; and particularly the women, but
much the greater number manifested no real seriousness They then proposed retiring into a private council in order to consult of an answer, which they
accordingly did; and returned in about an hr. when Cornplanter made the following speech. Brothers, We now hear all what you would wish to do among
us: you are come here to see us brothers. You wish us well, you wish us to become as the white people. The white people are rich and got everything:
the Indians are poor and have nothing. Brothers. One thing you told us, it would be good for us to build a mill: we must find $400 and you will find
$400. Brothers we cant say but few words at this time about the mill: we will consult Captain Chapin: if he thinks we will receive our money, and
will be able to raise the money you propose, then we will do it. Brothers, We know how far you have come to see us: it is a great way way from the sea
shore, where our forefathers once lived. The white people have cheated us, and got our land from us, and now we have but little left. We will try to
learn your way. Brothers, You know there are some bad people amongst us: and you know that we have been cheated, and that makes us bad, and our minds
uneasy. If we had not been cheated, we should have been very rich people and had plenty of every thing: and then our minds would be easy, and we could
think upon the Good Spirit. Brothers, The reason I mention to you about our being cheated some of my warriors win't mind what I say to them, but will
have their own way, because they know I have often been cheated by the white people. If I had never been cheated then my warriors would believe
me, and mind what I say to them: but now they won't mind. Brothers, we can't all go to work at once Some of my warriors will go a hunting to get
provisions, and sometimes they break a gun, and then it takes a great deal of money to get a new one. We have very few hoes and axes and
such things amongst us, and we are not able to get them. Brothers, I will go along with you to Canandaigua and there we will get matters settled
about the mill, and bring it to back to your young men in writing. Brothers, this is all I got to say, we will now shake hands. At the close of this
speech we expressed a few more words; representing among other things the unreasonableness of their present practice, in suffering their women to
work all day in the fields and woods, with their hoes and axes, whilst the men and boys were at the same time, playing with bows and arrows; and
recommending them to begin our way, by early setting their boys to business, taking them out to hoe corn &c. By early ha bituating them to work, their
minds would be turned to it, and they would not think hard of it. We concluded with seriously pressing on their minds the remembrance that it was
from the Good Spirit they received every good thing: and that he could hear every word they said, and see every thing they did: and that they were,
equally with the white people, objects of his tender care and regard: and that the great difference, between them and white people, in regard
to riches and poverty, of which they so frequently spoke, was the natural result of the diferent plans pursued in [endeavoring] to obtain
the blessings of this life: and that as their ground was equally good with with that possessed by white people, it would also be equally productive if
the same industry and method of farming it were pursued. In a few minutes after we had concluded, and informed them so, Cornplanter observed, now all
things are settled and done. We will cover up the council fire. They dined with the chief. About five o'clock, we had a loaf of warm Indian bread with
beans in it, baked in a Duch oven, and a little butter was all that was set before us. They informed us they had no meat. In the evening our young men
returned to their own house at Genesinguhta, and we (Joshua Sharpless and John Pierce) took boarding with Cornplanter, who used us kindly, and as
well as his house will afford, We had teas of diferent kinds, one was made of sassafras root, and wheat bread baked or rather fried in a pan that ate
very well. We inquired of Cornplanter respecting the routes to return, not liking the way we came, amongst others, for a way to Canadaigua, and
how far. He told us it was 160 miles and not a very difficult road. That he and his son Henry were going there in a few days. We tarried here to
settle some matters with him relative to our leaving these parts, which we wish now to affect as soon as we should see our goods safely arrived, also
to be here when they came, [as we are looking for them any time now, and they were directed here, but we do not wish them unloaded here since our
young men have settled farther up the river.] Some time after night a messenger arrived, here from the chiefs at Buffalo requesting Cornplanters
attendance at that place, the surveyors &c being come, in order to run the line of their respective reservations, agreeable to a treaty of last
summer with Robert Morris. Cornplanter expressed a particular desire that we should attend their council on the occasion, at the aforesaid place. We
had for some time past felt our minds rather turned toward taking Canandaigua and Oneida in our way home: and upon inquiring were informed that we
could not get to Canandaigua from this place without going through Buffalo which makes the proposal of the Chief for us to accompany them feel
pleasant. It now remained to fix on a time for setting out, but to this end the want of our goods seemed in the way, as we had heard nothing of them
since we left Pittsburg; a full result was therefore deferred. 29th 3 day. Most of this day and part of the preceeding was employed in digesting our
minutes, writing letters and so forth, one of which was to Thomas Wister showing the present state of our business at this place, and another
to General Wilkinson containing a brief narrative of our proceedings since our arrival here. In a private conference with Cornplanter and two or three
others we obtained the following information; that the Indians in this reservation consist of between 3 & 4 hundred individuals: they have 3 horses,
14 horned cattle, 1 yoke of oxen, and 12 hogs, all private property. They have two solemnities in the year in form of public worship or
Thanksgiving to the Great Spirit for his blessings, one in the Spring, and the other about the time of their corn ripening 30th 4th day. The fore
part of this day was employed in writing and so forth. About noon our goods arrived at this place, and were heartily welcomed both by us, and the
Indians, many of whom gathered round the shore, having never seen such a boat before. The captain did not leave Pittsburg untill 3 days later than he
expected - he had been 15 days coming, and it was 270 miles to follow the course of the river. Both he and his men appeared tired, expressing much
satisfaction that they had gotten here: but when we let them know our house was 9 miles further up the river and that we wanted the goods taken
there, they were very unwilling to comply; there was no road to wagon them up, and several of our packs were two large for canoes. We at length
effected our purpose upon the following conditions, We gave them three dollars as a present, hired an Indian pilot for half a dollar, and agreed to
write to Major Craig of Pittsburg on his (the captain's) behalf as follows. viz. Jenuchshedago 5th Mo 31. 1798. Respected Friend Yesterday Thomas
Leeks arrived at Cornplanters lower village with our goods; and our settlement being nine miles higher up the river we prevailed with him
to continue up to that place: If it accords with thy orders to satisfy him for this extra labor, the business will be settled: if not please to
present these lines, with his extra bill, to Abner and Jesse Barker who are hereby authorized to settle it, placing the same to the account of Thomas
Fisher of Phila. Note, we have made him a present of three dollars which we do not wish deducted out of his reasonable bills. I am with respect thy
friend. John Pierce. Isaac Craig Pittsburg. This evening let Cornplanter know that we should now be ready to depart for Buffalo, as soon as would
be convenient for him. He informed us he could not be ready in less than four days. We felt some reluctance at being detained after our business was
done, but submitted to the time proposed. Owing to the want of a suitable interpreter Our Travellers had but little conversation with the Indians
beyond their business affairs, being now through with that, they conversed a little about their customs, in which Cornplanter said they did not
keep the First day of the week but every one tried to think good in his own mind. As we could read the Bible, he queried whether there was any thing
said in it about the Indians? We informed him, the Bible mentioned all nations, Kindred, Younges, and people; and that included the Indians. We would
have been glad to have told him, that though the Indians could not read the Bible, yet they were not wholy deprived of the benefits of the coming of 
Christ, for, that a manifestation of his spirit, or measure of his Grace, was placed in each of their hearts, and would if minded or given way to,
reprove for all wicked words, and wicked actions, also produce peace for well doing,- but this was too refined and delicate a subject for our
interpreter to handle. 31st 5th day. Took our last farewell of the Indians in this place about 9 o'clock, and set off with Cornplanter, his son Henry
and a nephew, up the river in a canoe to his saw mill, where we took leave of the Chief and his son for the present, with a promise that they would
call on us at our house at Genesinguhta, in five days to go with us to the mouth of Buffalo, in order to attend the Council there, the Nephew and son
of the Dutchman who tends the saw mill, took us up to our farm, where we found our goods had safely arrived about two hours before, and unloaded, we
gave to the boatman, Thomas Leeks the aforesaid lines to major Craig, Our letter to General Wilkinson, and that to Thomas Wistar, with several
others enclosed. The boatman having got their business accomplished respectfully bade us farewell, and with cheerful countenances went merrily down
the lively current, expecting in four days to arrive in Pittsburgh. The remainger of the day was employed in unpacking our goods, and repacking them
into our cabin, Several of the articles were wet but nothing appeared much damaged. After the things were arranged we experience a great change. Our
naked walls, empty house, and bare cupboard, met with a rich supply; our hard and cold beds, were warmed and softened, with blankets: we are now able
to make a cup of tea or coffee, though without milk or butter: we have bacon and cheese to eat with our bread: and one of our young men says they want
nothing but a cow to make their living equal to Chester county. We are visited every day more or less by the Indians, who are much pleased viewing
several kinds of our goods: which satisfaction is increased by our giving them some small matters. We showed them Howell's map of Pennsylvania,
with which they were much diverted, and seemed to understand it pretty well, particularly the Alleghany river, and the large streams which run into
it. We have received of Cornplanter, since we came into this country, about fifty pounds of flour, besides several days board for two of us, for which
he refuses taking any pay. We therefore this day made him a present of 6 Bandana handkerchiefs, one for his wife, and one for each of his five
daughters, Three fine tooth combs, two pocket knives one paper of needles, 6 thimbles and 2 1/4 yds. of cloth to his son Henry, who has
steadily attended on us as interpreter. 6th Mo. 1st 6th day. This morning being wet our young men were employed putting handles to their tools,
hanging their grindstone &c. In the afternoon we, (that is Joshua Sharpless and John Pierce) went about a mile up the river, in order to view a
small creek, that we were informed of, as most likely to afford a millseat: we went a considerable distance up the creek, fount it had plenty of fall,
and appeared to have a sufficiency of water, with a good bank and place for a mill, much out of the way of floods, which are sometimes great in this
river, and at the same time so that canoes might come up a short distance to the mill; but against these advantages, there are some disadvantages
in regard to getting the water where we want it. Millseats are very scarce in this reservation, we have yet seen none excepting the above worth
building upon. 2nd 7th day This day our young men got to their cleaning again, and have about 1 1/2 acres ready for the plough. We were easy to agree
to spending some days at this place, and to feel, and sympathize with our friends under their various trials: and notwithstanding we had no power from
our friends at home relative to things here. We believed the urgency of the occasion would justify us in joining with them in a serious
consideration of what might be profitably proposed to the Oneidas on the subject of the young men working on the farm with our friends, as well as
the necessary arrangements relative to William Gregory's prospect as a smith. 3rd First day. Two Indians one a chief paid us a visit this morning, we
being employed in writing and reading. We endeavored to let them know that we did not work on First day, though we found it difficult to make them
sensible of the reason, Since our coming into these parts we have kept meetings twice a week, Our opportunity to day, felt like a parting
meeting, and a travil was experienced for the presentation of our young men, whom we expect shortly to leave, It was a time wherein we witnessed a
renewal of strength. 4th 2nd day A wet day. Cornplanter sent word that a number of indians are going with him to Buffalo, who were not fully ready,
but would call on us tomrrow. The nights are still cool: we have steadily had four blankets under us and the same number above, yet none too many. I
do not recollect seeing the sunrise clear since we came here [principally on account of the fog] 5th 3 day. A pleasant morning. Not knowing what
time Cornplanter and his company would call upon us, feeling the prospect of a separation, we sat down together to take a parting opportunity. It
was a time of retirement wherein the canopy of Divine love was spread over us, to the contriting of our spirits, and a living travail was was
experienced, that as the time was approaching when we expected to part, that Ancient Goodness might be near to them that stayed, to comfort,
strengthen, and preserve them in their lonely cottage and arduous undertaking, which considering the many favors we have experienced, since we sat
out, there was no cause to doubt, that as they were truly watchful and attentive on their part would still be continued, and that we who are
going, might also experience the Lord's protecting power, through a solitary wilderness and a tedious journey. The Indians did not come. 6th 4th
day. After waiting with some degree of impatience, untill between two and three o clock this afternoon, we were visited by Cornplanter his son, and
two other Indians. The chief informed us that one of his daughters was taken very ill yesterday, and that a relative living in his family had fallen
from a horse and broken his arm, which had prevented him from coming soon er, and now he could not go with us for three days on this account, for
which he was very sorry: but if we did not like to wait so long he would hire a guide and send him with us. We informed him, we regretted that
these circumstances prevented our having his company, but believed it would be best for us to set off tomorrow morning, for we wished to spend a few
days with our friends in Canada: and in seven days hoped we should meet him at Buffalo, where he said he intended to be on that day, if the state of
his family would permit. A guide was accordingly provided, who engaged to call us tomorrow morning by sunrise. A heavy shower of rain this evening:
the river for several days past has been nearly three feet higher than when we first came. 7th 5th day. About sunrise this morning, our guide, Indian
John, a chief that lives in this town called on us. About 5 o'clock we took an affectionate farewell of our young friends, and set off for the mouth
of Buffalo, For some time after we sat off this morn ing, my* * J.S. mind was uncommonly easy and cheerful, so that I passed along in a lively and
well qualified state to make travelling pleasant; but before evening, I found my stock of spirits was much exhausted. About 11 o'clock we had a very
heavy rain, such a one as seldom happens. We got very wet. When near Cattaraugus river we passed through a very rich bottom, with an uncommonly
luxuriant growth of vegetation; and about sunset arrived at the stream, which we found to be many perches out of its banks at the fording place. Our
guide made signs to us that is would run over our horses' backs and sweep them away. We therefore concluded to pitch camp being in an open bottom,
and where there was a pretty good supply of grass, so that our horses would have done very well if it had not been for gnats and musquitos. We
struck up a fire, and under some bushes we had put up to keep off the dew, got a pretty comfortable night's rest. We saw neither house nor cabin in
this days ride. 8th 6th day. The Cattaraugus fell several inches during the night, but at the place selected for crossing, the water ran very
swiftly, We made a sign to our guide to lead the way he being well mounted on Henry Simmons' horse, it being the largest in the company, but he showed
evident marks of fear. The task being likely to fall upon me,* * J.S. I pulled off my great coat and tied it up well behind me and raised my saddle-
bags by putting some luggage under them, and having previously cut a pole to carry in my hand, to measure the depth of the stream, I entered the river
without much fear, though not without care, and found our guide was mistaken in its depth. And well for us he was, for had it been as deep as he
supposed, no horse could have stood before the stream. He gave us to expect that the water would come within six inches of the horses' backs. I got
safely through, my companions viewing me with anxious minds. When they saw me safely landed, they followed and arrived also safe ly with gladened
hearts. We pursued our journey down the rich bottoms of the stream, and in ten miles arrived at a village of Muncy Indians, in a champaign country,
being the first dwellings we have seen since we left Alleghany. We stopped at a house in this village and breakfasted on our own provisions. The
town and pasture land were enclosed in a lot of 12 or more acres, which looked clean and pretty, having very good pasture within the enclosure. The
house we went into had a large quantity of corn hanging upon it; considerably more than I saw all the time I was at Alleghany. We understood they
sell many bushels every year. Most of the principal men in the village and others gathered into the house where we were, and a white man living
amongst them could interpret, we informed them of what we had been doing at Cornplanters settlement: and of friends concern for the Indians in
general; with which they expressed their satisfaction: saying they took it very kind that we had called to see them, and to inform them of what we
had beeing doing at Jeniscatego, for they had heard some thing about. We then shook hands and bade them farewell. In about 7 miles of a swampy tedious
road, we arrived at Lake Erie, and enjoyed viewing this watery element as we travelled along the beach to the mouth of Buffalo, 29 miles. The
prospect through the remaining part of the day was pleasant, rather heightened by our having been so long confined in the woods. On our left the
surf rolled gently to the shore two or three feet high: on our right rocks, and stones were piled up in places, from 20 to 60* * Some perhaps 100 ft.
feet high, as upright as the wall of a house, and in other places projecting over, several feet. The bottom of these rooks, by the beating of the
waves, and sand, and gravel was worn into curious shapes, and as smoothe as polished marble. It was interesting to see the water trickling down
from the top of these rocks, as well as to note some rocks standing in the edge of the water, as large over, round, and as smoothe as a milstone, In a
number of places the water came up to the wall of rocks so that we had to ride 40 or more perches in the lake, in places middle deep, and the water
was very dirty with beating the sand, so that we could not see the bottom, and did not know but the next step the horses made, might take them over
their backs. In a number of places the waves came up against the rocks with such force, at times as to cause the water to fly over our heads,
making the scene romantic. We reached the mouth of Buffalo creek before sunset. Here we met with a company of men who were going to run out Robert
Morris's late purchase of the Indians into townships: John Thompson, an old acquaintance from Delaware County, being one of the head surveyors.
He invited us to stay all night with them, and directed a tent to be put up for us. We acknowledged his kindness and accepted his offer. We were
entertained with much simplicity on bread fish and chocolate, and had a pretty good nights rest, which we wanted, having travelled 45 miles to day.
For the last 80 miles there were no inhabitants. 9th 7th day. Crossed into Canada - a rough strong current in the river - our boat narrow and
tottering, and one of the horses a little unruly, so that we felt thankful when we got on shore. Went to Daniel Ponds where we were kindly
received, and felt glad we were once more among our friends. In the afternoon we paid a visit to Joel Morris's, who were much pleased in seeing us:
and in the evening went to my old home, when here last fall, at our friend Asa Schooley and wife's, who were truly glad to see us, and we them, Here
we got a clean good bed which we had not had since we left Pittsburg, having for nearly four weeks slept on the ground, or on boards in our blankets.
10th, First day. Attended the meeting at Asy Schooley's which was in good degree a solid opportunity: between 30 and 40 men and women collected,
several of whoom were hopeful young persons. In the afternoon went to Joseph Haines, and Adam Burrells, where we had a refreshing time, and parted
with his family in near affection. 11th 2nd day. Our travellers set off early, to visit Friends in that neighborhood and others in the vicinity which
occupied three days. when they returned to Asa Schooleys. Here we will again trace their steps. 14th 5th day. About 9 oclock this morning we took
leave of our kind and valued friends, Asa Schooley and wife, and their children, having their, and many Friends hearty wishes for our safe return.
Arrived at the ferry at 12 o'clock, where we found the chief ferryman so in liquor, as not to be fit to take any care, but a trusty old man who
sometimes assisted, agreed to take us over. The wind was pretty high and the river ran swiftly: so he concluded to lash two boats together, to keep
the one our horses were in steadier, which was very acceptable to us, having found when we crossed before that it was a dangerous ferry, and a rocking
boat; now we went over steady, though the current beat us down the river three fourths of a mile. Shortly after getting ashore we saw a man at a
great distance riding toward us, whom we presently knew to be our Indian John, who was coming to look for us. He appeared much pleased to meet with
us, as we were to see him, and find our horse, rather (Henry Simmons') was safe. We got to Buffalo about 2 o'clock and though a day later than we
agreed to meet Cornplanter here yet neither he nor any of his company, were come. About sunset his son Henry and another Indian arrived, and informed
us that Cornplanter and ten or twelve more were on their way and would be here by 10 o clock tomorrow. 15th 6th day. About 12 o'clock Cornplanter and
his company arrived at the opposite side of Buffalo, We walked down to the river to meet them when they came across: They seemed pleased to see us.
Cornplanter gave us a letter from our friends, dated five days after we came away, They were well in health, and enjoyed peaceful minds, Cornplanter
having got some information that we were a little uneasy about staying, as none of Robert Morris's comimissioners were arrived; this afternoon took
an opportunity with us; observing that he expected we had seen enough of the difficulty travelling in the wilderness, to know that when people were to
be collected from different parts, it required time: and he hoped if Captain Chapin did not arrive this evening, we would try to make our selves as
happy as we could, and stay a few days longer, for he had a great desire we should be with them at the council, and see that that all things were
fairly settled. It brought a close exercise over our minds to know what was best to do. A number of the Indians were collected, yet it looked likely,
it would be some considerable time before all parties would get together, as none of the white people immediately concerned were come. We let him
know we would have been glad to attend council, but it was now drawing towards the last of the latter end of the week, and the white people did not do
business on First day; that it was not very likely Captain Chapin and company would leave Canandaigua before Second day morning, and that it would be
a number of days before the council would meet: however we were willing closely to consider the subject this evening. 16th 7th day. Our Travellers
endeavored to attend to Cornplanters request of last evening, and one of them felt, his mind, easy to move  homewards, the other said he did not
witness that clearness to set out he wished to experience, yet condescended if his companion thought best of letting the chief know, that upon
weighing his request, in the best manner they could they felt easy to move homewards this morning: this information was given him. He with a number
of others pretty soon came to our lodgings, and expressed, he was sorry we could not make our mines easy to have stayed a few days longer,
not doubting but Captain Chapin, and others concerned would be here to day. But perhaps as whe had been a considerable time from home, and living
was expensive, we might be much run out of the meas that would enable us to stay. I informed him that when I left home, I expected to have returned
in about 40 days, that it was now near fifty days, and if we went to Onida to see the Indians there, which we proposed, it would take near thirty days
more, before we could get home: that our circumstances in regard to money were not in the way, for we had plenty. He said he had left his home on
public business, expecting to have returned in fifty or sixty days, and it had taken him near a  year before he had got back, - and that he had found
it his duty, to sacrifice private convenience to pubilc good,- and he would have us do so too, We replied that the business we were about appeared to
be agreeably settled to both their and our minds: this other we knew nothing about till since coming amongst them: that we would have been willing
to have sat with them in council, though we did not know that we could beg any service to them; and that the business between him and Captain Chapin
relating to a mill, we might be fully informed of the result, when it was settled, by letter. He then informed us he was become perfectly reconciled
to our going, but as the council was expected to meet any day, he could not accompany us to Canandaigua, but John who had been with us, would go
through to the Genesee river: and that he wished the Good Spirit, who had hitherto preserved us would safely keep us on our journey, untill we
arrived at our homes. He further desired we would make ourselves perfectly easy about our young men, whom were left among his people, for he would
take the necessary care of them, and they would be entirely safe. We now took an affectionate farewell of the chief, and of the Indians present who
parted with us with much respect: and I (J.S.) can truly say  the longer I have been among that people, the more near and united they have felt to
me; and now on parting, they feel like brethren, with whom I had been intimately acquainted, and for whose welfare I feel ardent wishes About 8
o'clock we left Buffalo. Much of this days ride was through a country very thinly timbered, grown over with plenty of pretty good grass, so that I
thought thousands of cattle might have been fattened upon it, if were not for a species of large flies and mosquitoes. We stopped twice to let our
horses eat grass: but they were so worried with these insects, that they did little but run about, untill we got brush es and kept them off. If we
stopped our horses one minute in the woods, in some places, the mosquitoes would be on them in such numbers as almost to hide their color. Joshua
Sharpless, says, I covered my head, neck, and the most of my face with my silk handkerchief, wrapped a pocket handkerchief round one of my hands, and
with all the defence I could make, was much bitten and swolen with them. When night came on we got no relief. We took up our quarters about sunset,
beside a small stream of good water under the bough of an oak, and kindled fires in diferent places around us, in order to smoke them off: but with
all, we were worried that the whole night through, so that we slept but little, Our horses us may be supposed, fared no better. 45 miles [to day].
17th. First day. About noon we arrived at the Plains within 18 miles of Genesee river. I* * J.S. lodged at Pearson's four and a half miles on this
side the river, having left my companion* * J.P. a few miles behind on special business. Here our horses could eat grass without much molestation.
18th 2nd day. About noon he arrived at my quarters. He had a full interview with Captain Capin who is superintendent of the Indians for the United
States. John Pierce gave him full information of what we had been doing at Cornplanter's settlement, and of the young men we had left there. The
Captain expressed great satisfaction with our proceedings and thought there was encouragement to extend labour towards that people: for he had
been some time past, through the Onida settlement, and he apprehended he saw considerable improvement since Friends extended care there, About 2
o'clock we set off towards Canandaigua, and for 9 or 10 miles, passed through a thickly settled, highly improved country, considering the
settlement was no more than ten years old, which was very animating; having for 300 miles been mostly in the wilderness.  Here we had beautiful
timothy and clover fields almost constantly in view, with a good appearance of wheat, Indian corn, flax, oats &c. These we showed to our Indian guide.
We alighted and examined the heads of wheat. We showed him the flax that shirts &c. were made of, with which he appeared pleased. We saw four men
hoeing corn; these we pointed to, telling him they were not squaws or women,- and that was the way white people did their work. He knew our meaning
which he expressed by a lively smile. We now parted with him, having travelled together 170 miles, he going for Canandaigua and we for Maud Creek.
Cornplanter had informed us he was a sober man: we had opportunity to prove the assertion, being several days with him at the tavern at Buffalo,
where the Indians were drinking spirits, and I did not see him meddle with any. We lodged at Jacob Smith's who has a mill, and saw mill on a
fine natural full. 20 miles [to day]. They spent the most of the 19th, 20th, and 21st visiting friends in this part of New York. 22nd. 6 day. They
travelled onward by Canawago Creek, that runs into Oneida lake. As we decended a long hill to this place, we killed a rattlesnake about four feet
long it lay still in the road, neither offered to attack nor run. About 11 miles from Oneida village, we passed a well improved farm with a
good house, barn, and other buildings, and a large proportion of good timothy meadow, belonging to and in the possession of an Indian. He keeps
tavern, has his sign hanging out as common at public houses. About six in the evening we arrived at our Friend's settlement; found them all well
and very glad to see us. William Gregory and wife, and Hannah Jackson, having got there three weeks ago, after a passage of 15 days [from
Philadelphia]; William's chief view in coming was to set up the Smith's trade, and instruct some of the Indians in that art: Hannah Jackson was to
open a school, and besides literature, was to instruct the girls in knitting, sewing &c. Neither of them have yet opened their occupations, in part
occasioned by some unsettlement or uneasiness in the Indians minds, in regard to the sale of some of their land, and the running of their lines,
cominissionirs having been engaged in the business since the arrival of our Friends. 23rd 7 day. We went on foot this morning, Jacob Taylor bearing us
company, to see the Tuscarora and Stockbridge Indians. They lay south from this place up the Oneida Creek: the former two miles off and the latter
four. The land is good with considerable bottom up the creek, on which the Tuscaroras are scatteringly settled, most of them having some enclosure
of wheat, corn, mowing ground &c., with a considerable number of cattle, and some horses, sheep and swine, which made a pretty clever appearance. On
arriving at the Stockbridge settlement, the prospect of their improvement was more delightful, They have a large street between two and three miles in
length, which ascends up the middle of a valley one mile or more in width. On each side of this street their houses are erected, 20 or 30 perches
from each other. The land on this street is mostly cleared, and fenced off in small lots, which were in with wheat, corn, and grass for mowing or
pasture. It is about 9 years since they settled here in the woods. These first houses are mostly small and poor: some have laterly put up pretty
good houses, and others are preparing for it. They have gardens near their doors, and con-  considerable stock of horses, some swine and sheep. On
the east, near enough to supply them with water, runs the Oneida Creek, and on the west in the same valley, is a small stream: so that thiy are well
supplied with it. Towards the south end of their valley, they have a grist, and a saw mill. Their gristmill does considerable work for white
people, and there is a large quantity of logs and boards at the saw-mill. We called to see most of the families of note amongst them, and paid short
visits, with which they manifested great satisfaction and pleasure, as most of them knew one of us who had spent some weeks in that place before. We
also visited a school kept by John Quincy, a religious Indian man, who conducted it with becoming solidity and order, with which we were very much
pleased. Many of the women were solid, sensible, and engaging. Their houses were clean with wooden floors and glass windows: themselves and
children mostly clean and neat,the men and boys were hoeing corn &c. There appeared to be as much difference between Cornplanter's people, and
this nation, as between this people and the better livers among the white people. We went to see their mill which,  appeared well constructed, and
capable of doing a great deal of business. We also paid a visit to John Sergent their treasurer, presented our bill of advance toward their mill, and
were informed there was not enough money in his hands to settle it: we also discovered that he had indulged hopes, notwithstanding the clearness
of our article, of retaining a considerable part of what was in his hands, for some other appropriations to him more desirable: we gave him to
understand, when we entered into articles, we always expected to fulfill them, on our parts, and wished others to do so by us: adding that our
design was to assist and encourage them in getting a mill, which we had effected, and if government had advanced nothing towards it, we should not
have been hard on them, about their deficiency in regard to fulfilling their part of the agrement, but as government had now advanced so
considerable a sum, we were most easy to receive our own, agreeable to the article, and appropriate it to those of their brethren who appeared more
necessitous. He readily acknowledged the justness of this conclusion, and agreed to attend at Oneida on third day next, in company with such of the
Stockbridge chiefs and others as were concerned in this business in order to have it settled. After this conference, we went to Captain Hendricks,
where we were gladly welcomed, and dined with them, after which we drew a bond, had it signed and executed by Captain Hendricks, for $100, agreeable
to the instruction, in H. Drinker's letter to J. Taylor and placed the same. In the evening we had an opportunity with most of the principal men and
women of this tribe and the house of John Quincy, in which we were favored with some encouraging communications to a number of tried individuals,
as well as some affectionate and close reasoning with some of their leading men, on the serious importance of their setting a good example to the rest
of their people, not only in the mere exteriors of civilization, such as farming &c. but in the more interesting, that of a moral and good life; the
necessity of a renewed dilligence and watchfulness herein, some recent instances but two sorrowfully evince. At the close of this opportunity, a
chief on behalf of the men present made a pretty long speech: in substance expressing their thankfulness to the Good Spirit, who had put it into our
hearts to remember them, when at a great distance, and had preserved us in our way thither: that they felt themselves much strengthened by our good
words - that they were sensible they had done that which was not right, yet they hoped by the help of the Good Spirit they would do better for the
future. They wished the Quakers would continue to remember them, for they had found them to be true men, and that they really had the poor Indians'
good at heart. They wished the Good Spirit would preserve us on our way home to our families and friends. Then, after a short pause, a woman, on
behalf of the women present, delivered a speech much to the foregoing import, though we thought more weighty and nervous, She particularly observed,
that they now felt their minds encouraged, as it were, to begin a new in the good work of religion. It was a favored opportunity. We returned to
Captain Hendricks' where we lodged in a good clean bed. 24th First day. After breakfast we returned to our friends at Oneida, sat with them in their
meeting: in the afternoon we were visited by Schonadon, who informed us they were a going to get back tomorrow morning, to cover the smith's shop, and
that they would meet us in council after they had done. This day wrote to our friends at Alleghany, informing of our present situation, and of the
welfare of our friends here; which we forwarded to Buffalo by an Indian  from Grand river. Our young men here informed us there was some improvement
among the Oneidas since they came, although not such as they wished to have seen. 25th 2nd day. The Oneidas not having complied with the wishes of
Friends, as expressed to them two years ago, a council was, this afternoon, held on the subject. Tere are computed to be about 600 of these Indians,
all told, and are scattered over 10 or 12 miles, though the largest number is within two miles of this place, They have a large inclosure here of
perhaps two hundred acres, where they keep their horses, cows, and swine, (They have more horses than are necessary,) and in the enclosure are many
of their houses. They plant their corn, sow their wheat and oats, and have their meadow lots without any fence. It looks likely they will have to
change this mode of farming before long, for they have sold their land, and the white people are fast setteling on it. They have put up several houses
this spring, and we saw a number of cattle in the woods within two miles of the Indian's corn. There are several good houses among the Indians. One of
the chiefs has his painted red, The main road from Albany to the western country, goes through the enclosure there being a gate hung at each side.
Many travellers stop at the Red House and lodge: it is called a tavern. The fore part of this day was employed in preparing some propositions, and
arranging our business for the council in the afternoon. About 4 o'clock most of the chiefs, and a few of their people came together; being
seated they observed, they were now got together, and were ready to hear what we had to say to them, at the same time apologizing for the smallness
of their council, by informing that many of their people were gone out a fishing &c. We opened the business by letting them know that we were very
sorry to find that our friends who came last, had been more than three weeks amongst them, and during all that time, had never been able to get them
together: or to form any arrangements; or get any thing done respecting the business, which our friend William Gregory was particularly desirous to
assist to them in, We next proceeded to read, our said friends letter of introduction which was carefully explained to them by Nicholas Chusick our
present interpreter. We next proceeded to read the following propositions which had this morning been mutually agreed upon and signed by all
our number, viz. Brothers of the Oneida Nation You have now heard in the letter which has been read to you, that our friend William Gregory has come
amongst you in order to assist and instruct some of your young men in the useful trade of a smith. He wants no pay from you, or from government
for his trouble; but wishes you to provide a shop, and some coal for the purpose. (Captain Chapin having offered to find iron as usual,) and that two
of your young men, who want to learn the trade, should steadily attend at the shop, to do such smith work as you may want done, and he will attend
with them and assist them, and show them how to do it; and in order to encourage these young men to stick steadily to the work, so as to do all the
smithing you want done, and to learn the trade well, before our friend wants to go back again to his own people, we think you might allow them such
part of the money as government use to give your blacksmith as will enable them to buy themselves victuals and clothes, while they are learning
the trade and doing your work. Brothers, We hope you will get things ready soon, and that your young men will begin soon in this business, for our
friend dont want to stay a great while here, only just long enough to learn some of your young men this good trade. Brothers. You remember that
two years ago we proposed to you that some of your young men, should work on the farm with our friends, as apprentices, in order to learn how to farm
the ground like the white people, so that they might raise a great deal of grain, grass &c. off of your good land. Now: brothers you know two years
are gone, and none of your young men are come forward to work with our friends, as we proposed, and we understand your young men say, they can't
get victuals to stick steadily to their work: and therefore they cant do as we proposed: we will now make you another offer. Brothers, if three or
four of your sober young men above the age of 16 years, will come and work with our friends on the farm, and stay with them 6 months, we will agree to
board and lodge them; they must stick steadily to work 5 days in the week: the other day they may have to rest, and to go and see their friends &c.
They must be sober, and mind what our friends say to them, and do the work as they tell them it should be done, and not go off and quit their work,
without speaking to our friends about it, and knowing whether they are willing; and they must not go out at nights to frolicing, but stay about
home so as to be ready to go to bed at our friends common bedtime: and if these young men stay the six months out, and behave well in the manner
before mentioned, then our friends will give each of them, stuff for one cloth coat, 2 shirts, one pair of cloth leggings; 5 bushels of wheat,
10 bushels of Indian corn, and 10 bushels of potatoes; and if they will then go to farming for themselves; and their Chiefs will let them have
separate lots of ground to fence for that purpose, then our friends will lend each of them a plow with irons all completely, for one year, and by that
time they may be able to get some for themselves and then they must be returned, so that other young beginners may have them. Brothers, We shall
give a copy of these propositions in writing, signed with our names to your chiefs, and another copy will be left with our friends here, and if any
of your young men agree to begin to work with our friends as we propose they may set their names to these writings, so that both sides may 
understand every thing plain and clear, and have it all in writing to keep our memories bright. 6th month 25th 1798. Joshua Sharpless. John Pierce.
William Gregory. Jacob Taylor. Jona Thomas. After reading these propositions, we let them know in very plain terms that we were sensibly affected with
the manifest coldness and inattention which they had latterly appeared amongst them towards our friends; the ungrateful whisperings and surmises
that they had given way to relative to our having a design to take away their lands from them: reminding them of the various steps we had taken
amongst them from the beginning: the great expense we were at in mantaining our friends here amongst them; the improvements we were making on their
land, which they saw with  their own eyes; the wheat and clover they saw growing where there use to be none; the barn that was built, and the house
that was on its way; that all these things could not be done without a great deal of money, that we had never asked them for any, nor should: that we
had never asked them for any of their land: nor would be take it of them, if they would offer it to us: that we had told them before, and would now
tell them again, that whenever they were tired of us, and wished us away only to tell us so, and we would leave both their land and their country:
that we had no inducement to stay here among them, spending both our money and time, but purely for their good. Shortly after these observations their
speaker, Christian, spoke to us as follows. Brothers, we will say a few words to you about the blacksmith which is come from Philadelphia to instruct
us in the trade; you know we don't govern our young men; if they ain't willing to come, we cant force them: but we want to know how he intends to
work: whether for the Indians in common, or whether he  will do so much a day, and give it into the hands of their chiefs to be divided amongst the
people, adding, that if he worked for the Indians in general, it would be too hard for him, for they would be always plaguing him. So this we replied,
That the design of our friend in coming here was to instruct their young men, and show them how to do their work, and not to do it all him self: and
though we did not wish them to force their young men: yet if they could not be prevailed upon to come forward in the way proposed, our friend's
prospect would not be answered, and he would therefore be likely to make but a short stay with them: but as to the manner of working, our friend would
leave that to the chiefs Their speaker then proceeded as follows. Brothers, We are very glad to hear again the same words which you said to us two
years ago, and we are now of the same mind we were then: we remember your words and we believe you are a true people. We have heard our fathers tell,
that the Quakers were always friends of the Indians:  and what they told us when we wer boys we find it to be true now we are old men. Brothers. We
are very glad and happy to hear that your minds continue the same towards us about learning to farm: we believe it would be good for us, and we
will try to do what you propose. Brothers. Now it is very true, there are some bad people, who have spoke against you, that you had a mind to take
away our land: and some times when our minds were not right, we believed such talk, and this made our minds feel very ugly, but now we are convinced,
and sorry we believed such things: and we are fully satisfied, that you are true people, and we will continue to be of this mind. Brothers, we always
attend to what you said from the beginning, we know you want us to cultivate the ground so that we may live comfortably, and our wishes and desires
are to what you say so far as we are able, and to learn the farming business: we, the chiefs are determined to do all that we are able; but if we
dont do all that you would wish, we hope you wont get discouraged, but continue to do whatever is in your minds: and if we dont improve, the fault
will be our own, we cant blame you. Brothers. We will do all we can about the blacksmith and about the farming: we cant force our young men, but we
will try all round, all of us will try to get some young men to learn this trade, and to learn farming. Brothers. Now we thank you for the pains you
have taken for poor Indians, and we thank you for what you have said to us: and we will have council amongst ourselves tomorrow, after we have tried
what we can do; and then we will speak to you again about it. Brothers. This is all we got to say at present. We expressed our satisfaction
with what they had said, and then the council concluded. 26th, 3rd day. Agreeable to the arrangements of 7th day last, John Sergent in company
with John Quincy and Solomon, from Stockbridge came to Oneida, in order to settle the accounts respecting the mill Friends built there, which was
amicably done. About 5 o'clock this evening the Oneida chiefs and a number of their people again assembled in council, and after spending more than
an hr. in conference amongst themselves, they spoke to us to the following affect. Brothers. You have heard what we said to you yesterday, and what is
still on our minds. We are very glad you have taken such pains to come so far to help poor Indians, and we will try to fulfill all that you desire of
us. Brothers. We have been trying amongst ourselves to do as you proposed yesterday, and we find one man that is willing to learn the black smith
trade, and we find one young lad that will come out of his own mind to learn farming: He heard what you said yesterday in council, and he spoke to his
parents, and tell them he wants to go and learn farming, and do as you say, and his parents are willing, and he will come directly. Brothers, Now you
must not think hard of us because we have not got so many young men as you proposed, we have tried to get more, but most all our people from tother
end of the town are gone out a fishing, when they come home, we think we shall get some more: and we will do the best we can. Brothers. You mentioned
about a blacksmith shop, and about coal, now we intend to go at the shop early tomorrow morning: we have got the bark ready to cover it; and we shall
have it done tomorrow: and some will go to drawing wood for coal. Brothers. This is all we got to say. We expressed our satisfaction with what they
had said, and let them know we were very glad to see their chiefs of the same mind with us in this business, and we were in hopes they would continue
to be of this mind. We closed with renewedly reminding them of the obligations they were under to our friends, who remain here who have left all their
near friends and connections, to come and live amongst them, purely from a desire to do them good: and earnestly entreating them to keep this
fresh in their minds, and then we were certain they would be attentive and kind to them at all times. The conference ended satisfactorily. 27th 4th
day. This morning about 20 Oneidas, amongst whom were 4 or 5 of their principal chiefs, got early to work at the smith's shop, and some to hauling
and chopping wood for coal, that before noon they had a pretty commodious shop covered, and all ready for building the fireplace, and a considerable
quantity of wood ready for the pit. The lad also that proposed engaging in farming, entered into work with our friends this morning. That things now
wear a more encouraging appearance: and our friends here, sensibly feel it to their relief and encouragement. It now looks likely we may set off home,
to day, which feels very pleasant. One says, My mind for the most part has been easy for the most part about my family and concerns at home ever since
I left them: but our business appearing to be gone through the draught home feels strong. About 1 o'clock took an affectionate farewell of our
Friends, having before taken leave of the Indians, and set off to New Hartford - 17 miles - thence to the Mohawk river at Fort Schuyler 4 miles, where
we passed through  another town and crossed the river. Last 7th day while we were at Stockbridge a violent hail storm passed through the country, a
little to the north of us. Its direction was nearly east, and its extent twenty miles, and from one to two in breadth. As we returned to Oneida next
morning, we beheld its distructive effects on corn, oats, &c. This day for more than 5 miles it was affecting to see the distruction it had made.
Whole fields of wheat were entirely cut off so that we could not see one head standing, Corn, flax, and oats fared little better. Peas in the
gardens and fields, (acres being sown here) were entirely destroyed. Large fields of timothy were so broken down, that they smelled like fresh hay.
Poke bushes, the stalks as thick as rake handles, were knocked all to pieces, In short all vegetation where the storm reached, suffered much: the
fences and stumps were much marked, and the windows of houses were very much destroyed. This night Our Travellers lodged at Isaac Brayton's, three
miles from Fort Schuyler Here we had good accommodations both for our selves and our horses, which is the first public inn, we have met with, since 
for a moment- and Let us imagine our selves in their situation and reflect that thy have now been from home 8 weeks, and it will be nearly two more
before thy can meet their beloved families, and they have not heard from them since they left them. we left Pittsburgh of which this could be said.
Joshua Sharpless says, I have often admired since we came on this river, (the Mohawk.) to see such large heaps of ashes remaining untouched, where
potashes have been made. It seems to convey that the people have no idea, that the land would be benefited by spreading them over it, or otherwise
that they are too lazy to do it. Some men were hoeing very poor corn in a field where, I had no doubt there were 300 or 400 loads of ashes in a
heap. I called aloud to them to know why they did not spread that heap of ashes over the field, and so have good corn, and not be hoeing such poor
stuff. They stood like men amazed;- made no reply;- and we passed on. A few miles further we saw large potash works works close on the river, so that
when the ashes were thrown out of the tubs, they went into the water and were driven off with freshets, Our Travellers kept moving on through
Oldridges in the German flats, to Conoley's Tavern, 45 miles where they lodged; had good accommodations for themselves, but rather poor for their
horses, pasture being light. 29th A ride of 31 1/2 miles took them to the Mohawk river which they crossed in a boat, after which a ride of 5 miles
brought them to a public house which J. P. thus discribes. This is a poor inn, poor land, poor landlord, poor landlady, poor accommodations; may I
not be under the necessity of calling here often. 30th 7th day. Their next stopping place looked discouraging to weary travellers, but they
fared better than they expected, while their horses fared well. This part of New York state at that time seemed to have more licenced taverns than
otherwise, and Our Travellers frequently speak of oats being measured in rum quarts. One section near 100 miles in length almost every house on the
road was a Tavern, yet the traveller must make long stages to be any ways comfortably accommodated. It is relieving to note that as they approached
Albany there seemed to be an improvement in these respects, and 17 miles beyond that capitol, (that is east of it) at Leadman's inn, they had good
accommodations, both for man and beast. Another stage of 19 miles finds them at Catskill Bridge, where is an elegant house and good pasture, in other
respects nothing to boast of. Our oats were measured in rum quarts as usual in many places in this  state. The query is, Is the regulation of
public inns, a subject unworthy the attention of the legislature? must the farmer smart for it if he offers a pound of butter for sale a few grains
too light, and may the tavern keeper with impunity trick honest travellers out of their money, by selling three quarts of oats for four,? From here we
proceeded to Porren's tavern 11 miles where we lodged. This appears like a full handed Dutchman plenty of good wholesome fare, both for man and
beast, but little attention to please or oblige, At our next stop they were obliging, & gentle accommodation 7th Month 1st First day. We would have
been glad to have reached a Friends meeting to day, but found it impracticable, therefore thought best of travelling. We arrived at Samuel Baldwin's
about 4 o'clock, weary and glad we were got to a Friends house. The weather lately has been very warm, and we having travelled hard from Oneida, both
we and our horses wanted rest, we concluded to lay by here a day or two, get them shod, and help their backs which were a little sore. 2nd, 2nd day.
This morning concluded to pay a visit to our ancient friend Edward Hallock, about 9 miles east of our present quarters, being offered fresh horses
for that purpose, which we accordingly did to mutual satisfaction, and riturned in the evening. When near the North River about a mile before we
got to Edwards, we hat a very beautiful and extensive prospect for about 20 miles over the river, and as far each way up and down the stream. The
face of the country appeared to descend toward the river, and being mostly improved, the wheat and pasture fields, with large houses, barns &c.
intermingled with sheets of the river which presented in places, together with the town of Poughkeepsie 4 miles up the river on its opposite
shore, made the landscape truly delightful. This is a warm day. 3rd 3rd day. This morning attended to getting our horses shod with a prospect of
setting out in the afternoon, but were prevented by a thunder storm and rain. 4th 4th day. About 5 this morning set out from our agreeable quarters,
travelled about 18 miles to --'s tavern where we bated our horses and breakfasted, here is a pretty good house, but accommodations and attendance
indiferent. thence through Geshen to --'s 12 miles, where we baited; a good house, but rough landlord, then on another 12 miles to Dr --'s, a poor
place both for man and horse, but here we lodged having travelled 40 miles. We are now in New Jersey. 3 or 4 miles south of the New York line, having
travelled 500 miles in New York State. 5th 5th day. Traveled to Benjamine Schooley's 11 miles where we dined: he and his wife are exemplary Friends.
Thence to Jacob Lundys 16 miles, This has been the worst stage for our horses that we have met with since we left Oneida, and not very good for our
selves. We noticed a Dutch plough with one handle which stands nearly upright: a very short beam is almost the only plough that is used for 200
miles back. It appears to work easy both for horse and ploughman and does the work pretty neatly. To day we crossed the Wallkill River, fifty miles
higher up than we crossed it last First day: yet the stream is so large as to have a bridge erected on it a little above the fording place. In about 7
miles further, we crossed the Paulinskill which was the first water we met with that ran into the Delaware, having gone round the head branches
of said river as well as those of the Susque hanna. This hard days work only brought our travellers 27 miles nearer their homes. 6th 6th day.
Breakfasted at our lodgings, and proceeded to Henry Clifton's where we lodged. This days stage, 34 miles. We are now at Kingwood. 7th 7th day. We
travelled on, and on, past Bucking ham meeting house to our kind Friends Jacob Perry's 30 miles, where we got our dinners and rested a while. Thence
to Ezra Comfort's near Plymouth meeting house. 12 miles. where we lodged, and were kindly entertained. 8th First day. Breakfasted at our lodging and
proceed on to Willistown meeting house, 15 miles, to Amos Garretts, before meeting. [Amos was a brother in law of Joshua Sharpless.] he says, Here I
heard from my dear wife and family, being the first accound I had from them since I left home: and I felt truly thankful I was so near my own
habitation, and among my near relatives and intimate friends, We returned here from meeting and got our dinners, then set off home-  wards. Our
roads parting on the way, we took an affectionate farewell of each other, having been together 10 weeks, wanting one day: and travelled more than
1200 miles, in near unity and Christian fellowship, through some proving dispensations. Got home in the evening, and found my dear wife and family all
well, by whom I was gladly received, and I felt thankful I was got once more among them. John Pierce reached his home about 4 o'clock that evening,
and found his wife and family well, also.
