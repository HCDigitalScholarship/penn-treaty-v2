 Longevity, often living to the age of about 90 and as they suppose 100 years or upward, but as they keep no written Records of Births or other
occurrences, nor have any regular mode of computing time, other than by moons or Winters, or then remembrance of remarkable Events the most of
them can give no correct account how old they are. While we were raising Silver Heel's house a smart old woman, who was sitting on the Ground
looking on, we were told could call her Descendants round her to the 6th Generation. Some of them are subject to the Rheumatism which is supposed
may be a consequence of their traversing the Wood in all weather, night and day - wading in the river and Suffering their Cloathing to dry on them-
and often lying out exposed with little or no shelter to wet and cold- but from the observation I have made on the Inhabitants, where we have
stopd coming along, the Rheumatism is a complaint prevailing in this climate and therefore not wholly to be imputed to the Indian Exposures. The
Children are generally born in the woods - where the Woman accompanied by her Mother or some other Elderly woman retires on the occasion & of cold
builds a Fire - The Babe is immediately wrapd in a Blanket & in 3 or 4 hours the Mother returns with it to her own habitation. she washes her
blanket soon after in Cold water & something, on the same Day, with out injury to herself & in two or 3 Day after goes into the Wood, & Collects &
carries home heavy Loads, of Wood on her Back with the Infant on the Top of it tied to a Board. the Boards for this purpose are about two feet & a
half in length & one in breadth with a little Hoop in front to protect the Head of the Child or to suspend a curtain to cover it from flies or
cold. at the bottom a little foot board and at the sides are loop holes for the purpose of fastening the Child which is placed in an erect porting
with its hand down its sides & then swathed with a piece of Cloth from the feet to the Chin so light as to be unable to disengage itself- if the
Weather is Cold & the Child young a Wild Cat Skin or some other skin with soft Fur is put next to it. & if  a Female a little block is placed
between the heels to prie the toes a inclination inwards but if a male the feet are left to take the natural direction one consequence of this is
that the track of the different sexes may be easily distinguished & the children in this situation are carried about at pleasure & if taken into
the wood are laid down, or set up, against stumps on Trees as occasion requires while the mother is employed in gathering wood or any other
service- a few times in the day they loosen there but the children are so habited to it that they become quiet when uneasy out by being placed in
again this is continued till they are about 9 months old & anyway the purpose of keeping them straight as well as lending & carrying them with
more ease & security - Jonathan thomas said he once knew an Indian woman who went out pregnant & in ten Days returned with the infant on her back
& two hundred young  Pidgeons pickd & opened ready for dressing, inclosed in a piece of bark all the product of her own labour except that her
husband fell he trees for her on which the young  when the Indians Die the Women generally Inter them; having first dug the Grave. They lay bark
under & above the Dead body & their covering all with Earth with persons of note they usually bury Cloathing & Provision &c. Since Friends have been
here they are more in the way of having Coffins which the men make, but they rarely at tend at the Interment even now and formerly not at all -
when the Corpse is thus interd every moring for Nine Days successively the female rela tives & Neighbours of the Deceased Col lect at the
Deceased's Habitation & fall into a kind of throbbing Lamentation & then to crying & Wailing - for the space of Half an hour or more after which
they disperse & when the days of Mourning are thue ended they meet & are councild to Dry up their Tears after this endeavor to discard all marks of
lamentation They acknowledge One Supreme Being whom they call Ou'wan'nee'o - and be lieve Him to be the Creator of all good things - the author of
Happiness & the Rewarder, both in this world & the next for all good Sections - They believe also that there is an Evil Spirit whom they call
Neis'she'o'nay & who influences to bad Action & is the creator of all that is bad. Wolves, & all warlike Bears, Rattlesnakes, Poisonous Weeds, bad
thoughts & deeds & every thing that is productive of unhappiness both in man & on the Earth They believe there is a place of Happiness called
Hight'Caanon gay and that when they Die, their Lives have been regular in this World they ascend & are received there among the spirits of good Men
& Women, where the Great Spirit is the Head of all. He then presents & hangs about their necks a string of Implements for hunting providing
themselves a comfortable livings they are sent to hunt in a Warm country where there is plenty of Game. & fertile for Corn, Beans & other good
things. - The place of punishment they callOwhon'ga'go'u'nong geeh and consider it the reverse of that of Happiness being a Cold & Barren Country
little Game & nothing to kill it with  or to procure other necessaries that the Bad spirit there is Governor of all  and greatly increases then
Distresses arrayd in their best Clothing & Ornaments They assemble twice in the Year to render Thanks to the Good Spirit for the favours which he
hath conferd upon them - the first is in the Fall of the Year when the Corn, Beans, Squashes & Potatoes are ripe & the other about the middle of
Winter when they return with Game & Skins from Hunting - At these Times the men, Women, & Children Collect & an examination takes place what
uneasinesses are among them and what evil acts each one has committed of there it is also common that they make Confession, the design of which is
that all wrong things should be done away & that where Differences have existed a reconcilliation take place & a promise on the part of the
Offenders to by to do better for the future which done the Council assembled forgive them. They then divide into small Companies Men & Women apart
& dance around & in each House in the Town. These Dancing Companies are preceeded by two Men, appointed for the purpose, who are dressd in the
most frightful manner they can  devise, being coverd with Bear Skins & a bag of Ashes tied about their middles behind them & a hole to admit the
Ashes to run about as they move- their faces are coverd by a Large Painted mask having a high mane on the crown made of the coarsest long Horse
Hair standing almost erect & large Eyes encircled with a flame coloured ring- the mouth is open & shewn their own Teeth with which They Grin in a
terrific manner & their Hands are blackd so as to leave the mark with every Person they lay them on- In their Hands they carry the Shell of a mud
Tortoise which has been dried for the purpose with a stick thrust thro' it which extends the neck & large Head to its full extent and inside of
the Shell are a quantity of Pebbles- Which when shaken make a Dismal rattle- these men going from House to House rub this Rattle on the sides & up
& down the  Door Ports- they also frequently enter into the House but say nothing nor do any Injury- as they travel about if they meet with any
Person male or female in their way they pursue them- those who turn about & receive them in a friendly way they shake hands with, yet say nothing-
but it is rather expected that many should run as if terrified- these before getting into a House are pursued & if overtaken are laid hold of &
blackd with their Hands but no other injury is offerd and except a frightful yelling noise any things spoken- The design of these frightful
representations is to Personify and imitate the Bad Spirit & to remind the Indians of the Necessity to amend their Ways & avoid wrong things-
After these Ceremonies are performed they Collect at the Council House where they away & paint a Dog (a White one is preferd) the Poor Dog is then
killd & thrown on  on a Fire prepard for the purpose. the Indians, mean while Dancing round the Fire and Hooping with a Great noise. The Dog is
Esteemed by them as approaching the nearest to themselves of any other Animal and therefore is devoted on these occasions as a sacrifice to the
Great Spirit, and together with their Dancing is under a profession of pleasing Him- during this ceremony they are feasting occasionally on Corn
Vegetables & Venison this Venison is taken by encircling a large space of Hunting Ground & all the Deer  here Killd are Devoted to this Feast.
about a Pound of Tobacco, of a particular Kind which they consider as peculiarly agreeable to the Great Spirit is also thrown on the Fire while the
Dog is burning, in the smoke whereof the Spirit of the Dog ascending is believed to be received by the Great Spirit as a Sacrifice of a Good
Savour- during this Ascention one of their Chiefs whom they call their Minister addresses the Great Spirit in a Speech, the purport of which is an
Acknowledgement for favours received Thanks for His Preservation in times past and imploring His continued care &  protection- he then addresses
the People advising how they ought to Conduct themselves & pointing our some of the prominent Evils which they should avoid- one of the greatest
of these is stealing and another is for the Husband to Desert & Separate himself from his Wife during Pregnancy- but taking the Life of another is
not considerd a Crime so Capital, as they are left at liberty to revenge it by taking the Life of the Murderer- this may be done with impunity by
the Nearest Relative of the Deceased & they then convey the cries of Blood to be done away. The before described feasting & Dancing is continued at
Intervals & by Companies for the a Period of from five to ten Days- & Formerly toward the latter part of the Time many of them became intoxicated,
but at present among the Indians of this Neighbourhood this is entirely disused- and altho the feast is conducted with considerable noise &
apparent Confusion, it also is attended at Intervals with much Solemnity & on the part of many of them purely on  a religious ground & from sincere
& good motives- Formerly they had Image of a man which at the Time of those hearts was decorated in the Indian Stile with Wampum & Trinkets &c-
this was elevated on a Pedestal of about 6 feet in heighth & their Dance & feasting were performd round it & their addresses made to it- being
considered by them a Representative of the Great Spirit- about the Year 1802 this Image fell down & a council was held what was to be done- some
were for erecting another- others for discarding such a Representation entirely- Henry Obeal- Undertook to throw it in the River, the Council
first Consenting that he should do it if he would take upon himself & he answerable for any Judgement which might follow- this Henry agreed to &
tumbling it in the River it floated  down the Stream about Eleven Miles & lodged on an Island- Conudiu was appointed successor & Intercessor, to
endeavour to Keep Peace with the Great Spirit by averting Judments &c- They also Esteem him a Great Doctor & a Prophet when disposed to
communicate any thing to the Indians in this Way, he wraps or covers himself with his Blanket flying down quite still with two little Heaps of
Tobacco smoaking beside him, he pretends leave the Body & Ascend to the upper Regions where he says he holds communion with the Angels & recieves
from them information respecting such Things as the Great Spirit designs should be imparted to the Indians- after he has lain about half am Hour
he throws off his Blanket & opening his Eyes sets up- a council is then Calld & the subject of his pretended Visions communicated these professed
Revelations have in some Instances had a remarkable effect upon the Indians his first Visions in this way we were told was about 10 years ago I
was, that the Indians should leave off Drinking Rum & refrain from Selling their Lands- a Reformation accordingly took place, but it may be
remarked that before this, friends had been labouring with them much in those respects- Conudiu Continued an advocate herein & Some time after
being desirous of encouraging & pleasing his Converts he told them that he had another Vission & saw the bad Spirit, in a frightful form & having
Wings alight behind a Certain House but that after looking about for some time & finding that the Indians had declined drinking Rum & he had
nothing to do there, he flew over to Buffelo another Village where the Indians drank Rum & where he found plenty of Business. The sacrifice of the
Dog is now disapproved by some of them & Henry Obeal who tho' in some respects he has been a dissipated character & in other is still in the
commission of wrong things is notwithstanding  a discerning & enlightened Man) intends to open his Objections in Council- he also believes, with
respect to Witchcraft that it does not exist & occasionally esperessed this Opinion among them, but has to do it with care, and thinks he has
already incurrd the displeasure of many whose prejudices in this particular are yet strong-- In Time of War they formerly Roasted & Eat their
Captives- there are one or two among them here who have partaken of this inhuman feasting, but of latter time this Custom is exploded by this
Nation The Masks (before described) are some times worn as a cure for Diseases which cures in this way, are supposed to be effected by operating
on the Imagination. War is considered in its Origin to proceed from the Evil Spirit- that is the first agressor is instigated by him- but when
agression has taken place they consider is not only justifiable to Revenge the Injury but even believe that by so doing they are employd in the
service of the Good Spirit & that if they are killd in Battle they are recieved into the place of HappinessThey have, beside their Public
Devotions at Hearts & Sacrifices, a Kind of Family Worship which is when they are setting together particularly in the Evening, if one of the
Heads of the family feels an Impulse to address the Great Spirit he or she yield to it with an audible voice, and this, among the more serious
Class, is frequently performed, tho' not many stated Days or Times-- They are sometimes exercisd in this Way when their Friends are with them &
the subject of Aspiration is a Thanksgiving for preservation of their particular Family or Tribe & for supplying the varied necessaries & Comforts
of Sides- desiring their Continuance- If an Indian of any particular Tribe dreams a remarkable Dream respecting a Deceased Relative being Hungry
or in Need of Sympathy or assistance in any way the Indians of his Tribe are informed of it & a Hunting takes place in consequence- the Game then
taken  is prepared and cooked and a feast and dance in a religious way is instituted by the partees engaged which continues for a day or more.
Formerly when a stranger or distant friend entered an indian habitation it was common to set before them such provision as they had cooked in the
house which the guest partook of without ceremony except that of thanks, but friends have rather advised them not to give their provision
indiscriminately to wondering or idle persons  but only to strangers pariicularly Friends they have old or infirm least it should encourage
indolence and be a sound of oppression on to the industirious and frugal- in this respect therefore thine is some change  when a Seneca Indian
leaves his friend he tells him he is done, which amounts to farewell - but if any circumstance takes place which has given umbrage he withdraws
and says nothing -this is clear evidence that he is offended- Notwithstanding stealing in considered a great crime, it not unfrequently takes place
-when the person committing a theft is discovered complaint is made to the chiefs who dispatch a runner commanding  him to appear before the
council this mandate he immediately obeys The charge is then opend to him & if he is guilty confession is made and the Property taken is restored
if in being -- every Chief or Warrior in Council is then at full liberty to express what they think, one by one, all which he is obliged to hear.
Thus is considered a severe punishment, but no other is inflicted. Should the Person charged deny that he is Guilty, he is considered Innocent,
for it is remarkable in them that they confess when justly Charges. Jonathan told me that on such occasions, he had frequently been a Witness,
their countenance & Eyes betrayd them immediately, & of itself has been sufficient evidence to him that the Gospel has been preachd in them, or in
other Words that the Witness for Truth is placed in their Minds-- The Different Sexes are very jealous & shy of each other so that it is rare to
see a man & Woman, even of the same Tribe, conversing together without witnesses, & when a Woman has occasion to go abroad it is accounted
Honourable to take one or more Children with her to testify, if needful,  that she has been orderly - there are too many proofs that this is only a
pretended shyness, yet being santioned & established by custom it is productive of serious Evils - The Indians appear to be as well calculated and
to possess talents for social and rational enjoyment as any people, but custom putting a negative on an open friendly acquaintance of the sexes,
the natural tendency whereof would be the improvement of their mind and a knowledge of the good qualities one of the other, with the undesigned
production in many instances of permanent attachments -they enter into Marie age very early before their judgment in ripe for the choice, without
affection & without a knowledge of each others dispositions - the consequence of which is that separations often take place, so that there are
many instances now here of Men who have turned off several wives, and of women who have discarded as many husbands - there on both sides
marryagain (in a clandeitine ways to others  and in some Instances change back again, and thus, what ought to be esteemed the most Devious &
important Connection in Life, is lightly formed & dissolved and shifted about in a manner unknown among a People rightly Civilized -- In these
separations the Mother takes the Children & uses them Kindly They are very fond of Children & indulge them in most of their Wishes using little
restraint or Conection of any Kind, yet sometimes if Obstinate, tho' very young, they will plunge them in the River & if one Dip is not sufficient
it is repeated till they become very quiet, which they soon do. as the Children get a little older they will sometimes talk to them a long time in
a Kind of harrangue or Speech setting forth what the Child should do & what leave undone-- this at times has such an Effect that the Tears will
trickle down their Cheeks of the Child before the speech is ended-- at other times they ridicule them for doing wrong and tell them they are not
wise in doing so. to tell an Indian that he is not wise is a grating stigma. When a Person has been Sick for a considerable Time in a lingering
condition &  the appreciation of Roots & Herbs or other Medecine proves ineffectual to restore, it is common for their Friends to collect and
dressing two Men with Masks &c in the Manner described at times of Public Worship, they repair to the Habitation, which they go round rattling &
Rubbing the Tortoise Shells & whoping in a frightful manner- this altho' it is a known Custom & in time of Health does not alarm them, yet has
considerable affect on the Debilitated Indian whose fears being thus previously awakened by knowing what is to be endured. the men enter the House
continuing the noise & acting every Wild Contortion & Maneuvre which their Imagination Devise- some times they pull the sick Person, whether Male
or female, about the Room dirtying them with their black Hands &rubbing their Heads & Bodies over with ashes & handling in such a manner that a
Person unacquainted with their Custom would almost suppose they were going to kill the Patient-- after this Wild treatment of  of the sick Person
& dirtying the House thoroughly with their Ashes they withdraw & the nurse or some other Indian undertakes to Clean after them-- Absurd as this
practice appears it is said that in many cases it has a beneficial Effect by restoring Perspiration, working on the Imagination & rousing the
Indisposed Person to a Salutary Exertion--- Their Idea is they drive away the Evil Spirits in this way. - The Ancient Custom when an Indian died
who was the Head of a Family was to take out his Goods & burn the Hut, the Design of thus destroying the Habitation was to prevent any differences
which might arise among his Descendents or survivors respecting the possesing it that so Peace might be preserved- on such occasions of time the
husband does the Houses and where both Parents are dead This I believe is not correct, but I cannot rectify it. When an Indian of distinction &
property dies his Gun, Blanket, Knife, Trinkets & other This I believe is not correct, but I cannot rectify it. Property are preserved about 12 &
some times 18 months, before a Division is made- this Delay is in Consequence of an Opinion which they entertain that it is not decent or
respectful to take possession or bring them into use sooner-- they are then bro. into Council & held up to public view, the Indians present being
informed that here are the Goods of such a Deceased Chief. on the Articles being thus severally held up Any of the Young Men who inclince, are at
liberty to advance & Snatch them away, till the whole are thus distributed. the Relatives of the Deceased making no claim in consequence of
Connection. This Custom still prevails among some of the Indians in the Southern States but some of the more thoughtful among the Senceas, since
their building of good Houses & increase of Property, do not seem satisfied with the foregoing Customs & in two or three Instances they have made
Wills to divide their Possessions & Improvements among their Children. this is a Natural Consequence of an advance toward Civilization & must
obtain more place among them. The Gun & other things were formerly buried with the Deceased, but latterly this custom is much Discontinued. -- They
believe in the Ressurection of the Spirit but not of the Body & that for some Time after Death it is common for it to Ascend & Descend. in order
therefore for its accommodation, as altho perhaps from motives of Decency & Respect, a Tomb is erected over the Graves, sometimes formd with logs
& having a Roof of Bark -- at others it is Constructed with Boards & the Roof of the same- it made in this way, a small hole, phps the size of a
key hole is cut at the Head of the Tomb both above & below to allow Ingress & Egress to the Departed Spirit-- This Custom continues-- Already in
Degree, it is taking place when Friends first came among them they had one common field & altho' each planted his particular spot, there were many
Idlers who partook the labour of the more Industrious-- They now clear their particular spots of land where choice induces them & build themselves
comfortable Houses. these Improvements if they incline to leave (as they sometimes do in order to settle else where) are sold to such as incline
to purchase & altho' the Fee in the Soil cannot be Conveyd Being the property of the Nation yet Improvements so sold are considered the Property of
the Purchaser  who without molestation enjoys his priveledge-- The first sale of this Kind was considered an innovation & made considerable stir
but it is now done without objection & is no Small stimilus to Individual exertion. -- It sometimes happened formerly that as but Indians who were
disabled from Hunting by Infermity being tird of Life would request to be buried alive, a Grave or Hole was then dug in which a seat was formed in
the Digging the Antient Indian was then let down & taking his last seat the other Indians began to fill in the Earth doing it very gently &
tenderly till it had risen to his Chin. a Pause was then made and some ceremony used, after which the Young Warriors threw in the Dirt very
hartily so as to prevent their being Witnesses to his Struggles & to terminate his sufferings as speedily as might be. The Indian Men formerly
pluckd out their Beards as also the Hair from their Heads except a Tuft on the Crown which was left to grow pretty long. In time of War this was
laid hold of by an Enemy who had the Power, & the Skin to which it was attached severd with a Knife & this they denominated scalping-- The
Instrument use in plucking  the Head & Beard was found by twisting a Wire of the Common Knitting Needle Size on a piece of round hard Wood about
1/2 an Inch in Diameter & two Inches in length. On the Wood being withdrawn the Wire forms a spring or Kind of Pinchers & being applied to the
Face or Head & then pressd with the thumb & Finger at each end, took such fast hold of the Hairs which had inserted themselves between the wires
when a little open, they were readily extracted by the Roots. This Investment is light of carriage & will last an Age. Plucking the Hair from their
Heads is now Discontinued, and in many Instances the Younger Men Shave their Beards. Indian Parents commonly give their Children names significant
of something in Nature, as Corn Planters name in the Indian Language is Ky ea'twech'Che. Conudin, signifies a handsome Lake. Agish'quat'take is
Dry Much. Oendo, means the first ripe Corn. these Names are Changed occasionally in Consequence of remarkable Circumstance on taking place, or of
particular Employments or acts of Individuals & latterly some of these Class & Children have taken & appear pleased, with being named after white
People. They are not Delicate in their Eating, but will feast, apparently with a relish, on Meat much tainted & even peopled with Inhabitants &
sometimes almost rotten. -- they are very Jealous of encroachments on the rights & Priviledges of each other & Offences of this Nature have often
given occasion for War between Nations. When such Offences Occur they hold private Councils & if they determine to engage, they endeavour to do it
by Surprize. Such as excel in Artifice & courage are appointed their Chiefs & have the management of their War Concerns. They generally paint
themselves Red, but on some occasions streaks of Black are intermixed. Painting with Red, tho' expressive of War, is also used to denote
cheerfulness so & sometimes to hide the true expression of the Countenance, & in this way, when rubbed round the Eye, it has a Wonderful Effect. it
also makes them look fierce - Black mostly denotes Trouble -- In their Marches They are as Careful as possible to conceal their Tracks & to make
very little Fire in order to prevent its being discovered that a Multitude has passed. when engaged they are very Fierce, scalping those whom they
kill, & taking Prisoners all they can-- these are taken home with them & arranging before the Council where it is Determined which should be Put
to torture & which preserved alive, -- the latter are sometimes adopted in Families in the place of Relatives who have been killd in the War-- in
such Cases they are treated here by & often only in marriage with the nation receiving them. - They are very fond of ornaments & among the Woman
particularly Silver Brouches. TS told us that he once  saw 700 of these on one Garment. When an Indian believes he has received an Injury he is
never satisfied without Revenge and if he cannot obtain it on the aggressor he seeks to do it on some of the same tribe or family - to illustrate
this Disposition, I may here relate an Account that was given me of an old Indian Man on the Allegany River whom I saw and shook hand with, who
passes among them by the name of Stiff Arms. In an Indian War many years since, when he was young he was shot in an Engagement thro' both his
arms - tho Ball passing near the Elbows entirely disabled him for resistance he thought it necessary to make his repeat - in this situation it
seems likely he would have perished but some of his own Tribe found and took care of him feeding him for a long time and dressing his Wound.
Hostiliies between the contending parties being by this time over, himself and his Tribe returned home, the thoughts of  the injury he had
sustained Rankled in his mind & he endeavored for a considerable time to prevail with some of his friends to go with him to there notion by when
he was wounded to make celabration, but the distance was so long (being I think about three thousand miles) and the danger of the understanding
so great that they would not join him - unwilling to relinquish his design he set out above & travaild till he reachd the Border of his Enemy -
he then stripd himself naked & for several days & night lay in the wood & corn field in the vicinity of the Enemies Town, watching to catch some
of them who might be separated from the next - by observation he at length found that the warriors had gone away on an expedition of hunting or
war & on entering the village he killed & scalped a woman & two children & immediately made his Retreat, travelling into the wilderness night &
day with the greatest expedition he was capable of till almost famishd -after extreme hardships endurd he at length reached home & says he then
left satisfied, - he still relates the circumstance with great apparent satisfaction - says he thinks he did right & that if he had not obtaind
revenge he never should have felt easy- However desparately cruel this act may appear to the Christian, and in a rational view however unjust that
the innocent should be made to suffer for the Guilty, yet great allowance is to be made for the unfetterd Indian who by Education is taught to
believe that the Revenge for an aggression is a Duty -that the family or the tribe, are implicated with the individual aggressor and that if he
falls in obtaining his desire, he will undoubtedly Die happy- mo 20th staid about home & employd part of the time down five feet deep in a Mound in
the Field under an apprehension that it had once been an Indian place of internment but in this we were disappointed. we however found a number of
Pebble stones which on breaking often presented us the impression of marine shells - were also thrown a Flint stone taken from the River those
involving a shell of their kind  and about this House & premises there are large rough stones suitable for building which are apparently composed
entirely of marine shells & a kind of Earth or Clay in a Petrified state they told in that in the copy of the Mountains, which is here near us & in
full view, are abundance of stone of this description & that Petrifaction is very common & discoverable in various ways throughout this Mountaneous
Country- that wherever this Petrification prevails the inhabitants are subject to the complaint before mentioned of a Swelling in the Throat, here
denominated the Guitar - 21st & 5th of the Week - sat with the Family in their Week Day meeting - after Dinner the Indian Runner who went with our
Message to Cattaraugus came in, having been quite to Buffalo, calld of 5 miles by the Indian Path - he left their town on first Day about Eleven
oclock & returned to it about the same hour having performed the journey wholly on foot in 11 Days - being about 150 Miles- he brought a  short
letter from Jacob Taylor an Extract from which I insert as it shows the place Jacob has with the indians and also touches on their improvement --
Buffelow creck June 19th 1809 Respt Friends I have now a short oppy to note that I arrived here last sixth day at the pressing request of the
allegany and Cattarauguy Chiefs, to attend a council of the six nations. I find the principle Business is to adopt some permanent measure to
prevent any more Sales of their Lands &c. The War Department are mostly in favour of the Plan, & I rather think it will be car ried into effect -
they have received their presents a few Days since at this place from the U.S. & I think I never saw so many Indians together that conduct ted
with so much propriety - the num ber could not be well ascertained but it was thought there were about One Thou sand, and I dont remember to see
One Drunken Indian amongst them - I believe Wool & other Articles we shall want can be obtained at this place - The Agents says he will furnish the
Cattaragus Indians with Wheels, or Unite in any Measure proper to forward the Object of Improvement - the Chief Warriors wife has learnd to spin
tolerably well, and  intends to purchase a Wheel of her own & commence Spin'g after Corn Harvest - 22d, & 6th Day - We have had summer Weather
since being here & to Day several fine Showers being the first Rain of Consequence that we have seen since leaving home. In the Evening Jacob
Taylor arrived here having rode from Cattaraagus to Day- he informs that the Indians propose being home tomorow giving us a hearing in council on
first Day. Jacob was very entertaining this Evening in some encouraging accounts of Indian Improvement & relating some Annecdotes of their
Discernment & Talents. he also read us an Indian Letter to the Agent of the US for the six Nations on Indian Affairs. being as follows- TusKarora

that it lies on the East side of the Allegany River at the Distance of about half a mile. is bounded on that side being the West by the Indian
Preservation & on the East by Sands of the Holland Compy. of whom it was purchased about the year 1803. for $1.25 cents p Acre and contains 692
Acres- about 60 of which is cleard and perhaps 22 of the 60 may be Calld Meadow or bottom Sand, lying on the Tunassasa Creek which runs thro' its
part of this Meadow is considerably Improved & very good (say 12 Acres) the rest is capable of being made so, and will all bear culture with the
Plow. The Cleard Upland produces well but is not the most fertile- the residue mostly well Timberd with W Pine, Hemlock, Beech, Birch, Sugar Maple
&c. The House is  pleasantly situate fronting the South, on an agreeable Eminence and commands a view of the Meadows, Creek, Race, Tanyard, Saw &
Griste Mills Cowpen, Piles of Boards &c. these are incompassed by Wood, & to the South West is a considerable Mountain containing Petrified

comfortable one, suited with Judgement for the occasion. Its Inhabitants are a very clever Company, each filling, or, and believe sincerely

Morning toward the Town to know whether Council was to be held to Day, bu on his Way was met by J.P. one of the Indian Chiefs who was coming to
inform us that it was deferrd till tomorrow we were therefore at liberty to stay at home & sat with the Family in then usual ways. After Dinner a
Couple of Indian Girls (one of them Cornplanters Daughter) came to learn respecting the propriety of continuing the Practice of Grinding for them
instructing in the various arts of Housewifery on this Day of the Week- me own opinion is that it is time to shew a discountenance as preparatory
to a total discontinuance others of the Committee do not appear to be like minded supposing the Indians to be not yet ripe on account of their
prejudices & want of Knowledge of Days- some of the Friends stationed here have for some time been uneasy. & other think the indulging Indians in
this respect is unavoidable. I hope eventually all will work right. Yesterday the Committee with Friends of This Family agreed upon a address to
the Indians being previously drawn up by TS since being here- in substance being- I wish to remind them of Frnd continued care toward and regard
for them. their starting that we had from vicios their Farms & raised improvements & had felt desires for their farther advancement in every good
Work. next that if they men would do more Work on their Farms & would encourage their Wives & Daughters in learning to spin, Weave &c. Our belief
was that they would devise great advantage from it- That Jon Thomas was willing to weave for them, free of Cost for one year, provided 2 or 3 of
their women, in that time, would learn to Weave, but if they neglected this The benefit designd by his thus instructing them would not fully answer
our wishes- Their custom of Husbands & Wives separating was next love to upon & our sense thereon conveyed that such a practice was displeasing to
the Great Spirit- & often left their Childen in Poverty & Distress - We also expressd a Desire that they would think very seriously indeed before
they condemnd & Killd any for supposing them guilty of Witchcraft reminding them that about 100 years since such a practice prevaild in one
neighbourhood among White People & before put a stop to, some of those who had been judges of others, were themselves changed with the same often
is & executed. On these two subjects desiring their Careful Consideration but not wishing a reply at this Time that they would avail themselves of
every advantage to be derived from our Friends living among them while they continued here - That they had seen the bad effects of playing cards &
other games & that altho' these was an Impressment these was yet room for more, & if their principal Chiefs & wise men would discourage the
Practice we thought a we would arise to their Young People - That our friends had lived with their many years in Harmony & Friendship - if any
part of our conduct towards them had not been quite to their wishes we desired they would speak their minds freely & let us know - Dated 9 mo 25th
1809 & Signd by A Lea, Jno Brown, T Stew & WA 25th After Breakfast set out to attend the Council of Cold Spring - I stopd in at several Houses on
our way to the Town to Shake hands with the Indians then went to the Council House with is a Building nearby the Centre of the Town about 40 feet
in length & 20 in breadth. having a Door at each End  and two Holes in the Peak of the Roof to admit the ascending of the Smoke from Council Fires
- which are built on the Ground about 12 feet from each Door.- These fires are daily used by the Inhabitants for cooking on other purposes, being
a kind of public Priveledge the Open Doors admitting ready Impress & Egress to them at pleasure- the floor is laid by nature and on each side from
one End to the other is a platform laid coverd with Board, Skins &c. about 6 feet in width & 10 Inches in heighth- over these all the heighth of 5
feet under other Platforms which serve to throw up skins Corn or any Lumbering articles & to the Rafters was suspended a quantity of old Corn some
of it near the Openings in the Roof being as black as smoke Could make it - this they dont mind but use it for making Bread & other purposes
perhaps preferring it as I observed in their Houses generally the Corn was stored by suspending it with the Husk this way - as The Indians were not
generally collected it afforded opportunity to make some observations. Conudius House stand the nearest to the Council House & within a few Yards-
Our attention was here averted by the sound of music & Dancing & feeling some inclination to be witnesses we were informed that it would give no
offence & so went inside of the Door - In the Middle of the Room lay the Hommany Block & an Old Bench apparently designd to prevent an encroachment
on that part of the floor & to preserve regularity of Circuit sound them those rude Regulators were encompassd by 18 & 20 Females (occasionally
more) some Elder  Elderly Women & down to Girls about 10 years of age- these forming a Circle were Dancing (or shuffling) round sideways with a
slow & solemn motion, & Heads uniformly reclining to the sound of Musick performd by a Man in one corner of the Room. this was done by beating
slowly on a Drum made by a Dried Deer or some other Kind of Skin dressd a little in the manner of Parchment & tightly strechd over the Top of a
Churn. or sometimes we were told an Iron Pot- they said he bent with two sticks & the sound of one of them put me in mind of tinkling symbols,
being, either hollow & enclosing something of the trikling kind or else havg some small bells attachd to it. but it was so dark where he sat that
I could not see- this sound he accompanied with a vocal Time or perhaps a song, but if the latter his articulation was very indistinct - it
however appeard to be in stanza at the end of which the female circle would cease their Dancing & walk round with a quicker motion & some
appearance of Hilarity till after a circle or two, another Stanza began. this Dance & music continued for abt 2 Hours after we were there & the
Dancers would step out occasionally dripping with Perspiration (apparently to cool & getair) & then return again- they were much in then usual
Dress except the Children several of whom lookd clean & Dressed for the occasion one in white Cloth- another Green a third Blue &c.- and there had
each a bunch of  small Bells hung to the Knee & made a noise as they Danced not much unlike the singing of Secrets- a few of them were a little
touchd with Paint- when the Dance was over they had a Feast being a kind of soup or sand-compon we were told of new corn shelld from the Cob- a
little meat, sugar &c. & was boild in the Council House in a large Kettle. this being carried into Coundius one of each family engagd in the Dance
& who had previously (we were told) contributed, refraind with their small kettles or Wooden Bowls to receive their shares-. After waiting for
some Time an Antient Indian blew a Trumpet to notify the Inhabitants of Council & they began to assemble- They were dressd of ornamented variously
many were painted with red streaks about the face Head & Eyes as fancy inclined- some had Bandages of Indian Workmanship round their Heads & tufts
of Feathers of different columns. Sometimes Furs. The Hair of some was shorn round the Crown & left long round the Temples & on the Top of the
Head- others had it left long in little Tufts over the Head & those Tufts plaited - many had Breast plates of Different fancies- others back
Ornaments & Ear Bobbs all of silver One had one Red Legging & the other Blue- some Caps of Fur with Tufts of Dyed Freathers or Caps of Feathers &
& Tips of Fur other tails of long Hair like Horse Hair Dyed Red hanging down their Backs or erected or suspended from their Ears- Old Conidin  has
a blaze of vermillion from the Corner of each Eye- his Ears were cut round in their manner & extended to a considerable length on each Ear were two
silver Quills- one about 3 1/2 & the other 2 Inches the erect one having a Tuft of Red Feathers stuck in at the lower End- part of his Forehead &
on his Crown were also painted red & being nearly bald & a very grave countenance he lookd venerable- On his arms were wider silver Bracelets- his
Leggings were of Red Cloth & his Covering a Blanket over all which he threw off in Council & look up his long Pipe They had a very great variety
of other ornaments & trinkets such as Nose Bobs & Plates resembling Furniture for Drawers- silver band round their Arms wrists or Ankles &c. &c. &
yet in a general way very Dirty & careless in their Persons- One of the Chiefs was Dressd in a Wood Rangeres Frock & many of them had no
ornaments- John Peirce (who is a Chief) was the only one among them who thought it worth while to appear on this occasion in a Full Dress- He is
Tall & a good Person- Had a new White Hat on with a high crown which was coverd from the Brim to the top with a bandage of Green Flowred silk- in
front were two bunches or Knots of Green Ribbons displayd with taste one above the other & on one side of them a Tuft of Dyed Feathers of Different
Colours- He wore a new Coat of a neatly figured green Calico  made a little in the manner of a Frock & the Boson Raffled with the same. his Leg
coverings or Pantaloons were in the Indian manner with a seam sewed out leaving a ship of about am Inch & Quarter. this strip or Edging on each Leg
was faced with blue Silk, neatly wrought with needlework of Blue ornamented with Red twines or Curls- and edged with Beads in the Indian Stile-
Instead of a Blanket his Outer Covering was about a yard & half of super fine White Cloth which in Council he threw off from his Shoulders at
pleasure. young Fatty. another Chief was pretty Dirty - the Hair was shorn on the sides of his Head but from the crown down the neck was left to
grow in the antie quite long & was pleated down his Back in a large Plait- on each side of this the Hear was left about 4 Inches long & being soft
course & glossy resembled a ship of black Feathers- The Council having at length taken their seats we were introduced & seated near the centre- The
Chiefs present were Cornplanter- Tekiando (his Nephew) Johnson Silver heels- John Peirce, Tusenda quit (or young fatty)or Tockewassee (or go to
War) Jacob Snow  & Old Conudin- several of them are handsome Men- Cornplanter has an Expressive countenance & penetrating Eyes, but owing to some
cause either habit or Injury, he keeps one of them about half shut - after a little Time of silvence & then a Conference between the Chiefs Conudiu
opend the Business for which we had met & that they were now ready to hear;- Our communications  were then read & interpretted to them, & after a
little further conference among themselves cornplanter made a Reply first to us & then an address to the Indians in a methodical & sensible manner-
when our Business was got this base their farewell & returnd home. 26th 26th Left the settlement of our Friends at Tunasassa about 10 oClock Jacob
Taylor accompanying us- J B Moses & myself keeps with [hemion?] the West side of the Allegany in order to go by the Indians Saw Mill which in
about 10 miles from their Town- On our way passd several Indian Plantations as good we thought as any we had seen, particularly an Indian named
Kah'Shun'Lee' on the Fiery flying Dragon- his Wife was Dressd in a Silk Short Gown wearing a large silver cross at her Breast- these the Indians
have got from the Roman Catholics originally but are now worn only by way or ornament Kah shun dee was hawlg oats of which we saw a considerable
Crop standing in the build in a neat shock. He had a large Barn (which Jacob told us was maid with his own Hands). & in it is considerable
quantity of Old Corn & Grain of Different Kinds a part of which we saw- on passing pay- he is Industrious & Wealthy- not fond of attending their
feasts & Councils and declines the appointment of a Chief our course after leaving Peter Snyders was  nearly N West. here we bid adieu to the
Allegany & passg this a Rich Country, reachd Stephen Hazeltines before 4 oClock calld 20 miles from Tunasassa, Road Rough & mud 27th 27th our Bed,
last night not being calculated to Induce a morning Indulgence we rose before Day eat our Breakfasts & set off before it was light- in a little way
Riding fell into the Indian Path which we pursued upwd of 20 miles & take it all together perhaps the worst Road we have passd over any Day
before- Moses concluded that after this he should not be afraid of any sort of Road & I thought while riding on a long sideling Hill which really
seemd Dangerous I should be wishing our Friends at home should have a peep at us, could they have also had an assurance that we should get thro
this safely, as was the care not by our own might or management but under the protecting care of the Omnipotent Arm for which may our
acknowledgements were as acceptable Incence to Him. -- part of our Way was up the little Valley then across the Broad Mountain 5 miles over &
next the Hog back Mountain 6 miles over- on this for miles our path lay on the Crown of the Hill & the descent immediately & in some places steep,
on either hand- We also several times forded Cattarangus Creek in its Different branches & then the main Creek- The soil rode even to Day has been
generally good & the Timber  fine even on the Mountains- here we saw Chestnut Trees which we supposed 6 & of feet over (perhaps more)- also
Poplars, Hemlock, Sugar Maples, Ash, Cucumber Trees, Beech &c. very large- near the main Catt. Creek lay a body of sand much coverd with Black
Walnut & as rich as Bank Meadow- about the middle of our Journey we fed our Horses & eat a biscuit at a place of Indian Encampment & before this
had passd as Grave enclosd in the Indian manner where Jacob told us a man was buried who perished in the Woods about 4 years ago on his way from
Buffaloe to Cold Spring- his Horse first Died & himself about 8 miles further- was warnd before setg out of the Danger of Perishing but said he was
so much like Iron there was no Danger- We also met an Indian on Horseback from Grand River going to see the Allegany Indians, to some of whom he
was related- Jacob talkd with him, informg our Business &c. - He replied in substance that he was pleasd with meeting us- & with the Business we
were engagd in, and wishing us preservation & safety on our  Journey bade us favourable- a few miles further we met another man on Horseback named
Pollard) from Buffaloe. he had a small Child before him & his Wife (we supposed) on another Horse behind. she was well dressd & her neck ornamented
with silver Broaches so as to give it the appearance at a little Distance of a richly silverd Shawl It had not felt quite pleasant to me that we
made no return to the Salutation & friendly wish of the first Indian & this one also Greeting us in a similar way. I desired Jacob to tell him
that we were pleasd with meeting him on his Way to visit his Friends at Allegany and brighten the Chain of Friendship- if he could also encourage
them in useful Industry it would be a good Work- he recieved it Cordially & we passd on- Jacob told us he was an Industrious Man & one of the
greatest Farmers among the Indians in that Country. before 4 oclock reachd the settlements of our Friends at Clear Creek  calld 25 Miles from
Hazeltines & after takg some Refreshment spent the Eveng in viewg the Farm & Improvements 28th went to see the Indians Improvements. our way,
except about a Quarter of a mile being  50 on their Reservation which is very Rich Land & well Timberd but (as if it were designd for Indians who
have not yet learnd to labour there are many hundred Acres of Flats without a Tree, being coverd with Fern, Wild Grass, Strawbery vines (which in
their season [been?] abundantly) and rich herbage in some place as high as our heads on Horseback- the soil is black when wet & new when Dry
resembling Ashes- the Timber adjoining & bordering on it White & blk oak- black Walnut, Sugar Maple &c. - on the open Plains were many Houses
feeding, belonging to the Indians in about 5 miles riding we came to the Village of the Muncy Indians, who are a part of the Delaware Tribe & about
152 in number the Cataraagas settlement of Senecas is about one mile further & they are about 250 Persons We stopd at the House of the Chief
Warrior named Wyundegohta whose store House we found pretty well supplied with wheat, oats,old corn&some of his Warrior employed in shilg new corn
which they had previously parched this is to be dried in the sun & as wanted for use, to be pounded & mixed with sugar, and is an excellent
nutritious & portable food for travelling- We here saw many Ornaments in their Way. One Head Dress made with long Feathers wrapd on the sides of
the Head with white skin of some animal ornamented with the skin of a Drakes Head in spots. the Feather part stuck out behind being highly
coloured, & over the Forehead was the Head & beak of a Bird (perhaps a Raven) on each side of which from the Eye was a Tuft of long Crim son
coloured Feathers. At the side of the Room being a string of Half Moons of 4 in Number, all of Silver, the largest (wh they said cost 6 Dollars)
being on the Top & so regularly becoming [On after?] as they went to the bottom- on each was an ingraving of some bird or animal- One pt of Musical
Leg Ornaments composd of Dyed Feathers & worn in these Dances- a pair of Mockasins richly wrought with Porcupine Quills & tipd with a very great
number of silver Quills many other things rich in their way- The Sand on which these two villages stand, perhaps 15 or 20 Acres in each is
beautifully coverd with white Clover, Green Grass &c. & if it were inclosed & Kept up for Mowing we thought would cut the first crop near two Tons
per acre. After stageing here a while & leaving it with them to fix a time when to receive us in Council we rode about two miles further down the
Cataraugus Creek to see the Indians corn & oats &c. the Crops are not very good owing to several causes the principal are poor cultivation, yet the
Sand is superlatively good- those Flatts, containing many Thousand Acres contain in their Bowels strong months of being made Ground- as we rode
along the Creek on the opposite side an Island is now forming, while the bank on which we were is washing away & as the Depth of 10 or 12 feet the
Logs are sticking out of the Bank into the Creek bearing the marks of having been there buried for a long series of years- On returning to the 
village we rode about half a mile & forded the Catarinugus Creek to the Indians saw mill - here we rode out of the main creek into the Bed of the
small creek which the mill is built on - the bottom of which is a slate rock -on about 80 or 100 yards we came to the spring mentd the 18th Ult an
indian had a accompanied us with a fire brand on the application of whichto the Effluvium arising it immediately burnt into a Blasett burned with
considerable heat as long as we inclined to view it & would have continued to burn as we were told till extinguished by a sudden Dash of water or
blow of wind - I dashed afraid of it out with water pour the creek but almost as soon as I had done the air caught again then took his hat & blew
it quite out. The Rock in this place is cracked across in several directions & the Babbling appears in the centre, where is the largest opening, at
this place is first caught but soon extended itself for several feet along the other cracks the flame emitting a sulpherous Effluvia, mixed with
some other smell- the Water in the Creek was now very low, but Jacob told us that when the Spring was coverd with the Creek as it often was it
produced a much larger Flame than we saw- At a small Distances from this Spring Jacob told us there was an Antient Fortification containing about
