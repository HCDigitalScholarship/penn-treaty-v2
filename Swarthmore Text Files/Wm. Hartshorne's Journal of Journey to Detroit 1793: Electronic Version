 On First Day the 4th of the 5th Mo 1793 at
 9 o'clock in the evening left New York in order
 to attend the Treaty to be held with the Indians
 at Sandusky, near the West end of Lake Erie. Our company who were going the same
 rout consisted of Jacob Lindley , William Savery ,
 Rich'd Hillary , a young Englishman, John Hackenwelder , a Minister among the
 Moravians, Dr. William McCoskry , and Captain
 Scott, Commissary to the Commissioners.
 We had an indifferent passage
 up the river, part of the way being
 in the Night, and arrived at Albany on the 8th,
 about 5 in the morning.- Albany appears
 to be a place of considerable trade, some of
 the Houses are well Built, the streets mostly
 paved, but some of them very narrow and
 irregularly laid out -- here the Low Dutch
 Language is generally spoken, and the
 manners of the inhabitants not esteemed
 very pleasing. At Albany we found General 
Lincoln, one of the commissioners, and ChS Stover,
 their Secretary -- upon our arrival with the
 Stores, General Lincoln was desirous of going
 immediately to Schenectady, and with considerable
 difficulty, and many hours delay, at length
 procured a Horse and Chair, and without an
 Attendant, about 6 in the Evening, set off for that
 that place -- we tarried all night and
 found very indifferent entertainment. 9th. Having procured Waggons we left Albany
 about 8 A.M. and went to Schenectady were
 we arrived about 11 -- Schenectady lays about
 l6 ½ miles N.W. from Albany, is a pretty well
 built handsome inland Town, a place of con-
siderable Trade, being the carrying place between
 the Mohawk and Hudson's Rivers -- here, as at
 Albany, the language is Low Dutch. – The Land
 between Albany and Schenectady is Sandy & poor,
 Timbered chiefly with Pine.- At Schenectady
 we found prepared for us Eight Boats or Batteaux,
 Six for the Baggage and Stores, that would carry about
 a Ton and a half each, and two larger with
 Awnings for the passengers: We embarked in our
 Boat about 4 P.M. and proceeded seven miles up the Mo-
hawk River to Mabee’s, where we lodged. 10th. We proceeded up the River 15 miles & encamp’d
 near the remains of old Fort Hunter; two or three
 miles below which we passed by the place formerly
 the residence of Sir William Johnson – We found
 the stream this day very rapid – the Land
 on the Banks of the River between this & Schenectady
 being very beautiful and fertile – the high Land at a
 distance appearing more rough and uncultivated. 11th. Embark’d about sunrise, with a fair Wind,
 and having most of the way a gentle current,
 we hoisted our sails and run 20 miles up
 the River to Col. Fry ’s, where we dined, a few
 miles below we pass’d by a place call’d Fort
 Plane, where is a handsome Worship House and other
 good Buildings –- After Dinner proceeded 8 miles
 to Nellis’s Tavern where we lay all Night.- At
 this place were inform’d we were but
 15 miles from the Waters of Susquehanna, and
 about 40 from Delaware - 

 Dutch- Our way this day being through a
 most beautiful and fertile country -- the
 Inhabitants between this and Schenectady are being
 mostly low Dutch. 12th. Got to the Little Falls about Noon (call'd 60 miles
 from Schenectady) -- here is a carrying Place of
 about one Mile -- the Falls altogether are about
 40 feet, preparations are now making to
 render them navigable by Locks -- along these
 Falls are fine mill seats, on one of which John
 Porteous Esqr has erected a very good Grist Mill & saw
 Mill -- Jacob Lindley and myself were kindly
 entertained by Major de Zeng , superintendent of
 the Canal business at this place. 13th. Got our Boats goods, &ca. above the Falls
 and proceeded up the River about 6 miles
 to a place call'd Fort Herkimar, or the German
 Flatts -- The Country hereabout being very
 very beautiful, and has the appearance of great
 fertility -­ the inhabitants chiefly the descendants
 of Germans by whom the high Dutch Language is
 mostly spoken. 14th. In our progress this day we found the Country
 but thinly inhabited, but we were informed the
 number of settlers were rapidly increasing
 principally by immigration from New England
 and there is every reason to believe that in a few
 years it will become well cultivated and plentiful
 -- in the evening we stopt at Fort Schuyler
 24 miles from Fort Herkimar. 15th. After breakfast several of us went 4 miles
 up the River on foot to Whites Town, the residence
 of Arthur Breese , to whom I had letters -- it
 is quite a new settlement but has the appear-
ance of becoming a place of note, being
 situated in a fast improving Country, and
 has already in it large Stores, and the finest
 Pot Ash works that we have yet seen -- at 4
 P.M. stopt at Baron Steuben 's Landing on the
 North side of the River, from which to his House
 we were inform'd the distance was 7 miles
 and 9 to Fort Stanwix.- At 7 in the evening
 arrived at the Carrying Place at Fort Stanwix. 16th. The situation of Fort Stanwix, (although upon
 a 1evel plain, almost surrounded by low Marshey
 Land), must be very much elevated, as it
 lays about half way between the Mohock &
 Wood Creek, the first taking an eastern course
 to the sea, the latter running Westerly to the
 Lakes.­ We were inform 'd a Town was
 laid out near the old Fort, and that preparations
 ware making to erect Buildings.- a Canal
 is intended to be out perhaps the ensuing Summer
 from the Mohock to Wood Creek.- The price of
 Land on from the Mohock from the German Flatts
 to Fort Stanwix we were told was from 2
 Dollars to 20 pr Acre, according to the quality
 and State of cultivation.- The course from
 Schenectady to Fort Stanwix, I suppose to be
 about W.N.W., distance by water about 120
 miles.- this day got our batteaux &ca.
 over to Wood Creek-- Wood Creek at this place
 being no more than a shallow Brook of
 about 10 or 12 feet wide. 17th. About 7 this morning, having previously
 hoisted the Gates of a Mill Dam a little above the
 batteaux floated down the Creek,- One Waggon
 Load of Goods, and another with passengers, going
 by Land down to Canada Creek -- 4 miles below
 Fort Stanwix is the remains of Fort Bull, opposite
 to which on the South side of Wood Creek is the N.E. corner of the Oneida reserve
 seven
 seven miles below Fort Stanwix is Canada Creek
 opposite to the mouth of which, on the South side
 of Wood Creek is the remains of Fort Ricky -- the Land between
 Fort Stanwix and Canada Creek is low & marshy,
 much inferior to that on the Mohock -- The
 Timber consists of large *Maple, Birch, Beach,
 Pine &ca., no Oak or Chestnut as yet
 to be seen.– at 6 in the evening encamped
 at a place call'd the Oak Orchard, 18 miles by
 water from Fort Stanwix.- here is a high spot
 on which are a few Oak Trees – the Land below
 Canada Creek appears much better than that above
 -- the Timber, Maple, Butternut, Poplar, Beach,
 Ash, Elm, Lindon (or Bass Wood), and some Oak
 -- very little Pine or Hemlock.- On the Banks
 of the River are considerable quantities of wild
 Hops, equal to any in the Brewing business. 18th. About 6 A.M. embark'd and proceeded down
 the Creek to the Oneida Lake, being about 18 miles
 -- the Land on the sides of the Creek being much
 the same as that below Canada Creek.- The Course
 from Fort Stanwix to the Mouth of Wood Creek on the
 Oneida Lake, I suppose to be about W.b.S., the
 distance by water 36 miles, and by Land about
 18 miles. - About 2 P.M. the Wind blowing fresh
 to the Westward, we pitched our Tents on the Bank
 near the Mouth of Wood Creek -- Here we were *N.B. Whenever I speak of Maple sugar Maple is meant. visited by Col Lewis , Beach Tree, and Captain
 John, three chiefs of the Oneida Indians -- a
 very sensible speech was delivered by Beach Tree,
 a grave old man, in which he congratulated
 Gen'l Lincoln on his arrival, and express'd his
 hearty concurrence with the Commissioners in
 the object of their mission, saying he was an
 old Man and very near the Grave, and as the
 Work of peace was a good work, the few remain-
ing Days he had to Live should all be spent
 in the promotion of it.- Captain John 
 made a short speech to the same effect, and
 also express'd his particular satisfaction in
 seeing a number of Friends on their way to
 the Treaty.- Wood Creek runs into the Oneida
 Lake near the East end, the Land upon the N.
 side appears low and level, the Timber Pitch
 Pine intermixed with Oak and other wood, the
 soil whereon we encamp'd sandy and poor.
-On the south side the Country wore a more
 pleasant & fertile appearance with a range
 of high hills at a considerable distance to the
 South East, from which to the Lake, the
 Land appeared well Timbered and level--
 It falling calm in the evening we struck
 our Tents and embark'd about 7 and proceeded down
 down the Lake,- a fair Wind springing
 up about Midnight, we arrived about 4
 A.M. at the entrance of the Onandago or Oswego
 River, near the remains of Fort Brewerton
--our Passage being all the way in the Night
 can give no further description of the Lake
–-the Course from the mouth of Wood Creek
 being about WbN., the distance 30 miles –
 the width of the Lake being from 7 to 9
 miles. 19th. Left Fort Brewerton about 7 o’clock in the
 morning and proceeded with the current 18
 miles to where the Seneca unites with the Onan-
dago River, at a place call’d the three points, here
 we found a settlement, stopt and got our Dinners
 –- the Land on both sides very low, some
 appearing good, other but indifferent –- the
 Timber Oak, shag bark Hickory, Maple, Ash,
 Beach, Birch, Pine &ca.- about 4 P.M. proceeded
 down to the Falls of Oswego, and encamp’d on the
 North side near the Falls.- We have found plenty
 of Fish ever since we enter'd the Onondago River --
 saw Cat Fish at Fort Brewerton that would weigh 15 to
 20 lb.- and a very good Fish they call Black Bass.
 --at the Falls we purchased of some Indians
 very excellent Salmon –- The River at the Falls is
 about 200 yards wide, and the Fall over the Rock
 about 8 feet perpendicular – the Course of the
 River at the Falls about N.N.W. –- The Banks
 of the River higher near the Falls than at the
 entrance of the River – on the South side the
 Land appears fertile, and the banks about 40
 feet high, on the N. side the bank not so high
 nor the land so good. 20th. Drag’d our Batteaux, without unloading
 them, about 60 yards on the Land, and launched
 them into the River just below the Falls, from whence
 to the distance of about One Mile, the River is very
 Rapid and not without the appearance of danger
 – we found several other Rapids in our way
 down to Oswego Fort, where we arrived about
 2 P.M. – the distance from Fort Brewerton
I think about 36 miles by water. – Oswego
 is pleasantly situated on a high point on the
 East side of the River, having the Lake to the
 North. – We were kindly entertained by Capt.
 Wickham the British Commander, during the
 few hours we staid, with whom we dined
 – having no tidings of any Vessell to carry
 us to Niagara. General Lincoln determined
 to proceed on in our Batteaux, accordingly
 it being a fine Calm afternoon, about 4
 P.M. we went out upon Lake Ontario, and
 about 7 pitch’d our Tents upon the Beach
 about 15 miles from Oswego. 21st. It being a fine calm morning about
 8 o’Clock embark'd, and in the evening en-
camped at a place call'd the Apple Boom, a
 good harbour for Boats, about 40 miles from
 Oswego.- about 30 miles from Oswego on
 the south side of the Lake, is Great Sodus River
 a good harbour for Vessells. 22nd. Rain last night - in the morning a fresh
 Breeze about West which prevented our moving
 untill about 4 P.M. when we again Launch'd
 our Boats and proceeded about 7 miles, then
 landed and encamped on the Shore. 23rd. About 5 A.M. embark'd and went 6 miles,
 then landed and got breakfast, in the mean
 time a fair Wind sprung up which we,
 hoisting our Sails, made use of - about
 10 A.M. opposite the Mouth of Genesee River
 (here we saw a House, being the only settlement we discovered on the Lake) which is call’d 65 miles from Oswego – 10
 miles to the Westward of Genesee is Braddock’s
 Bay, where we stopt to dine – this appear’d
 to be the most pleasant spot we have as yet found upon
 the Lake – on both sides the Creek fine Meadows
 and the upland has the appearance of fertility
 – The Timber chiefly Oak, with some Chesnut
 Hickory and Maple.- The Bank of the Lake
 from Oswego to Braddocks Bay is mostly low,
 and level, not to exceed 40 feet in the highest places,
 --the Timber chiefly Hemlock, Maple, Birch,
 Beach &ca.- After dinner again proceeded
 on our Way, and about 8 P.M. encamp'd at
 a place called the Oak Orchard, being about
 50 miles from where we lay last night &
 40 from Niagara. 24th. About 8 A.M. embark'd with a fair Wind
 which encreas'd and blew hard about Noon,
 we were obliged to Land at a place call'd 18 mile
Creek.- The Land from Braddocks Bay to this
 place very low and swampy. - here we
 found a fine pleasant Bank 20 or 30 feet high, the
 soil tolerable good, covered chiefly with Oak
 Timber - while at this place we saw two Schooners pass by
 which we supposed were from Kingston, on
 the St.Lawrence, bound to Niagara - The
 wind continuing to blow hard we pitch'd
 our Tents. 25th. About 1 A.M. it being Calm, we
 again moved forward and about 6 arriv'd
 at the Fort of Niagara - the shore, the
 last 18 miles, being very pleasant, a level
 flat Bank about 20 feet high - the Timber
 which we take to be Oak appearing very
 tall and fine. - The distance from Oswego to
 Niagara as we coasted it, along the south side
 side of Lake Ontario, being reckoned 160 miles
 - Niagara Fort is very pleasantly situated on
 a high point of Land, having Lake Ontario on
 the North, and the Gut, or Niagara River on the
 west.- After having refresh'd ourselves at a
 Tavern in the Garrison, where the entertainment
 was but indifferent, and the Charge very high,
 we cross'd over the River to the New Town of
 Newark, Col. Pickering having previously
 engaged a House, wherein we could spread
 our Mattrasses, and Cook our Victuals. - when
 we landed at Niagara we found a Vessell with
 her Sails loose, and just on the point of sailing
 for Oswego, in order to bring us to Niagara 26th. - First day - Remained all day at New-
ark, which is situated nearly opposite to the
 Fort, the River, or Gut, between them being about
 three quarters of a Mile wide, the Town con-
tains about 20 houses, and others building
 – the Land in the vicinity but indifferent,
 much inferiour to that near the Fort – at
 this place we met with Governor Randolph 
 and Col. Pickering , the other two Commissioners
 who, with General Lincoln , the Secretary & Rich’d
 Hillery are entertain’d by Governor Simcoe .–
 At our arrival here we were inform’d the Indians
 Indians would not be ready to attend the
 treaty before the last of next month. 27th. In the morning before breakfast had a Visit
 from Governor Simcoe , who had some Conversation
 with Friends respecting the Militia Laws, and
 appeared very desirous that they might be so mo-
delled in this Government as to be as little oppressive
 as possible - about 8 A.M. embark'd in our Boats
 and at 11 Landed at the Kings Stores 9 miles from
 Niagara - the Banks on both sides, all the way
 up, being high and steep, and the shores very
 bold, so that there are but few places wherethat are
 convenient for Landing - to this place the River
 is navigable for large Vessells - here in the
 afternoon we had the satisfaction to meet
 with our Friends John Parish , Joseph Moore 
 and John Elliott , who came from Philadelphia
 in Company with Govern’r Rand olph & Col. Pickering 
 - Our Baggage, Stores, &ca. were deposited in
 the Kings Stores, and we pitch'd our Tents
 upon the Hill above the Landing, a number
 of soldiers lay in Huts on the low grounds
 below, who are very sickly, numbers dying
 daily with the Dysentery. 28th. Our small Batteaux were all dis-
charged and sent back to Schenectady - about
 about 11 this morning we were visited by
 Govr Simcoe , Govr Randolph , Col Pickering 
 &ca.-Governor Simcoe kindly offered us the use
 of his House, which stands empty among the
 Soldiers Huts at the foot of the Hill, but it being
 an unhealthy situation, we acknowledged his
 kindness, and abode in our Tents - The poor
 sickly Soldiers were also removed from this
 unhealthy spot, and encamp'd on the Top
 of a Hill, about half a Mile from us - this
 afternoon Jos. Moore & J. Lindley left us in order
 to visit some People in the Neighbourhood. 29th. Steady Rain the greatest part of the Day -
 some of our Company went down to Navy Hall to
 visit the Commissioners, where it was concluded
 that Friends, together with J.Hackenwelder and
 Dr. McCoskry might be at Liberty to proceed to
 Detroit, and there remain until the time
 of the Treaty. 30th. The Rain still continued all the last Night
 and the greatest part of this Day - Dr. McCoskry went
 down to Navy Hall and procured our passports to
 Detroit - in the evening we were joined by Jacb.
 Lindley, and had a visit from William Brandt 
 a Tuscarora Chief, who appear'd to be a sensible
 and well behaved Man - he resides at a Village
 about 3 miles from this place on the East Side
 of the River - J. Parrish , J. Elliott and W.Savery 
 removed their Mattrasses into a House on
 account of the Rain, the rest of us kept in our
 Tents in which we lay dry and comfortable.
 Some remarkable expressions which dropt
 from Governor Simcoe , in the Visit, mentioned in
 the Morning of the 27th, being omited in the proper
 place, are in substance as follows - He said that
 falsehoods had been intimated by American Com-
missioners at former treaties with the Indians, in
 respect to the British Government ceeding to the
 United States the absolute property of the Indian
 Country, as the price of Peace, - nothing more
 being intended by that Article of the Treaty, than
 the right of preemption, which he fully acknow
-ledged, and said that the British Government had no
 right to purchase Lands of the Indians within
 the limits mark'd out by the Treaty - He fur-
ther said that the Indians had been treated
 with cruelty and injustice, and that it was
 his opinion they never would make peace
 except the River Ohio was made the boundary
 line. - He further said that scandalous
 falsehoods had been propagated in the News
 papers of the United States, respecting the
 British still keeping possession of the West-
ern Ports, that the only reason was the
 the noncompliance of the United States with
 two Articles of the Treaty of Peace - let these
 Articles be complied with and the Forte shall
 be immediately complied with evacuated,
 and, he added, with some degree of warmth
 - I know the disposition of your people, - what
 signifies that Pidgeon House - pointing to the
 Fort - I know you can take it - it is not
 in the strength the place that I put my
 dependance, but it is in this, that we have
 Boston, New York and Philadelphia in
 Mortgage for your peaceable behaviour. 31st. Rain all these 24 hours almost without
 intermission - J. Heckenwelder and Doctr. MoCoskry 
 set off for Fort Erie in order to enquire after a
 passage to Detroit. - This day J.Moore join'd us,
 and we were visited by Captain Hendrick and
 some of the Stockbridge Indians, most of whom
 speak good English, and appear to be a civil well-
-behaved people. 6mo. 1st. This morning the Rain abated - took
 a walk up the River.- immediately from the
 Landing the Bank rises to the heigth of more than
 150 feet above the surface of the Water, - the
 range of high Land, extending each way from
 the River, about an East and West course - the Land
 below towards Lake Ontario, being a Level plain,
 the greatest part well-timbered and fertile, many
 beautiful settlements on the West bank of the
 River towards Newark. - the Land after
 rising the Hill above, towards Lake Erie,
 being also a plain level Country, equal in
 beauty and fertility to that below - as far
 as I could discover, the Banks of the River,
 from the Landing to the Falls, 
 of the heigth, perhaps from 150 to 200 feet,
are almost perpendicular, the greatest part
of solid Rock, it being the opinion of many,
 that the Falls were originally near the Landing, but the
 prodigious Body of Water that precipitates down
 them, has worn the channel, 6 or 7 miles up
 to its present situation – from a high point
 on the West Bank, had a view of the River
 down to the Lake, and by a small pocket
 Compass found that Fort Niagara bore from
 one N. by W. – In the afternoon Wm. Savery 
 and myself went on Horse Back to see
 the great Falls, on the way found the country thickly
 inhabited, all new settlements.- The River
 just above the Falls I suppose to be a mile
 wide, and the depth in some places 6 or 8 feet,
 this prodigious body of water, conjectured to be
 more than double the quantity that comes down
 the Falls of Delaware near Trenton, with
 amazing rapiddity shoots over the edge of a
 solid perpendicular Rock, and Falls (according to
 A. Elliotts account) 137 feet -

 - for about a mile above the great Fall, there is
 a continued succession of Cataracts, some of
 them 3 or 4 feet perpendicular, this greatly en-
creases the rapiddity of the current, until it comes
 to the edge of the Precipice, over which it dashes -





 The River at the Falls is divided by a small
 flat Island, of perhaps 250 yards in width, and twice
 that number in length - the sides and upper end,
 not much elevated above the surface of the River
 above the Falls, the lower end, which is on a line
 with the Falls, is a smooth perpendicular Rook, I suppose
 of about 150 feet high.- The edge of the Rock over
 which the water Falls, on the East side of the Island,
, is nearly a straight line,
 and the River, on that side, I suppose to be 250 yards
 wide, but the Water not so deep as on the West side
 where its width is the same - the
 edge of the Rook, on this side, forms near about
 half a Circle, the convex side upwards


 --The quantity of Water that passes on the West side,
 I suppose to be double that which passes on the
 East side of the Island, being in the middle 6 or 8
 feet deep above the Falls.- It is said that by
 actual survey there is found to be 50 feet fall in the
 one mile of Rapids just above the Falls, and
 from thence down to the Landing, 6 or 7 miles,
 the rappidity of the River renders it altogether
 impassable, in that distance the fall must be
 very considerable, so that taking the whole
 into view, we may conclude, that the surface
 of the Water of Lake Erie, is nearly 300 feet above
 that of Lake Ontario, the distance between these
 Lakes being only 36 miles. 2nd. This being the first day of the Week we
 attended a Meeting appointed by Friends, held in
 a Barn, about 2 miles from the Falls, at which
 were gathered a considerable number of sober
 well-behaved People, and ended much to satisfac-
tion - in the evening return'd to our Encamp-
ment, and were visited by Cornplanter the Seneca
 Chief.- This, and the preceeding day found plenty
 of ripe Strawberries. 3d. Hearing of a Vessell laying at Fort Erie,
 ready to Sail for Detroit we this morning got one of our
 Batteaux carried by Land to the mouth of
 Chippeway Creek two miles above the Falls,
 the distance 9 miles. [Cartage of Goods 2/N. York
 Carr'd. J Au.] 4th. Embark'd in our Batteaux and pushed up
 against a rapid Stream 18 miles to Fort Erie,
 where we embark'd on board a Kings Vessell,
 a schooner of about 100 Tons burthen, called
 the Dunmore, commanded by Captain Ford ,
 whose conduct towards us was civil and obliging.
- The Country from Chippeway Creek, on the
 West side, up to Fort Erie, is very thickly inhabited
 chiefly by new settlers from the united States.-
 We had on board the Dunmore 12 passengers
 in the Cabbin, several in the Steerage and
 upwards of 60 Indians, of different Tribes, on Deck,
 which with the Sailors, Marines etc., made the
 whole number on board, amount to upwards of
 90 Souls - the River from Chippeway to Fort
 Erie is from l ¼ to 2 miles wide, in which
 are several fine Islands - the Course nearly
 North and South. 5th. About 2 P.M.a fair wind springing
 up made Sail and got out into the Lake 6th, 7th and 8th. Variable Winds, and mostly
 >from the Southward with some Rain. 9th. At Noon passed the Bass Islands through
 the Northermost Channell, in which we found
 from 3 to 7 fathoms of Water.- The Bass Islands
 extend quite across the Lake about 40 miles
 below the mouth of Detroit River and make
 a very beautiful appearance, some of
 them are 6 or 7 miles in length, and
 we were informed are well cover'd with
 Timber and of an excellent soil - the
 smaller ones produce excellent Red
 Cedar Ship Timber - this being first Day
 had a Meeting in the Cabbin, with the Passengers
 and some of the Chiefs among the Indians, -
 which appear'd to give general satisfaction
 - about 11 P.M. came to an Anchor in De-
-troit River - distance from Fort Erie to Detroit 285 m--- 10th. On coming upon Deck this morning we
 were agree­ably surprised to find ourselves sailing
 up a fine River, with Plantations of new settlers
 on both sides - the father we advanced up, the
 beauty of the prospect increased, and when we
 came within 6 or 7 miles of the Town, a sight
 of the kind more pleasing, I think I never saw. The Country here was first settled
 by the French, it is said above one hundred years ago,
 whose decendants, in a general way, are still the
 Proprietors, and by whom that Language (with
 but few exceptions) is only spoken. - The front
 of each Lot on the River being but narrow, is
 almost wholly taken up with Buildings, Gardens
 and fine thrifty orchards, so that it has almost
 the appearance oft one continu­ ous Village quite up
 to the Town - we sometimes could count four
 or five Windmills in sight at once, and a
 pretty large Romish Chapple stands on the East
 side of the River, about 4 miles above the town.
- about 9 A.M. came to an Anchor before
 the Town of Detroit, - the distance from the
 mouth of the River 18 miles - course N b E
 - Detroit stands on the west side of the River, is
 a compact dirty little Town, containing about 100
 small Houses, entirely surrounded by a picquet
 Wall, having several Gates which are always shut at 9 oClo.
 - The Merchants of this place carry on a great
 Trade with the Indians, 8 or 10 Vessells being em-
ployed by them on the Lakes, who sail from Fort
 Erie in a Circuitous rout, sometimes to the dis-
tance of above 1000 miles to the Westward. 15th. Upon our arrival at Detroit, after
 some enquiry, took up our quarters at the
 house of Matthew Dolsen , who keeps a good
 table and an orderly House, - we lay upon our
 own Mattresses, and pay 4/ per day each, for
 our diet, exclusive of Liquor - Imported Goods
 are double the price they are in the
 United States, and Country produce nearly
 as high - a good calf is sold for £4.10 N.Y. Curr.,
 a Cow for £15.-, - Wheat 12/ per Bushel, -
 Salt 60/ per bushel. Soon after our arrival
 went out to visit Captain John a Chief
 of the Mohawks, and other Indians, who were
 our fellow passengers on board the Dunmore,
 we found them sober, and had some friendly
 conversation with them, endeavoring to
 inform them of our motives of leaving
 home, with which they seemed well pleas'd,
 and assured us of their hearty friendship
 - but the next day exhibited a very different
 scene - the War dance­ Captain John
 and most of his party were drunk - they
 were almost naked and frightfully painted
 which with their Yells, musick and Tomahocks
 afforded an entertainment, by no means
 pleasing - before they came to the door of
 our Lodging, Captain John, who did
 not join in the Dance, came forward, to assure
 us, that no injury was intended - We were obliged
 to give them a little Cyder and Tobacco. - It is a
 regulation in this Garrison that no Indian is
 allowed to remain within the Picquet all night,
- on the 13th Captain John, and his party, set
 off to attend the great Council of Indian
 Tribes, to be held, previous to the Treaty, at the
 Rapids of the Miami River. 14th. This morning breakfasted with Matthew Elliott ,
 Deputy superintendant of Indian Affairs, and on
 our return went to see a party of Chippeways,
 who had just came down from Michillamackanac,
 and were on their way to the great Council
 --we found them drunk--at first they shook
 hands with us, but soon grew furious, calling
 us in their way, long knife, and on our going
 away, two of them came after us, and with furi-
ous countenances, and violent gestures, insisted
 upon our returning, which we declined doing,
 and walk'd away - we were afterwards
 informed, by a person who accidentally happened
 to be present, and understood their Language,
 that they said they wanted us to go back that
 they might take our scalps - One of the two
 that followed us had his face painted black,
 his head decorated with black feathers, and
 a Scalp hanging at one Ear.-- this day we
 were invited to Dine with the officers of the
 24th Regiment, who treated us with great
 politeness, and hospitality, there was near
 15 officers at Dinner besides their guest. 15th. Captain Hendrick , and his party, went off towards
 the Miami - Captain Hendrick appears to be the most
 thoughtful and civilized Indian we have met
 with, and almost the only one that we have
 not seen drunk since we came to this place
 - we this day had a visit from some of the
 Wiandots, who reside not far from hence, they appear
 to have some knowledge of our society, and were
very friendly. 16th. This morning Captain Ford sailed for Fort Erie
 - by him I wrote to New York - at 10 A.M.our friends
 had a large satisfactory Meeting at Detroit, at
 which many Officers and Soldiers attended-
 in the afternoon at 4 oClock had another Meeting
 about 6 miles down on the east side of the
 River, at which were gathered a considerable
 number of well­behaved People - This day
 the Chippeways went on to the Council, at
 their departure, they sang the War Song,
 with great shouting etc. - in the evening
 arrived the Snow Chippeway from Fort Erie, in
 this Vessell a number of the Six Nation Indians
 came Passengers. 17th. Accounts are circulating here, and generally
 believed, that General Wayne has advanced his
 Army, a considerable distance from Fort Washing
-ton, toward the Indian Country - this, it is said,
 adds greatly to the jealousy and rage of the Indians
 - several Tribes, on the strength of these reports,
 we are inform'd, are return'd back to their
 Towns - the circulation of these reports, which
 is generally done by deserters from the American
 Army, will, in all probability, protract the time
 of holding of which the Treaty made , if not
 totally defeat this desirable event - some in
 this place have thrown out hints as if the
 Commissioners already were began to be apprehensive of
 personal danger, and meant not to advance any
 further. - John Parrish , Joseph Moore , and John Elliott 
 having some days ago dined with Col. England ,
 the Commandant, Jacob Lindley , W.Savery and
 myself, were this day, with much politeness,
 kindly entertained by the same Gentleman. 18th. Much pestered with visits from the Indians
 whose chief motives for these civilites, is to get
 a little Rum, but in this they are disappointed,
 we having come to a resolution to give them
 none, but put them off with a little Tobacco etc. 19th. Cross'd the River with J. Parrish , J. Lindley ,
 J. Moore and J. Elliott , (W.Savery being unwell)
 and went down about 6 miles on the East
 side - the good Land on the banks of the River
 on both sides does not extend above a mile
 back, beyond that it is low and marshy,
 little or none of it cultivated. - saw some beau
 beautiful pieces of wheat, fine orchards, full
 of fruit, Cherries ripe, and Cucumber vines
 just beginning to run.- The Land being rather
 low, their Indian corn is very short, about 8 or 9
 inches high in general. - We dined at Fredk.
 Arnolds, one of the society of the Dunkards, who
 a native of Germany, who formerly lived in
 Pensylvania, he inform'd me he purchased the
 place he now lives on, an old French settlement
 containing about 100 acres, with a tolerable good
 House, Barn and Orchard, for 300 N.Y. Currency.
 ­ He also let me see his Certificates, from
 Government, for Lands granted to him and his
 Children, by which I find they (the Certificates) are not, in
 any shape, transferable, either by sale, assign
 assignment, or Donation, and that the Titles
 are to be given upon such Conditions as may
 be the Kings pleasure. - At 5 P.M. had a
 solid satisfactory Meeting with a few of the
 Inhabitants, at the House of John Mesemer ,
 where we tarried all night. 20th. We proposed returning to Detroit this
 morning, but the wind coming a head, and
 blowing hard, prevented us - we went to
 Francis Cornwalls , a Connecticut Man, were
 we dined, and J.M. and myself, were kindly
 entertained at his house all night. 21st. Wind still at N.E. with much Rain
 and very cold for the season - the transitions
 from heat to cold, in this country, being very
 frequent, and I think to a much greater degree than
 in New Jersey - about 5 in the afternoon it began
 to clear away, but the wind still against us, Jacob
 Lindley and John Elliott left us and went on foot
 up to Detroit. 22d. A fine pleasant morning - after breakfast
 we embark'd in our Canoe, and with the assist-
ance of Fred Arnold , pushed up against the
 current to Detroit - A young Canadian we met
 with at F. Cornwall's inform'd us he had been
 several voyage's in the N.W. Trade, that they
 generally left Montreal in the begining of the
 5th month, and that, without any stop
 but making the best of their way, it took them so late
 in the fall, that the Rivers were often frose, before they
 got to their Journeys end. - the Indians they met with
 there were mostly a harmless honest People. Their
 Tents and dress being chiefly mostly made of Buffaloe Skins
 - he says the distance they went with their
 Canoe's taking the Course of the Lakes and Rivers
 was more than 2000 Leagues from Montreal. - this evening
 we were all invited to sup with the officers at
 the mess Room. 23d. Some Indians of the Chippeway Nation
 came in from the great Council at Miami
 who bring accounts, as we are told, that the
 Indians are very backward in gathering, few
 or none from the S.W. having yet come in,
 owing, it is said, to the injudicious movement
 of General Wayne . - Matthew Elliott gives it
 as his opinion, that the treaty will not com-
mence before the middle of next Month - at
 10 this morning had a Meeting in the Kings
 Sail Loft, in which some experienced their
 strength to be renew'd. 24th. Various are the reports that we daily hear,
 some of them exceedingly discouraging, insomuch
 that some of our Friends of this place, in the most serious
 manner, advise us not to think of attending
 the Treaty.- This day J. Hacken­ welder , with
 a number of his Brethren, the Moravian Indians,
 came to the Garrison from their settlement on
 the River La Trench, about 70 miles from hence,
 by them we understand that the said Indians
 Indians to the number of 140, were much
 distress'd for want of provisions, occasioned by
 their being frequently removed from place to
 place, since their first forcible removal
 from Muskingum - their approaching Crops, they
 say, are very promising, but their main
 dependance, in the meantime, is upon
 such vegetables as the Fields and Woods afford,
 , having but a very poor chance of
 hunting in their new settlement - Friends
 have it in contemplation to afford them
 a little assistance - the price of Indian Corn
 here, we are inform'd is 10/ per bushel. 25th. This morning went down to the wharf
 to see a Wolf that was kill'd last Night upon
 an Island about 3 miles from this place, it had
 by some means got there last Winter in the
 time of the Frost, and had done a great deal
 of damage, insomuch that the proprietor had
 offered a Reward of twenty Dollars for killing
 him. - he was much larger than a large
 Dog, of a grey or grisly colour. - his legs
 were as long as those of a large Deer, his Tail long
 and tapering, thinly covered with long hair, and
 his head in shape between that of a Dog and Fox. this evening morning arrived three large bark
 Canoes, with Twenty Eight Chippeways, from
 Michillamackanac, on their way to Miami. 26th. This morning sail'd the Snow Chippeway
 for Fort Erie, in whom went passenger Richd.
 Hillery, by whom I wrote to New York. Friends agreed with M.Dolsen to supply
 the Moravian Indians with Corn and Flour,
 to the value of one hundred Dollars, part of
 which was this morning delivered,
 for which they appear'd to be very grateful. Dined with John Askin Esqr., a Merchant
 of this place, by whom we were very agreeably
 entertained. - he, in some measure, corrobe-
rated the account given by the Canadian on
 the 22nd respecting the North West Trade - he
 says that from a place called the Grand Portage,
 at the upper end of the Lakes, they travel above
 2000 miles to the Westward, in small bark
 Canoes so light that two Men carry them - all the pro-
vision, allowed to each Man for this long
 voyage, being no more than one bushel of
 Indian Corn, that has been boil'd in Lye and hull'd
 and a little greese* (of what kind I know not)
 to mix with it.- this stock of corn is reserved
 for extraordinary occasions when they can
 neither get Fish or kill anything with their Guns.
- the Labouring People, in these long and tedious
 journeys, are all Canadians, who eat their
 Fish and Flesh without either bread or and Salt
 - at Dinner we had fresh Fish brought in
 a Sloop, six days from Lake Superior, they
 were the White Fish and Salmon trout, they
 would weigh about 6 lb. each, both exceeding good, but
 the White Fish, I think, rather preferable - in
 the afternoon arrived the Sloop Felicity from
 Grand River on Lake Erie, in her came a
 number of Indians Passengers - in conversation
 with M.Elliott , he gave it as his opinion, that
 four weeks would yet elapse before the commi
 Treaty began. 27th. had some conversation with Capt Drake ,
 an intelligent Man, who has for several years
 navigated a Vessell on the Lakes, by him was
 inform'd that from Detroit to the entrance of Lake ~~~~~~~~~~ *Hogs Lard and Tallow mixt together Lake St.Clair was about 6 miles, the length
 of said Lake 21 miles, from the N.W. end of
 Lake St. Clair to the entrance of Lake Huron,
 through a very beautiful River, 15 Leagues, from
 the lower end of Lake Huron to the rapids
 of St.Mary's (the entrance into Lake Superior),
 72 Leagues, at the rapids of St.Mary's there
 is a portage of a mile and a half, when goods
 are again shipped in large Vessells, who
 carry them 100 Leagues up Lake Superior to what is called
 the Grand Portage, from whence they go
 in small Canoes, to the North west.- He says
 that there are above One thousand Men
 constantly employed in the N.W. Trade
 above the Grand Portage. - He further says
 there are many mistakes in the drafts heretofore
 made of the Lakes, they not being done from
 actual surveys, but principally from
 the vague reports of Canadian traders &ca. - that
 the tales that have been told respecting Thund
 Thunder Bay in Lake Huron is altogether a
 farce, that in the course of many years, which
 he has now sail'd upon that Lake, he never
 was sensible of more thunder there, than at
 any other place on the Lake - that the
 length of Lake Superior ie much less than
 generally represented, and that from two
 opposite points, about the middle of said
 Lake, the width does not exceed 70 miles. 28th. Very warm and sultry with Thunder
 and rain. - about 10 at Night
 five or six Guns were fired just without the
 Pickets, which, at first, as we lay in Bed,
 alarmed us not a little, but we were desired
 to make ourselves easy, as, in all probability,
 it was nothing more than some people who
 had been watching for Wolves, or shooting
at Indians who were robbing Cherry Trees 29th. Visited by a Chief of the Wiandot Indians
 who was sober and intelligent, he spoke
 respectfully of our Society, and said that
 many Belts of Wampum, and other mem
 memorials of ancient Friendship received
 from them, were still carefully preserved
 by their Nation. - expressed the satisfaction he
 felt in seeing so many of the people call'd
 Quakers, and said, as the Great Spirit had
 been with them, brought them so far -
 through the Wilderness, and preserved them
 all in good health, so he hoped, he would still
 continue to be their rotector through every
 danger, and carry them safe home. being in Company with Nathan
 Williams, a sensible Man who had
 formerly been a Trader, and well acquain
 acquainted with the Indians - he express'd
 his apprehensions on our account,
 and openly gave it as his opinion, that
 if we attended the Treaty, we should either
 be kill'd, or detained as Prisoners. were informed that the Guns we heard 
 last Night, were fired at Wolves, by People who
 were watching for them, near the Carcases
 of several dead Sheep which were kill'd
 by them the Night before 30th. First day - early this morning had a
 Visit from the Blind Chief, a head Man among
 among the Wiandots, with several of
 his attendants, they were sober, and what
 is remarkable, neither these Men, nor
 those that visited us yesterday, made any
 request for Rum. - at 10 A.M. had a
 Meeting in the Sail Loft, and another at
 the same place at 5 in the Afternoon, at
 both of which were a pretty large number
 of Soldiers, and Towns people, and a few
 of the officers of the Garrison, their conduct
 generally was very commendable, and
 the Meetings, in the main, solid and
 satisfactory.- In the evening there
 was a Marriage at our Lodgings, - the
 Young Man is a settler upon the River
 La Trench, and a Nephew to our Landlord
 M.Dolsen , the Young Woman is a Native
 of Virginia who was taken a Prisoner by
 the Indians, from whom she made her
 escape. - the Ceremony was perform'd by
 J. Arken Esq , and the whole decently condu
 conducted. 7 mo. 1st. was an Eye witness of a Funeral in
 the Popish Style 








 -- This afternoon
 arrived the Snow Ottaway from Fort Erie, by
 this Vessell, we learn, that the day before she
 sail'd, an Express came to the Commissioners
 from Philadelphia, and another from Fort
 Pitt, - various are the reports here, some
 favourable, others exceedingly discouraging,
 but having no accounts from the Commissioner
 we re anxiously waiting the next arrival
 for further intelligence. - The Ottaway
 brought a great number of Indians from
 Fort Erie, all of whom were whom were Landed at the
 Mouth of the Miami, except 17 of the Oneida
 Nation, whom Colt Butler would not
 permit to be left landed there, alleging they
 were in danger of being killed by the other
 Indians.- We had a Letter from a person,
 who happened accidentally to be in company
 with Colonel Butler , he inform'd us that
 he heard him say, that, if the demands of the
 Indians were not complyed with, it was
 his opinion, that the Commissioners, and the
 whole of their Retinue, would be massacre'd
 - we also had a Letter from Col.McKee , the
 British Agent, in answer to one wrote him.
- he dates his Letter from the Foot of the Rapids
 of the Miami River, and promises to give us
 the earliest intelligence of the time when the
 Treaty will likely commence The following Account is taken from

 being very sultry, Our Landlord invited the
 whole of our Company, viz. Six Friends,
 Wm.Wilson , (Merchant from Fort Pitt & Indian
 interpretter,) Doctor McCoskry , & J. Heckenvelder ,
 to spend the Day at his Farm about five
 miles below on the opposite side of the
 River.- We set off about 9 oClock, taking
 with us provision &ca., and spent an
 agreeable day under a pleasant Shade on
 the Banks of the River, - returning home
 in the afternoon we cross'd the River, and
 some of us landed at the Spring Well & walk'd
 home, the distance being three miles, and the
 Road very pleasant. 3d. Perplex'd with various reports, and
 contradictory opinions.- it is said, the
 American A:rmy ie still advancing, and
 that an encampment is form 'd, in front of
 Fort Jefferson, within 30 miles of where the
 last Battle was fought.- that the Indians
 are more & more settled in their 
 determination, that nothing short of the
 boundary line being fixt on the River Ohio,
 will ever induce them to lay down the
 Hatchet, - that, in consequence of this
 resolution, they have sent a deputation
 to the Commissioners at Niagara, in order,
 if their instructions does not impower
 them to make such a Cession, to prevent
 their taking the unnecessary trouble of
 coming forward any further.- indeed,
 it seems to be the prevailing opinion of
 the day, that there will be no Treaty at
 all. - A number of Philadelphia and
 New York News Papers came to Colt England 
 by the Ottaway, some as late as the 23d of
 last Month, since we have been favour'd
 with the perusal of most of them - we
 were sorry to find some irritating and
 inflamatory pieces, particularly one, which
 censures the Government of the United States,
 for attempting to Treat with the Indians,
 under British influence, ungenerously
 branding the whole of that Nation with
 the opprobious epithet of Cut Throats. - all
 the officers, that we have as yet heard speak
 upon the subject, make light of it, and
 say, it is but little more than what, at
 times, appear in their own prints -
 whither it is really their contempt of
 such scandalous pieces, or their politeness,
 which will not permit them to give us
 uneasiness, that makes them appear
 so indifferent, is what I will not determine. 4th. Extremely Warm & sultry, light airs of
 Wind from the South West. - Captn. Monsey 
 inform 'd us that the Thermometer belonging
 to the Officers was, in the Shade, up to 100,
 in the Sun it rose to 117 degrees. from the best information I can gather it
 appears that a great proportion of the Country
 around the Lakes is low and Marshy, so as to
 be wholly incapable of cultivation, and in
 many places, of great extent, almost
 intirely cover 'd with Water, in which grow 
the Timber and long Grass, affording shelter
 for wild Beasts, and Vermin, in abundance. 5th. Had an interview with a Young Shaw-
-nese Warrior, who is lately from the Council
 at the Rapids - his Brother is a head Man
 amongst them, and he being often with
 them in Council, is acquainted with the result
 of their deliberations, so far as they have come
 to a conclusion among themselves - he inform'd
 us, there are about 1200 collected at the Rapids,
 mostly the Northern Indians, and 700 of
 the Southern Indians, are embodied at
 another place, a considerable distance,
 up the same River, watching the motions of General Waynes 
 Army.­ he confirms the account of a
 Deputation being sent to the Commissioners,
 and that the object of their Mission was, in
 substance, the same as has already been
 noted - that they have most decidedly come
 to a resolution, to accept of no terms short of
 making the Ohio the boundary line. - Our
 Interpretter was formerly a Prisoner among the
 Shawnese, and had been adopted into the family
 of this Young Man, in the place of his Father,
 and in their discourse the Indian gave him
 that appellation, saying, my Father, I will
 tell you what I know, and speak the truth - in
 the begining of the World, this Land was given
 to the Indians, and the White People were placed
 beyond the great water - when the white Men
 first came to this Land, the wise old Men
 among the Indians, told their People, that if
 they received anything of the white Men, they
 would be destroyed,­ "the bitter Water was made
 for white folks, but the Water of the Brooks and
 Rivers for, the Indians, - but not regarding
 this advice, many of the Nations Traded with
 the Whites, took their Hatchets, Knives and
 Rum, and gave up their Land for trifles,
 and, according to the ancient prediction, they
 have wasted away, and some of them -
 become quite extinct, and the few that
 are remaining are driven, almost to
 to where the sun sets, but they are now
 determined to be driven no further, should
 they go to where the Sun sets, they would
 all be lost forever. - The Congress must
 remove their Forts, and all their People over
 the River, and then the Indians will take
 them by the hand, and become their true
 friends - but should the Commissioners
 meet the Indians in Council, and there
 pretend that they have conquered their
 Country, and will not remove out of it, in
 that case, the Indians will withdraw from
 the Council, and then, instantly, fall upon
 the opposite party, and destroy them all -
 this is the substance of what he said as
 intrepretted by Sylvester Ash Sylv Ash, as near as I can re-
member. -- This day the Ottaway sail'd
 for Fort Erie, in whom M.Elliott embark'd,
 to be landed at the Mouth of. the Miami River
 - Thermometer, in the Shade 102, in the
 Sun 123 - In the evening after having
 made the above remarks, the Shawen-
ese Warriour abovementioned return'd to our
 our Lodgings, being in Liquor, he desired
 to enquire of the Landlord whither
 he could tarry in hie House all Night, but
 being told that it was contrary to the regulations
 of the Garrison, he seemed to be displeased, and
 ask'd for his Tomahawk, which Ash had in
 keeping, and going up stairs to get it, the
 Indian followed him, and on receiving it,
 said he was Drunk, and did not know what
 might happen before Night - then lifting
 his Tomahawk, attempted to strike Ash ,
 who being upon his guard, seized his arm
 and pushed him down Stairs - he then
 went up to M. Dolsen , knock'd off his Hat,
 and in the Indian tongue, bid him be
 Strong, and see if he could turn him
 out, and made a stroke, in which the
 Hatchet flew off the halve. - Dolsen im-
-mediately seized him, turned him out of
 the House, and bruized him pretty much,
 the Indian seeing his blood run, and
 having recovered his Tomahawk, flourished
 it about in a great rage, and in all
 probability, had not Capt. Munsey , an
 officer of the Garrison, been present, some
 mischief would have been done, but
 the captain took away his Tomahawk,
 and sent for a Guard, who turn'd him out
 of the Fort. 6th. Arrived the Sloop Felicity from the
 Miami River - people here are more
 and more confirmed in the belief that it
 will not be safe for us to attend meet the
 Indians at Sandusky. - this day also
 arrived the Schooner Nancy from 
 Michillamackanac 7th. being first day had a satisfactory
 Meeting, at the usual place and time,
 in the Morning, and also Friends had
 another at 4 in the afternoon, five or
 six miles from hence, at the River Rouge,
 at which, not being very well, I was
 not present. - Captain John a Chief
 of the Mohawks arrived from the Council
 at the Miami River, and also two or three
 Indians of the Stockbridge Nation, with
 a Letter from Captain Hendrick s, their Chief
 - they confirm the accounts, already receiv'd
 received, of a deputation being set down
 to the Commissioners 8th. Had a visit from David Kennedy , a
 half Indian, of the Mohawk Nation, who had
 been Educated in Scotland, sensible well-informed
 Man, but too much adicted to the vice so
 prevalent among the Indians, the Love of
 Rum, - he came in company with Capt.
 John from the Council - says he was
 not admited into the secret Council of the
 Indians, but from what he could gather, was
 not without a hope that peace may be
 established. - The Stockbridge Indians return'd
 return'd to their Chief at the Miami, with
 a small supply of necessaries, afforded
 them by Friends. 9th. Captain Blue Jacket , the famous Chief
 of the Shawnese, who commanded at the
 defeat of General St. Clair , paid us a Visit
 this morning, - he is a stout well-looking
 Man of about 45 years of age, Dress'd in
 in a Shirt, scarlet Coat, with gold apaulets
 and a Gold laced Hat, Leggins and Mockasins,
 but, as all other Indians are, without Breeches.
 -He was very cautious of speaking upon
 public affairs, said he was not the Head-
Man of his Nation, but only a War-chief,
 as such he had given his opinions with
them sentiments to the Council, and now
 left it with them; whose business it was, to
 determine as they might think proper
 - said he had heard we were in Detroit,
 and having some business this way, came
 to see us, but had nothing to say on Public
 matters - he had often heard of Quakers, he
 said, but had never seen any of them be-
fore, and, expressing his regard for them,
 and satisfaction with the Visit, took his
 leave. - Friends had a desire to be more
 particular with him, in regard to the Objects
 which induced them to take this long Jour-
ney, but the Interpretter not seeming to
 be disposed to gratify them in that respect,
 they were constrained, after expressing a little
 of their desires for the Peace and wellfare of man kin
 mankind, to be silent. - Blue Jacket 
 said that should the Commissioners & Indians
 meet at a Treaty, and matters like to be ac-
-commodated, it was his opinion it would
 be two Months before the business would be
 compleated. - this day sail'd the Schooner
 Nancy for Fort Erie, a Merchant Vessell, with
 a Cargo of Peltry, and Indian-made Maple-
 Sugar, by this it may appear, that a greater
 quantity of Sugar is procured from the Indians
 than is consumed in this part of the Country,
how much lower down, the Country is
 is not supplied in the same way,
 is what I cannot determine, but from the
 best information, I am ready to think, that
 very little foreign Sugar, if any, if any foreign sugar (except refined)
 is consumed in Upper Canada. 10th. Arrived the Sloop Detroit from Fort
 Erie, we hear by this Vessell that the-
Commissioners had taken their passage
 in the Dunmore, and may be hourly
 expected.- The Chippeways in which the
 the Indian Deputies embark'd, had not
 arrived at Fort Erie when the Detroit Sail'd.
 - We are told the Commissioners are not
 to come to this Garrison, but to Land, and
 encamp, at the mouth of the River, there
 to wait the proper time to proceed to Sandusky
 - in the Detroit came up the Cordage for a
 new Vessell, now building on Lake Superior 11th. Dined at James Abbotts , a Merchant of this
 place, we were kindly entertained, and spent
 an agreeable afternoon. 12th. Spent the Day at M.Dolsen 's place on
 the East side of the River.- In the afternoon
 sail'd the Sloop Detroit for the Falls of St.Mary's,
 and about the time arrived the
 Sloop Saganough from Fort Erie, by this
 Vessell we were informed that the Commissioners
 were all on on board the Dunmore, ready
 to sail, and only waiting for a Wind, when
 the Chippeway arrived with the Indian
 deputies, on which a Council was held, the
 result was, that, at the request of the Indians,
 the Commissioners were to return to Navy
 Hall, in order that Governor Simcoe might
 be present at the conference. 13th. was invited by Wm. Baker , late of New
 York, shipwright, to take a sail up the
 River as far as Lake Sinclair - set off about
 9 oClock and had a pleasant run up
 to the upper end of Hog Island, from whence
 we had a view of Lake Sinclair, and
 return'd home in the evening - for
 about the distance of 10 miles, nothing
 of the kind, that ever I saw, exceeds the
 banks of this River for the beauty of its
 prospects, - The Lots are all regularly laid
 out, being in front three square Acres
 only in breadth, on which are the build-
-ings, Gardens and Orchards.- In the
 afternoon of this day arrived the Sloop
 Speedwell from Fort Erie, who furnished
 us with intelligence from various-
 quarters.- we had several Letters from
 Philadelphia address'd to our Company
 jointly, and most of our friends had
 particular accounts from their dear
 connections at Home. - we had also
 a joint letter from Col Pickering , in
 behalf of the Commissioners, with a large
 bundle of Philadelphia Newspapers as
 late as the 6th ultimo. -- Col. Pickering 
 informs us they were all on board, and
 ready to Sail, when the Indian Deputies
 arrived, who informed the Commissioners,
 their business was to have a conference
 with them in the presence of Governor
 Simcoe, this he says will unavoidably
 occasion a delay of some days, if not
 supersede the intended Treaty.- we
 are now anxiously waiting the arrival
 of the Dunmore, who in all probability,
 will either bring forward the Commissioners,
 or information that all hopes of a
 Treaty are vanished. 14th - Being first day had a Meeting in the
 Sail Loft, which was large and on
 on the whole satisfactory 15th. The Weather for these several Days past
 has been cool and pleasant, the wind N.W.
 with a clear and serene sky­ Wheat Harvest
 is now begun in this neighbourhood 16th. Friends being a little uneasy with being
 so long in a state detained in a state of
 idleness, waited upon Matthew Elliott , to
 know his sentiments, in respect to our
 visiting the Indians assembled at the Miami
 - he gave it as his opinion, that, as they
 were now holding a Council on their own
 affairs, it would not be prudent, without an
 invitation from them, to take such a step;
but if Friends but, as he expected to go there
 himself in a Day or two, if Friends had
 an inclination to send them a Message,
 he would punctually deliver it. - This
 being taken into consideration, and there
 being a probability that we may not
 have another opportunity of communicating
 our sentiments, and the motives which
 which induced us to come forward,
 we gladly accepted the offer 17th. Captain Elliott intending this day
 for the Indian Council, the following ad-
dress was agreed to, and enclosed in a
 Letter to Colonel McKee , who is desired
 to communicate the same to the Indians To the Indians, assembled at the Rapids
 of the Miami Brothers,
We who send you this Letter
 are of the People called Quakers, and have
 left our homes and families in Pensylvania
 and New Jersey, and taken this long Journey
 to see you purely from motives of Love and
 good will, and to endeavour to promote
 peace.- We have been now five weeks at
 Detroit waiting for the opening of the Treaty
 at Sandusky, where we expected to have seen
 you all, but as we have heard a number
 of your People are gone to Niagara to meet
 the Commissioners, we do not know but the
 business may be so concluded there, as that
 they may come no farther. Brothers, We have brought with us an
 address to you from our Brethren at home
 which we are very desirous of presenting to
 you with our own hands, if an opportunity
 can be had. - it is also in our hearts to
 acquaint you that we consider all Men
 as the Children of one common Father, and
 think it our duty to Love all as Brothers.
 -We believe it displeases the Great and Good
 Spirit when Men injure and kill one
 another, therefore we endeavour to do Justice,
 but when any dispute arises, we leave it
 to be settled by disinterested and impartial
 persons, and never go to war on any-
 occasion.- We have been made very
 sorrowful on account of the War and bloodshed
 between the United States and our Indian
 Brethren, and want much to see you
 that we may open our Hearts more
 fully than we can do by writing, for we
 are fully convinced that by looking up
 to the Great Spirit for Counsel, all differences
 may be settled without fighting and killing
 one another, which we think is very
 Cruel and attended with many distressing
 circumstances both to you and the White People. Our society have experienced for more
 than one hundred years great advantage
 and satisfaction in living Peaceably with
 all Men, and are very desirous that you
 may enjoy the same benefits, and to that
 end were made willing to expose ourselves,
 encounter hardships, and spend our sub-
stance to promote Peace and Love between
 you and the Government of the United
 States.- We pray the Good Spirit
 that He may put an end to the ravages
 of War and unite all Men as Brethren,
 that by being bound together in one great
 Chain of Love and friendship which can
 cannot be broken, we may all seek the
 happiness of each other in this Life, and
 be prepared prepared for the enjoyment of
 of everlasting happiness in the Life
 which is to come. Detroit 7 mo 17th, 1793J.P.

 W.H. 18th. Some of our Friends had an interview
 with a Person of the Name of Wilbank, who-
 within a few days past arrived, with a Party
 of 26 Southern Indians, from the back parts of
 the Carolina's and Georgia, at the Great Council
 at the Miami, - he came from thence to this
 place, and a Vessel is to be dispatched immediately
 to carry him down to Governor Simcoe . He says,
 that the Indians have in several instances
 been grossly imposed upon, particularly by
 Governor Blount , who by bribing an Interpreter
 had cheated them out of a great extent of
 Country, and defrauded them of one half
 the Sum, agreed upon to be paid yearly, as
 as a compensation for the Land granted,-
 in one instance where they had agreed to
 sell 50 miles square they had fraudulently
 put in the Deed 80 miles - and where they had
 had bargained for an extent of 10 miles
 round the Town of Nashville, Governor Blount 
 had caused 40 miles to be inserted.- and instead
 of a Consideration of 2000 Dollars yearly, he had
 put down but 1000 dollars.- This being but
 one side of the question, we do not pretend to
 Judge, but it is the received opinion here, that
 their errand to the Council is, to form a Union
 with the Northern Indians, and make One
 common cause, either in forming a Treaty,
 or carrying on a War. - The Vessell (the Felicity) to Carry
 Wilbank to Fort Erie, sail'd about 2 oClock:-
 - Yesterday a young Man going out to look
 for Horses, got lost in the Woods, which are very
 thick within less than a Mile of the Fort.-
 several 18 pounders were fired in the afternoon
 in order to direct him in finding the way back,
 which, I suppose had the desired effect, as I am
 informed he got safe home in the Evening -
- several instances of the kind have before
 occurred, and sometimes the persons lost have
 never returned. - It is said some little time
 past, two Indians were kill'd by the Wolves
 in the Neighbourhood of this place. 19th. Having received many civilities from
 the officers of the 24th British Regiment, now at
 this place, gratitude induces me to wish to
 remember their names, which from a printed
 account published in the year 1792, I find to be
 as follows.- Lt.Col- Lieutenants Ensigns Richd. England 2D W.C.Short.D Wm. Kelly D Willm. Campbell Wlm. Robison D. C.Vandeleur D Major~~ Geo. Meyrick F.J., O'Brien D Captains R. Christmas J.C.

Leybourne D Jam. Magarth -- Crawford-D Paul Mounsey D Richd. Foster Ferg. Speers , Joseph Blunt Chs. Earle Ct. Lt. 20th. The Wind which for many days past
 has been from the S.W.and consequently
 unfavourable for coming up the Lake, yesterday
 and today has blown from the N.E., so that
 we are now hourly in hopes of having
 intelligence from below, which we expect
 will cause our immediate removal from
 this place 21st. Being First Day, a Meeting was
 held at 10 oClock in the Sail Loft and
 another at the same place at 5 in the
 afternoon, both satisfactory. About Noon arrived Lieut. Givens Gibbons of
 the Queens Rangers, who brought the agree
able intelligence that the Dunmore, with
 the Commissioners on Board had arrived at
 the mouth of the River. - About 5 oClock,
 (having Landed the Commissioners) the
 Dunmore came up to the wharf, - in
 the evening had a Visit from Lt. Givens Gibbons,
 by him we are informed that the Com-
missioners are come forward with a
 full expectation of a Treaty, very speedily,
 being held. - He says the Deputation from
 the Indians, who had a conference with
 the Commissioners in the presence of Govnr.
 Simcoe, to all appearance, return'd well
 satisfied, and that in his opinion there
 is a great probability of an accomodation matters being
 accomodated. - That the main business
 of the Indian Deputies was to enquire, in
 in the first place, whither the Com-
-missioners were properly authorized to
 treat, and secondly, whither they had
 power to recede from the boundary-
Line now claimed by the United States,
 and being satisfied in both these points,
 they took the Commissioners by the hand, and
 presenting them with a Belt of white Wamp
-um, invited them to come forward to the
 Treaty. - We are informed by Captain
 Ford that he has orders to attend upon the
 Commissioners with his Vessell, and expects
 to be ready to proceed to the Mouth of
 the River in a Day or two. 22d. We were busy in settling our little
 concerns, and preparing to leave Detroit,
 ware where we have experienced many marks
 of polite attention, and hospitallity, especially
 from the officers of the Garrison, beyond what
 some of us expected or even flatter'd ourselves
 was our due. - Our way hitherto, in every
 every sense, has been made pleasant
 beyond what could have been foreseen,
 or reasonably expected, - for this great
 favour, thanksgiving and praises are
 due to the Great Author of every good --The kind attention which, unrecom-
mended, we have received from Strangers, I
 hope, will ever be kept in grateful re-
membrance, and I cannot but conclude,
 the obligation is greatly enhanced by the
 persuasion, that it proceeded not from
 sinester motives, but was simply
 the effusion of noble and generous Minds. 23d. This morning Col. England called
 at our Quarters, and kindly offered to
 lend us his Barge to go down to go down
 the River, or accommodate us in any
 other way that might be more agreeable,
 but, as the Dunmore would be ready to Sail
 on the morning of the 25th, he would re-
commend it to us to wait untill that
 time and go down in her - we
 acknowledged his kindness, and concluded
 to go in the Dunmore -- We were this
 Day visited by a young Shawnese Warriour,
 a relation of Col.McKee , the Brish Agent,
 - His Shirt was red stript Persian, orna-
mented with One thousand Six hundred small
 round silver Broaches.- He was accompanied
 by another Beau, the rim of whose Ears were
 cut all round, except about an inch of the
upper end part - the part thus cut was so
 streatch'd, and wound about with coarse
 brass wire, that it form'd an Oval of about
 three inches in length and two in breadth,
 at the lower end of which each hung an
 a Silver Cross, of above four three inches long. 24th. Got most of our Baggage, Stores etc. on
 board the Dunmore, Captain Ford informing
 us he intended to sail early in the
 Morning. 25th. About 9 oClock embark'd on board
 the Dunmore for the mouth of Detroit River
 River. - Col England having a desire
 to see the Commissioners took a passage
 with us, together with Lieut. Henn , and
 Ensign O 'Brien . - We had a pleasant
 Sail down the River, and in our way
 spoke the Schooner Nancy from Fort Erie.
 -at 2 oClock P.M. anchor'd opposite the
 House of M. Elliott , where the Commissioners
 have taken up their quarters-
 We met
 with a kind reception, and were truly
 glad to find our very respectable fellow
 Travellers in good health and spirits. -- - Captain Bunbury of the 5th. Regimt.
 and Lieutn. Givens of the Queens Rangers
 are appointed by Govn. Simcoe to bear
 the Commissioners company to the
 Treaty. - in the evening we
 pitch'd our Tents on a very pleasant
 Green on the River side, near the
 House where the Commissnrs. reside. - Our
 little encampment now consists of
 Twelve Tents. 26th. a very sultry day, - walk'd
 about a Mile & a half down the River
 Lake to Simon Girty 's, who is an
 Indian interpretter in the Brittish
 Service, and now attending the
 Council at the Miami River - in
 the evening it became Cloudy with
 distant Thunder, and before morning
 we had a very heavy Rain with much
 Thunder and Lightning - some of the
 company were obliged to quit their Tents
 and take shelter in the House. 27th. This morning an opportunity
 presenting, William Savery and Jos.
 Moore went up to Detroit in Company
 with Gotlob Sansemen , a Preacher among
 the Moravian Indians who reside on the
 River La Trench. 28th. John Parrish , Jacob Lindley , and
 John Elliott and myself, went over to
 to Gros Isle where we had a Meeting
 at the House of Wm. McComb Esqr. , who
 for the most part resides at Detroit, where
 his family is at present. - a considerable
 number of the Inhabitants were present
 - Gros Isle is situated at the Mouth of
 Detroit River, is seven miles long and
 two wide - The soil and Timber remarkably
 good, the whole being the property of Wm.
 McComb. - several of our acquaintance
 came from Detroit to pay us a Visit, among
 whom John Asquith and Francs. Cornwall 
 - in the evening a number of the
 Oneida Indians, the same who arrived
 the first of this Month, were encouraged
 by some of the young Men of our Company
 to have a Dance, - they began about
 8 oClock and continued untill 2 in the
 Morning, during which time, their
 Music and Shouts, effectually prevented
 us from Sleeping. 29th. Willm. Savery return'd from Detroit
 in Company with Capt. Freeman and Ensign
 Broadhead , Joseph Moore intending to
 come down with the Schooner Nancy
 who it is expected will leave Detroit tomorrow
 on her way to Fort Erie.- In the evening
 arrived two large Batteaux, with Captain
 Elliott, Tho. McKee (son of the Col. ) and
 a number of Indians who are said to be a
 deputation from the great Council - Elliott 
 McKee and some others came over to
 us, but the Indians landed on an Island
 opposite to our Encampment. - We are
 informed the Indians at the Council are
 much dissatisfied with the conduct of their
 Chiefs who met the Commissioners at Navy Hall
 - that they either mistook their instructions,
 or neglected to follow them, in consequence
 of which, this second Deputation is sent. - Their first and Principal business we
 are told is to know of the Commissioners whither
 whither they have power to make the
 Ohio the boundary line, if not, the whole
 business is at an end. 30th. About 9 A.M. the Indian Deputies,
 twenty five in number, came over and
 had a public conference with the Commissionrs -Their speaker (whose name in English is Carry-folks People-
 about) express'd their gladness that it had pleas'd
 the Great Spirit to bring the Commissioners thus
 far in safety and good health, and then
 proceeding to business, said, there had some
 mistake happened at the Conference at Navy
 Hall, and in order to rectify which they
 had now come forward wih a message
 from the Council, and, that they might not
 be liable to blunder a second time, they had
 brought a Paper, which spoke what was in their their whole
 Heart. - They then delivered the Letter, being
 in substance the same as we were told last
 night, - After a few minutes private consul-
tation, Genl. Lincoln , in behalf of the Commiss.
 told them the Indians, that the Contents of the
 Paper should be considered, and an Answer
 given Tomorrow. - We were inform'd,
 that, as Capt.Elliott , when he parted with
 the Commissioners, on going to the Miami,
 fully expected their would be a Treaty, had
 concluded to leave the Letter to Col. McKee 
 (inclosing our Address to the Indians) of the
 17th, with the Comissnrs. to be return'd to us,
 which has been done accordingly.- about
 4 P.M. Joseph Moore landed from the
 Schooner Nancy, having left Detroit about
 10 in the morning,- the Nancy proceeded on
 her way to Fort Erie. 31st. The Indians came over about 10 oClock, but
 were informed that an answer would not be ready
 for them before 5 in the afternoon,- about
 that time the Deputies assembled, and Col.
 Pickering, in behalf of the Commissioners, ap
 -pologized for making them wait so long for
 an answer.- He then according to the
 Indian custom, repeated over the Contents of
 the written message brought from the Council
 at the Miami, and proceed to read a very
 lengthy answer, which in the first place
 pointed out the improbability of any part of
 the business being misunderstood at the conference
 at Niagara, and stated such facts as made
 it appear that such a pretence could be
 nothing less than want of sincerity.- men
 -mention was then made of the several
 Treaties concluded since the establishment
 of the Independance of the United States, and
 of the new settlements made in consequence
 of those treaties, and of the impossibility of
 removing such a great number of Families
 from their habitations and Farms; and
 therefore, in the most explicit terms de-
clared declared that the United States could
 not agree that the River Ohio should be
 the boundary line.- In the next place
 the Commissioners acknowledged that very
 improper Language had been held out at
 former Treaties, when it had been said that
 the United States claimed all the Indian Coun
-try, (within certain limits mark'd out by
 the Treaty of Peace with the British) as a con-
quer'd Country.- The Commissioners
 therefore, in the clearest terms, now relin-
-quishd all such claim, reserving only the
 preemption, or exclusive right of purchasing
 of the Indians.- The Commissioners then
 express'd their desires to meet the Indians in
 full Council, and a belief that if such 
work a thing could be done, and a friendly
 conference take place, a satisfactory and lasting
 Peace would be the consequence - They
 concluded with intimating that for the
 sake of an accommodation they would be
 willing to give up all the Land to the N.W. of the
 Ohio, excepting such only as were absolutely~
 appropriated, and, for such as were appropri-
-ated, a generous compensation should be
 paid down, and a yearly Rent allowed
 forever.- The answer was interpretted
 paragraphically as it was read, and then
 the whole writing given to the Indians. -The old Wiandot Chief who delivered the
 message yesterday, got up and said, as the
sun was going down they would consider of what was said by
 the Commissioners answer and speak a few
 words to them in the Morning. 8 mo. 1 - The Indians came over about
 7 oClock in the morning, and having met the
 Commissioners in Council - the old Chief
 who spoke last night arose, and said, they
 perfectly understood all that was said to them
 yesterday, and had only to say, that in
 regard to the several Treaties mentioned
 yesterday, they did not acknowledge any of
 them to be valid, and as the Commissioners
 had said they could not remove the white
 People over the River, so they, the Indians,
 could not consent to give up any of their
 Country, and concluded with saying,
 they came as Men wishing for Peace,
 but as that could not be obtained, they
 should return to their Council, and speak
 to their warriors:- And as for the Commissioners.
 they the Indians had nothing more to say to
 them, they might go home, and tell the
President Washington what the Indians had said.- -After the Indians had retired a few minutes,
 Simon Girty their interpretter, and several of
 their Chiefs, came back, and said, there had
 been a mistake in the last part of the -
 speech - that the business of the Deputies
 was to carry the Commissioners answer to the
 Great Council, and they desired the Comissnrs.
 would wait a few days for a final answer. -The Indians then immediately took their
 leave, and Thos. McKee , about 11 oClock also
 set off for the Miami, and as the prospect of meeting
 the Indians at a general Treaty now
 appears very faint, Friends concluded to forward
 the address to the Indians, agreed upon the 17th ulto. ultimus
 by him, under cover to his Father Col. McKee . 2nd. Being a pleasant day walk'd about four
 miles down the Lake - the place where we are
 encamp'd is the property of Capt. Matthew Elliott ,
 on which is a handsome convenient House,
 and a very large new Barn - the Land appears
 to be of an excellent quallity both for Grass and
 every kind of Grain.- He has a large stock of
 fine Cattle, among which are 12 yoke of Oxen,
 and I counted 31 Calves and 43 milch Cows
 - they are just now geting in the last of
 their Harvest, the wheat and oats have suffer'd
 much from prodigious flocks of Black Birds,
 notwithstanding the vigilence of several
 who were continually upon the watch to keep
 them off - The Indian Corn is begining to
 be fit for Roasting, and it is the business of
 one hand to watch the Birds, who have
 already done great damage in the field. --The Black Birds, we are told, are equally
 mischievious in all parts of the Country. --Came down, and sail'd the Sloop anchor'd
 opposite our Encampment, the Sloop Detroit
 from Michilimackanac bound to Fort Erie. 3d. This morning intended going in a Canoe
 about 4 miles up the River to a Wiandot
 Village, but the wind blowing hard from
 the S.W. prevented us. 4th. Heavy rain last night, and all this
 morning untill Hoon - in the afternoon
 had a Meeting at the House of Simon Girty 
 about 5 oClock.- about 11 A.M. the Chipeway
 pass'd by on her way from Fort Erie and Miami
 River, bound to Detroit - She sent on Shore
 a Packet for the Commissioners from Philadelpa
 among its contents were News Papers as
 late at the 25th of the 6th month. 5th. The Wind moderated, and Weather
 clear'd away, - sail'd the Sloop Detroit for
 Fort Erie. 6th. About 2 oClock P.M. departed this Life a
 poor Indian Slave who belonged to M. Elliott . --There is a Nation far to the westward,-
 called Panies, or Pawnees, with whom, it is said,
 the Chippeway's are at perpetual war, - it
 was a Custom formerly among these barbarous
 Nations to put all their prisoners to Death,
 but since their acquaintance with the
 White People these prisoners are become an
 article of Traffic, and sold to the Traders, --
 who again dispose of them to the Settlers,
 by this means Indian Slaves are become
 numerous, and all, however acquired, go
 under the denomination of Pawnees. -- -The poor fellow above mentioned was a Pawnee
 and had for a long time been in a declining way,
 but was so well this morning as to be able to walk
 about the Door - he died at 2 in the afternoon and
 was put in the Grave about 7 the same evening -
 -The burial was attended by most of the Commissioners
 retinue, and J.M. spoke a few words at the Grave
 well adapted to the occasion. 7th. This day the Commissioners were furnished
 with a few ripe Water Melons, being the first I
 have seen. 8th. The wind blew hard from the Eastward
 the greatest part of the last night, attended
 with Rain- this Wind we hope will hasten
 the arrival of a Vessell from Fort Erie, by whom
 a Person is expected from Philadelphia that
 was sent there an Express by the Commissioners
 from Niagara.- Some of our company kill'd
 one of the small black Rattle Snakes - there
 skin is much darker than the large sort, -
 they seldom exceed the length of 18 inches, and
 have but two or three Rattles - there bite, is
 is said to be very venomous, much more
 so than that of the larger kind. 9th. Last night arrived two of the Stockbridge
 Indians with letters from Hendrick their Chief, with
 by which we were informed that there seem'd to be
 a disposition in the Indian Council to admit
 the Commissioners to a Treaty, and giving it
 as his opinion that a Peace would be soon
 established.- We are further told that the
 place of Treaty is like to be altered from
 Sandusky to the mouth of the Miami, and
 that a Deputation from the Council may be
 expected to this day or tomorrow, who were are to give
 a favourable answer to the Commissioner's Speech
 and attend them to the place of Treaty - about
 10 oClock a Canoe with 7 Chipewa Indians from
 the Council, arrived here on their way home.
 --these people confirm the intelligence we received
 last night, and we are again fill 'd with the pleasing
 hope that this tedious and expensive Embassy will
 not be altogethe fruitless. 10th. Warm and sultry - anxiously waiting the
 return of the Indians. 11th. This morning arrived the Ottaway from
 Fort Erie, in her came Jasper Parrish who was
 sent an Express by the Commissioners from Niagara
 to Philadelphia. - he brought Letters for most of
 our friends, and News Papers as late as the
 20th of last month.- The Chippeway also came
 down from Detroit, bound to Fort Erie, and anchor'd
 near our Encampment.­ Friends had a Meeting
 this afternoon at Gros Isle, at which I was not
 present. 12th. Since we have been upon this spot we have
 experienced from a certain class of Men, a treatment
 very different from the generous politeness received
 from their brethren at Detroit, but have a hope
 that their ungenerous aspersions has not injured
 us individua1ly or brought any reproach upon the
 Society at large -- may their rude and ungenerous
 attempts serve to keen us more upon our guard
 and watchful over those weaknesses, which doubtless
 are more or less, the portion of human nature. 13th. In the Ottaway arrived Captain Wilbank 
 who came from the Southward with a party of
 Indians, as beforementioned he this day
 Dined with the Commissioners, and confirm'd
 what was noted as coming from him on the
 18th of last month, and gave a more full in-
-formation of the complaints of the Southern
 Indians, and of the attempts of the Spaniards to
 foment the difference subsisting between them
 and the United tates. 14th. In the forepart of last night had a
 sudden and heavy fall of rain which made
 our Tents very uncomfortable for the remainder
 of the night.- The Commissioners growing
 impatient at the delay of the Indians, sent
 off an Express to the Council in order
 to hasten their answer. 15th. Two Wiandots from the other side inform
 us that an Indian from the Council arrived
 last night at their Village with intelligence that
 there had been great debates among them res
 respecting the answer to be return'd to the
 Commissioners The Shawnese, Delawares, 
 Wiandots and Miami's being for war, and
 the Six Nations, on the Contrary, peacably inclined,
 that finally the Six Nations had prevail'd and
 messangers were to be dispatched three Nights
 ago with a favourable answer, and an invitation
 for the Commissioners to come forward.- One of
 the Wiandots abovementioned was a White Man
 taken by the Indians in his infancy, he cannot
 speak a word of English, he can give no or give any account
 of his Family; and only remembers that his
 Name was Honnes - His Ears were cut, and
 himself, in all respects, dress'd & ornamented
 in the Indian stile - dullness and stupidity
 seemed to be spread over his Countenance, and
 his whole appearance could not but raise
 emotions of sorrow and commiseration. 16th. About 4 P.M. the long look-for answer
 arrived which at once put an end to all
 to all hopes of a Peace at present - the
 substance of this lengthy reply, which fill'd
 near two sheets of Paper was, that no consi-
-deration would induce the Indians to
 give up their Country, and nothing short
 of making the Ohio the boundary could give
 them satisfaction, and if the Commissioners
 could not agree to this there would be no use
 in meeting at a Treaty - The answer was
 signed, it is said, by sixteen Nations, being
 all that were present except the Six
 Nations, who all refused their concurrence
 and are favourably disposed towards the
 United States.- About 8 P.M. the two
 young Onondaga's return'd who were
 sent express by the Commissioners, as
 mentioned the 14th, they brought no
 written reply, and could give very little in-
formation, except that they delivered their
 message to Capt. Brandt the Mohawk Chief,
 who informed that an answer to the Commissnr.
 Speech was already gone down, the purport
 of which he was intirely unacquainted with,
 as he, with the rest of the Six Nations, were
 not admitted into the Council - Thus ends
 a business in which, it is too probable, the fate
 of thousands are involved, - should there be
 any, who from interested motives, or mis-
-taken policy, have endeavoured to retard
 the work of Peace, and promote the horrid
 consequences attendant upon War, what
 will they not have to answer for! 17th. Struck our Tents and embarked our
 Baggage and Stoves on board the Dunmore-
 -the Wind being strong from the S.W., it
 was 4 in the afternoon before we got under
 way, when we work'd down with the-
 current into the Lake - in the evening
 we were about 10 miles from the place
 of our departure.- the wind about South. 18th. The wind shifting last night to the N.E. brought
 us up to the Bass Islands this morning, where we
 came to an anchor in Pudding Bay about 7 oClock,
 being 40 miles from the mouth of Detroit River­ about
 about 10 A.M. the wind shifted round to
 N.N.W., we made sail, and run through the
 Islands - in the afternoon it fell calm, at
6 in the evening we were about 10 miles below
the Islands.­ This being the first day p
 (and just 10 weeks since we passed the same Islands)
Friends had a Meeting in the Cabbin, which was
in the main a satisfactory time. 19th. Little wind all the last night, mostly
 from the N.E. - this morning almost
calm, the Bass Islands still in sight -
light airs of wind all Day from the Northward
- we made but little progress. 20th. Last night about 10 a fresh breeze
sprung up from the N. N. W. which conti-
nued untill this morning - the fore part
of the Day calm - at 1 P.M. a breeze sprung
up about N.B.E. about which time a Vessell
hove in sight a stern of us which we
suppose to be the Ottaway bound to Fort
Erie - at 4 P.M. close in with the Land
near the mouth of Elk River on the South
side of the Lake, - tack'd and stood to
the Northward 21st. A small breeze from the Eastward
 all night, - in the morning the South
Shore in sight - the Ottaway about 2
Leagues to Leeward - at 2 P.M the Land
on both sides the Lake in sight and the
 - at 4 P.M. the Ottaway
abreast of us, about half a mile to an
Windward. - the Wind N.N.E. 22nd. The wind last night hauld round to them Sou
South, and continued a fresh breeze untill
morning - Our Course E.N.E. - The Ottaway
on our Lee bow about 4 Leagues distant
- the Land in sight on both sides the Lake
- at 10 A.M opposite Long Point, from whence
 over to the opposite Shore, near Presq Isle, the
distance is about 12 Leagues - at 2 P.M.
 calm, no land to be seen to the Northward
 - at 4 P.M.a breeze sprung up about
South, which increased and blew
 fresh in the Evening. 23d. About 1 A.M. anchor'd at Fort Erie - the
 wind blowing hard all day made it very difficult
to Land which prevented our making much progress
in preparing to get on our way to Niagara 24th. Disposed of most of our spare Stores - Govr.
 Randolph and Col. Pickering crossd over to
Buffaloe Creek, intending to go through the Genesee
Country down to New York. J.Parrish , Ja.
 Lindley, J. Moore , & J. Elliott , also took their
leave of us, intending to proceed through the
woods to Philad. - General Lincoln , Ch.
 Storer, J.Heckenvelder , Dr. McCoskry , Wm.
 Savery & myself, intending to go by the way
Montreal to New York. 25th. Procured Batteaux in which we put our
Baggage and embark'd about 9 oClock down
to Chippeway Creek, within two miles of the
Great Fall, where we arrived about one - 
after Dinner J.Heckenvelder & myself went
to take a second view of the Falls, we went
down by Birch's Mill, and along under the
Hill to Table Rock, opposite the Falls, J.H. being
fatigued would go no further, I procured a guide
and went about a mile below to a place where
we f by the help of Indian Ladders we
decended down to the waters edge, and went
 along upon the broken Rocks up to the
Falls - The River to the Eastward of the Island
I suppose to be 250 yards wide, the lower end
 of the Island, and the River to the Westward of the
it, I suppose to be each of the same width, - After spending some time in viewing this
wonderful sight, we ascended the hill and walk'd
about three miles, where we got Lodgings and
tarried all Night. 26th. Walk'd down to the Landing where we found
General Lincoln , Wm. Savery & some others who came
 in a Waggon last night - about noon our
 our Baggage arrived and was deposited in
 the Kings Store. 27th. A Light Breeze of wind from the Westward,
 we could hear the roaring of the Falls uncommonly
loud, the distance being seven miles. - We
hear there is a Vessell at Navy Ha11 bound to
Kingston, but it is thought she will be detain'd
 untill they hear from Governor Simcoe who
 is on the opposite side of the Lake at Torento--
 28th. Procured a Batteau and went down
to Navy Hall, and were accommodated
with the Governor's empty House - the
evening being calm could distinctly clearly hear
 the roaring of the Falls as I lay in Bed,
the distance 18 miles 29th. Arrived the Missesaga, a Kings Scho
 Schooner, from Toronto, by her we learn
 that the Gun Boat, in which Captain
Bunbury was a Passenger, who left this
place the 23rd was not arrived at 7 oClock
last evening - as the wind blew hard
the night after she sail'd, we are fearful
some accident has befallen her. - The
 Sloop Caldwell being ready to Sail for Kingston
and there being a prospect of a Wind, we
 got all our Baggage on board this evening 30th. At 4 A.M. embark'd on board the
Vessell abovementioned, Commanded by
Captain Paxton , and left Niagara with
a fair Wind, bound for Kingston at the
 entrance of the River St. Lawrence, - having
a fresh breeze all Day, about 8 P.M were
a breast of long Point on the North sides
 of the Lake 100 miles from Niagara. 31st. This morning about 5 oClock pass'd
by the Islands call'd the Ducks, - Course from
 Niagara to the Islands about E.N.E., from
 thence to Kingston about N.b.E. - from the
 Islands to Kingston 28 m. whole distance
150 miles - At 10 oClock, anchor'd at
Kingston, formerly Fort Frontenac. - here
is a Fort and small Garrison, the Town consists
of a few scattering Houses, and the Land in
the neighbour'd appears to be very Stoney and
 poor. - A Batteau being procured we left
Kingston about 1 P.M., and having a fair
wind, run all Night. 9 mo. 1st. Went on Shore this morning
about 6 and breakfasted at a Tavern
three miles above Oswegatche, being 72
miles from Kingston. - The River St.
Lawrence for about 10 Leagues below
Kingston has no current, and but
a very gentle one the remainder
of the way to Oswegatche; from thence
it begins to be very rapid. - in the
afternoon we pass'd the Rapids call'd
the Long Sue, and about 6 oClock enter'd
 Lake St. Francis, which is 7 Leagues
in length and 2 wide two in breadth.
 - at 10 we were overtaken with a
 violent squall of Wind and Rain; and
 with difficulty got to land on the N.W.
 side, about 14 miles from the N.E. end
 of the Lake, where we left our Boat and
made up a fire on this Shore, and
spent a very uncomfortable Night 2nd. A fresh Breese from the Westward
 - embark'd about 6 A.M. and at 8 landed
 at Mclntire's at the N.E. end of the Lake
 where we got a little refreshment and then
proceeded on our way down the River, - about
one pass'd the Rapids of the Cedars, and
at 4 arrived at La Chine, where we took
up our Quarters at Grants Tavern, & tarried
all Night 3rd. Sent on two Carts with our Baggage
and about 9 A.M., in three Calathes, set
off for Montreal, where we arrived in
about an hour & a half. - Distance from
 Kingston to Montreal 200 miles - In the
afternoon that we left Kingston we run
about 30 miles before dark, and in all that
distance saw but very few settlements, the
Land appearing very rough and poor - the
next morning at day light, when we were
about 60 60 miles from Kingston, we found
the N.W. side of the River thickly inhabited,
 which continued to be the case all the way
down to Lake St. Francis, the improvements
are new, and the inhabitants mostly Loyalists
 and emigrants from different quarters,
 - after we got below the boundary Line
 which strikes the water somewhere on Lake
 St.Francis, we found improvements on
both sides, but the N.W. side of the Lake
being low and Marshy swampy had but few settle­
ments, on the S.E. side appeared more
pleasant, and better cultivated. - The
Country on both sides the River, below
the Lake, is thickly inhabited, especially
 on the West side, where the Land appears
to be fertile and well improved. - The
 Rapids in this River are not easily de-
scribed, - those of Long Sue, and the Cedars
are the most remarkable, in one of
which we went 3 Leagues in 35 minutes
 and the in the other the same distance
in 40 minutes.- Opposite La Chine,
which is 9 miles from Montreal, is a
large Indian Town, the Houses appear'd
to be commodious & well built, a large
Church, or Chappel, standing in the Town,
and another building of the like kind, 3 or
 four miles from it. - La Chine is a
 Village situated on the same Island on
which Montreal is built, to this place all
Goods intended for the Western Trade is
brought by Land from Montreal, & from
thence sent by Batteaux, Canoe's &c in
many directions into the Indian Country.
- in the River St.Lawrence, between Kingston
and the Lake St. Francis are a vast mul-
titude of Islands, most of which are small,
barren, and Rocky. - The Country in
the Neighborhood of Montreal appears
to be very thickly inhabited, fertile &
 pleasant. - The Town is about half
 the size of New York, the buildings mo
 mostly of stone, some of the Houses
are roof'd with Tin plates, and in
general are pretty well built, - some
of the Streets are commodious and well
paved, - it appears to have a plentiful
Market, and provision, in general,
 about the same price as in New York
 - after dining at Montreal we cross'd
the River at Longuiel Ferry, intending
to proceed on our way to Lake Champlain
 immediately, but it being in the heigth of
their Oat Harvest, we were disappointed
in getting Carriages, and were obliged
to take up our Quarters at the Ferry-
House for the Night. 4th. We were provided with Carriages &
 about 6 in the morning set off for
 St. Johns, in our way pass'd by Fort
 Chamblee, in which is a Garrison, and
about 12 oClock arrived at St.John's, the
distance being 27 miles. - Chamblee is
situated at the foot of the Rapids of the
River Sorrell, which runs out of Lake
Chamblain, at St. Johns, into the River
St. Lawrence, from Chamblee to St. Johns
 is a carrying place of about 12 miles, the
road very good. - about 5 P.M. embark'd
on board a Boat of about 9 Tons burthen,
Sloop rigg'd, and Deck'd, it being almost
 Calm, got only 5 miles on our way, and
 went on Shore, at a very ordinary Public House
where we tarried all night. 5th. Embark'd about about 7 A.M. - the wind
being ahead, we work'd up about 9 miles
to a Tavern One mile below the Isle aux
Noix, where we put up for the Night. 6th. Set off about 7 A.M., had to stop and
give an account of ourselves at the Fort on
 the Isle aux Noix - the Wind coming fair
about 11 oClock we got up the Lake to where
the boundary Line intersects it in 45° of
 N. Lattitude, - the Country on the East side
of the Lake appears pleasant & fertile, & thickly
settled on both sides of the Line, - on the
West side also are many settlements, but
not so flourishing as on the East. - about
One oClock pass'd the Brittish Garrison on Point
au Fair, and also the Kings Schooner laying
in the Lake opposite to it, to both of which
the master of the Boat was obliged to give
some account of himself and his Cargo. -- at 4 P.M. we arrived at Cumberland
head in the State of New York, where a
 Custom House is established, here also,
our little Vessell underwent another exa
 examination.- Our Skipper being
very ill with the Ague & Fever, desired
to be left here, and gave up the manage-
ment of his Boat to the Passengers, & a
 little Boy about 14 or 15 Years of Age, as a Pilot.
 - the wind being fair and blowing very
fresh we were loth to loose it, & ventured
to push on, being told we could make
a harbour at Gillilands Creek about 20
miles further up the Lake, at which
place we arrived about 8 in the evening,
but in attempting to go in we found a
 Bar quite a Cross the Creeks mouth, on
which we got a Ground,
 and the wind
blowing fresh, with a pretty high Sea
we struck hard, - it was with a good
deal of difficulty that we got our Boat off
which when we had accomplished, not 
 liking to trust any longer to our pilot, we
came to an Anchor, pretty much exposed
to the Wind and Sea, and pass'd a very
 uncomfortable Night, having 12 Men and
one Woman on board. 7th. As soon as day light appear'd we made
sail, and run 12 miles to Bason harbour,
 on the Vermont side where we breakfasted
- at 9 oClock pass'd the old Fort of Crown
Point, 12 miles from Bason harbour - at 3 P.M
pass 'd through the Piers opposite the remains
of Ticonderoga, and at 7 in the evening got
up to cold spring, a public Hquse within 8
miles of Skeensborough. - The Shores of this
Lake are mostly high and bold, and the
Country on both sides has by far a pleasanter
appearance than any we saw on the
upper Lakes - there are settlements all
round Lake Champlaine, those towards
the North end, and in general, on the East,
or Vermont Side, appear to have the pre
 preference - At the South end of the Lake, on
 on both sides, the Country is very Rocky
 and Mountainous - From Ticonderoga
to Skeensborough, the distance of 25 miles,
 the Lake is like a narrow River, with
very high Cliffs on both sides, in some
 places much resembling the High Lands
 on Hudsons River. - About 12 miles below
 Skeensboroug the River is contracted between
large Bodies of Marsh, which continue
nearly all the way up, - among these
Swam Marshes were great numbers of
 Ducks of different kinds, but mostly
what are call'd Wood Ducks 8th. We arrived at Skeensborough about
11 oClock, the distance being 150 miles
 from St. Johns - at Skeensborough are
fine Mills upon the Falls of Wood Creek
where it empties into the east end of
Lake Champlain, - the Land, in general
very rough & Mountainous, in which
are some fertile Vallies. 9th. Having procured two waggons to bring
our Baggage, six of us set off about 7
 in the Stage Waggon for Albany. - We
pass'd the remains of Fort Ann & Fort
 Edward, the first 11, the latter 24 miles from
Skeensborough, - about 8 in the evening
arrived at Saratoga on the North River, 35 miles from Skeensbugh.
 and 36 miles from Albany 10th. We left Saratoga about 6 A.M.and reach'd
Lansingburg about 2 P.M. where we dined,
 - our ride this morning has been all the
way in a very pleasant Road on the banks
of Hudsons River - we pass'd through so
some beautiful Villages, particularly the
half Moon, or Waterford, on the west side
of the River, about a Mile above Lansing-
bourg, which is situated on the East side,
they both appear to be places of considerable
Trade, and from the number of new buildings
erecting, very rapidly increasing in size
and beauty, - the same may be said
of Troy which stands a few miles below
 Lansingbourg on the same side of the River
 where we again Ferried over and arrived at
Albany about 5 oClock - Lansingbourgh 9 m. from Albany. 11th. Our Baggage arrived this afternoon
and was put on board the Sloop Vley, Capt.
Marseilles, who expects to sail tomorrow for
New York. 12th. Left Albany about 10 oClock, with a
fine wind, and very shortly after, ran
aground upon the Oversloughs about
two Miles below, where all our exert
exertions to get off this Tide proved in
vain. 13th. Not being able to get the Vessell off at
high water last night, this morning
made a Raft of the boards upon Deck
by which means and a great deal of
 labour got off a float and run down
over the shoals, and came to an Anchor
 in order to take in our Raft of Boards.
 - about 4 P.M. again made sail,
the Wind, which for several days past
has been strong from the Northward, is
now almost done. 14th. Light airs of wind from the southwd.
 - pass'd Hudson in the Night, which is
 30 miles from Albany - at 8 A.M. opposite
Katskill on the west side of the River 40 miles
 from Albany, - in the evening lay at Red
 Hook wharf, on the East side of the River 45
miles from Albany. 15th. Small breeses of Wind still from the S.ward
 - in the Morning found ourselves at Anchor
opposite Usopus, on the West side, 100 miles
 from New York, - work'd down with the Ebb.
 and anchor'd in the evening about 4 miles
above Poughkeepsie, on the East side, which
 is call'd half way from Albany to New York 16. Wind the same as Yesterday - in the
morning we lay along side a Lime Kiln
 wharf opposite the mouth of Wappings Cr
Creek, 6 miles below Newburgh - about 1 oClock
 pass'd Newburg on the West side of the River,
 opposite to which on the east side of the River is
 the Fish Kills - New Windsor lays about one
 mile below Newburgh, on the same side
of the River - two or three miles below New W
 New Windsor, we enter the High Lands, &
 anchor'd during the Flood, about 2 miles above
West Point. 17th. Having a strong Current in
the Night we pass'd, West Point, and
Stoney Point, Forts, and got clear of the
High Lands about 4 o'clock in the Morning
at which time we were overtaken with
a heavy squall of wind & Rain from the
 Northward - about 8 we were opposite
Tappan - the wind still continuing we
 arrived at New York about 1 in the
afternoon Following the Journal are 33 blank pages. and then 3 pages and the back cover. upon which is written the following 1793
