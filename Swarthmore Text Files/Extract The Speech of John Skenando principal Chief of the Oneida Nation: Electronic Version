 The Speech of John Scanada principal Chief
 of the Oneida Nation; at the time when they first
 discovered that their improvements the Castle had
 been sold to the State by the intrigue of some
 white men and unknown to the Indians all
 the Indians in the were crying & lamenting
 on the occasion My warriors and my Children hear
 it is cruel it is very cruel a heavy burden lies on
 my heart and it is very sick this is a dark day
 the clouds are black and heavy over the Oneida
 Nation a strong arm lies heavy upon us, and
 our hearts grown under it- our fires are put out
 and our beds removed under us the graves
 of our Fathers are destroyed, and their Children
 are driven are driven away The Almighty God
 is angry with us for we have been wicked,
 therefore his arm doth not keep us Where are
 the Chiefs of the rising sun, white chiefs now
 kindle their ancient fires There no Indian
 sleeps, but those that are sleeping in their
 graves my house will soon be like theirs, soon
 will a white Chief here kindle this fire
 Scanada will soon be no more, and his village
 no more a village of Indians The news that
 was brought by our men last night from
 Albany hath made this a sick day in Oneida
 all our hearts are sick, and our eyes rain like 
the black cloud when it roars on the tops of
 the trees of the wilderness Long did the strong
 voice of Scanada cry, Children take care, be
ware, be straight his feet were then like the
 deer's, and his arm like the bear's; he now
 can only mourn out a few words and then
 be silent and his voice will soon be heard
 no more in Oneida But certainly he will
 long be in the minds of his children, in white
 men's minds Scanada's name hath gone
 far, and will not die He hath spoken
 many words to make his Children straight:
 long hath he said, drink no strong water, for
 it makes you mice for white people who are
 cats many a meal have they eaten of you
 their mouth is a snare, and their way like
 the fox their lips are sweet, but their hearts
 are wicked yet there are good whites and 
good Indians The ground where their church stands, and their
 burying place is included in the stole
