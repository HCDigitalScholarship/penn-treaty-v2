 & Stephen Gardner from North Carolina and David Sand The Committee to confer with our friend John Dean , not being
 ready to report are continued- The Committee to whom was referred (back) the essayed letter
 to the Chiefs Sackem, and Speakers of the Oneida South
 settlement report further attention, and produced an essay
which was read and with some alterations appeared; and is
 as follows -- Viz To the Chiefs Sachems, and Speaker of the 
 Oneida South Settlement- Brothers!
 Your letter of 8th month last was reciev'd
 and read amongst us. We rejoice to hear of your welfare 
 and of the resolution you have made to refrain from strong 
 drinks, it is a good beginning towards your improvement and 
 we have no doubt as you keep to it, you will be able to 
 cultivate your lands better, and by industry soon live more more comfortably on the fruits thereof-
 Brothers! that you may be able to keep these good
 resolutions, we wish you to attend very carefully to what the 
 good Spirit teaches in the heart, for it is placed there as 
 a guide to show what to do and what to leave undone and
 to lead you and us to virtue and happiness agreeable 
 to what you will find written in that good book which
 your Brother sent you from over the great water. And altho'
 you may not now comprehend some of the mysteries con
 tained in that excellent book, yet, as you become more 
 and more disposed to listen to the voice of the gret and 
 good Spirit in your hearts, your minds will gradually
 be enlighten'd to understand the things written therein,
 so far as is necessary for you- We are also glad to find that the subject of
 the education of your Children preposed to you by our
 friends who visited you last summer, has been consider'd
 by you, and that you are desirous to have a school
 establish'd amongst you- We wish to encourage you
 in this good work and shall willing by advise and assist
 you in it, believing it of great importance to your
 offspring whose fertile minds like a well cultivated soil, 
 will yield a rich harvest and amply compensate you
 for the labour and expence bestowed on them. They will 
 thereby be rendered more comfortable to themselves and their
 families and useful in the increasing intercourse you 
 will unavoidably have with the white people by 
 whom you are surrounded- Brothers! We often think of you your wives and
 little ones with love and good wishes, and at this time 
 conclude with desires that the good and Almighty
 Father of all Nations on the Earth may by your God
 and as we have already said that you may constantly
 attend to the teachings of his pure Spirit in your hearts. And are unitedly your aff. friends

 On behalf of the Committee
 on the Indian Concern New York5th Mo. 25th. 1807 The Clerk is directed to transcribe the foregoing, and Th P Franklin ,
 Gideon Seaman , John Murray Jun , Isaac Thorn Jun ; James Mott ,
 Anna Willis , Lydia Mott , Anne Merritt , and Esther Griffin 
are appointed to sign it on our behalf Our Our attention minds being at this time solidly impressed
 with solicitude for the promotion and welfare of our Indian 
 brethren and Sisters, and a renewal of concern is witnessed 
 for them in their tried situations; which led to the prospect
 of usefulness that may result from the appointment of a 
 few friends to make another visit to those Tribes which 
 have particularly demanded our care, including Stockbridge,
 Brothertown, and the Oneidas- And to which service the
 following friends are appointed separated- Viz James Mott , Esther
 Griffin, Anne Mott , Mathew Franklin , Samuel Mott ,
 Isaac Thorne Jun , Hannah Field , and Charity Rotch , 
 who are requested to attend thereto as early as way shall 
 open for them, and endeavour to afford them such ad
vice and assistance as they may feel themselves qualified
 for; they are also instructed with our letter directed to
 part of the Oneida Tribe, with directions to lay it before
 them at a suitable opportunity The Clerk is directed to furnish the Committee with
 a copy of the foregoing minutes
 The Committee thereto appointed now produced an essay
 of a report to the yearly Meeting, which was read, and with
 some alterations approved- And is as follows- Viz To the Yearly Meeting We the Committee on the concern rela
tive to the Indian Natives Report! That during the course of the 
 last season Year the subject hath from time to time claimed our close
 attention, and our minds have felt much engaged for the prom
otion of their civil and religious welfare: two Men and two Women
 of our number have made them a visit, and spent some time
 amongst the different Tribes and by their report we find, that
 notwithstanding they have made considerable advances in Agricu
lture and civilization in general yet owing to divers of their 
 Chiefs and others given way to the pernicious practice of drinking
 to excess, their progress in these respects is much retarded, and this
 weakness we fear has with some of them rather increased, yet
 it appears that many of the Oneida have wholly refrained
 from the use of ardent spirits, and although they have made
 less advancement in civilization than the other Tribes yet 
 they seem animated to labour after further improvement
 both civil and religious- The attention of the Committee
 has been turned for some time to the subject of encouraging
 some suitable Friend to reside amongst them, and John 
 Deane having expressed a willingness to go for a time in 
New York 25th of 5th Month 1807
 Signed on behalf of the
 Committee by Th P Franklin Clk
 in order to forward their improvement in agriculture & as far
 as he may be enabled, the proposal was agreeable to us, and
 he has accordingly removed this Spring with his family to
 reside at Brothertown-There are two Schools at Stock
 bridge taught by their own people, At Brothertown there 
 are also two, one of which is taught by a White Man, and the
 other for the females by an Indian Woman, and many of
 the Children at both places have made considerable adva
nces in school learning-At Oneida there is as yet no
 school, but the subject of establishing one is under cons
ideration-In taking a view of the concern in its various
 stages, the Committee are induced to believe, that altho
 the intemperate use of Spiritous liquors continues as above
 stated to retard their progress in many respects, yet 
 that the care of friends has been, and still may be
 useful to this people- New York 25th of 5th Month 1807

 Henry Drinker 
 Thomas Stewardson We were favoured with your com
 munication on the concern relative to the Indians under our 
 care addressed to John Murray , together with the documents acc 
accompanying it, and may inform, that the subject has, 
 since it originated in this Yearly Meeting in 1795 continued
 to engage our attention, that frequent visits have been made
 to the Brothertown, Stockbridge, and Oneida Tribes with
 some occasional assistance as far as our funds admitted, but
 we have not hitherto been able from a variety of causes,
 to make such progress in promoting their civilization and 
 improvement in Agriculture as is desirable- We are however encouraged to believe that our continued care 
 towards that People will be acceptable, and increasingly useful, as a
 friend and his family have lately been disposed to remove and settle
 amongst them at Brothertown: and should their situation be ren
dered so comfortable as to induce them to remain, it is hoped, from
 the suitableness of their qualifications, and the lively interest
 they have manifested, for the welfare of this people, they will be
 very instrumental in carrying into effect the objects contemplated, 
 of bettering their condition and increasing useful knowledge
 amongst them- We acknowledge the attention and respect
 manifested by friends in Philadelphia towards us as it
 relates to the interesting concern for the Indian Natives, which 
 we believe is one that will be more and more blessed to them,
 and the prosecution of it under right direction prove a source of
 of increasing satisfaction to friends engaged in it
 We have been less particular in communicating to you
 on paper the steps we have taken in order to promote the
 views of our Yearly Meeting relative to the welfare of this
 people, as we have been favoured with the company of
 several brethren of your Committee, with whom some of ours
 have confer'd and pretty fully opon'd the state of the concern
 with us, and who will be able to give you such further
 information as may be requisite- Signed by direction and on behalf of the Committee

 The Letter of the Committee of your Yearly
 Meeting on the Indian concern, dated on the 27th day of the
 5th mo: signed by thee on their behalf, was lately consider'd by
 a Committee of our Meeting for Sufferings, to whose particular
 care and attention the right appreciation of the Donation
 of our Friends in England had been refin'd, they on
 perusing your written communication & hearing several
 of our brethren, Members of our Indian Committee, who

ttergood and Emmor Kimber 
 two 
 two of the Committee appointed to visit the Indians
 inform that four of their number have made them a 
 visit; and the following is their report- Viz Agreeable to appointment, we have paid a 
 visit to each of the Indian Tribes under the particular
 care of this Yearly Meeting, and which with those at
 Brothertown our minds were affected with the increas
ing use of Spiritous liquors, and its baneful effects in
 retarding their civil and religious improvement; yet not
 without a consoling belief, that the labour hitherto
 bestowed on this People has not been altogether vain,
 and that from the residence of John Dean 
 and family amongst them these is a prospect of increasing
 usefulness by a continued extension of care, parti
cularly in the education of their Children, which
 Thomas Dean seems deeply interested in, and qualif
yed for, as well as to be useful to them in other respects:
 in both elder and younger ranks there are those
 who are industrious and sober, and from the religious
 sensibility some of them manifest; we were induced to hope
 they would continue to be good examples to their brethren. At Stockbridge the same evil of drinking to excess was
 painfully prevalent amongst the Men, consequently the pro
gress of civilization is slow. There are however a few of them,
 and the Women generally in this Tribe who are careful to
 avoid this pernicious practice, for whom we felt much sym
pathy, and who expressed their of the kindness ma
nifested towards them by friends with gratitude and
 affection. They have two Schools amongst them both
 taught by Natives; and seem disposed as well as those
 of Brothertown to place their Children among the whites
 that they may improve in the arts of civilized life; and
 we have been united in the sentiment that the greatest
 probability of our being permanently useful to this Peo
ple is from the instruction to be given the rising genera
tion. To the Oneida south settlement our visit was not
 satisfactory for want of a suitable Interpreter, yet they
 seemed desirous of having a School opened, but not
 having expected to make any other provision for the supp
ort of a Teacher than the appropriation of two hundred Acres
 of of Land, they concluded to take the subject again into
 consideration and inform us of the result. On enquiry
 we found this Tribe continued their resolution of abstai
ining from Spiritous liquors; and the Epistle addressed
 to them by the Committee was received wih evident marks
 of satisfaction. We were discouraged seeking an opportunity
 with those of the Oneidas called the Christian party,
 from the difficulty of being properly understood, and
 the habit of intoxication being so general and excessive
 as almost to preclude the idea of its being of any 
avail- Signed James Mott John Murray Jun Esther Griffin Anne Mott The Committee also produced the following Acct. Viz

 School, they are at liberty to engage him, and afford him
 such encouragement as they may think proper- Notwithstanding, things are not altogether as pleasant amo

vours (or we may be favoured with) for the promotion of
 their civil and religious improvement; and now adjourn

 we have received from him with Peter G Stuyvesant's 
 bond and Mortgage dated 8 mo 18th 1807 payable in one
 year with lawful interest from date for Four Thousand
 Dollars, which with the Books & Papers we have delivered

 Samuel Parsons The subject of procuring a School Master for the
 Oneidas referred from a previous sitting being again
 considered, the Clerk is directed to forward Copies of
 the following Minute to the several Quarterly Meetings
 in the Yearly Meeting with a view of engaging the attention
 of Friends on the subject, to wit- The Committee under whose care the Yearly Meeting has
 placed its concern relative to the Indian natives, in their
 deliberations from time to time on this important subject
 have been led to apprehend that in order to be more
 extensively useful to that people the attention of Friends
 should be particularly turned to the Young & rising
 Generation who are in great want of suitable instruction
 and as a friend and his family have for some time
 resided with the Brothertown Tribe, whose services have
 been found very useful to them, and the want of
 similar assistance in the Oneida Tribe is sensibly
 felt, we are now induced to spread the subject in
 this manner with the view of encouraging a friend &
 his wife particularly, or a single man, who may feel
 their minds disposed to go & reside amongst that Tribe
 for a time for the purpose of instructing their Children &
 aiding the endeavours of the Committee in the promotion of
 their civilization & welfare. Report to the Yearly Meetg. see 2d page back. To the Yearly Meeting The Committee on the concern relative to the Indians
 have not been unmindful of the trust reported in them,
 and although the progress of this people in civilization and
 moral improvement may not be equal to our solicitude
 for their welfare, yet we continue impressed with a sense of
 the ratitude of the cause, and
 of our duty to move in it as
 way may open in the clearness. Since our last report a
 visit has been made by four of our number to the
 Brothertown, Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes, in each of
 which there were individuals of both sexes who were disposed
 to lead lives of sobriety & industry, although some of the
 men were habituated to intemperance, hence they neglected
 the cultivation of their lands & the mechanic arts. At Brothertown the residence of John Dean & his family
 there is a prospect of thier becoming a more improved
 people, and from the report of the Committee we are
 induced to believe that the endeavors of our said friend
 & his family will prove useful in divers respects. In the Stockbridge Tribe as heretofore it may be
 observed there appears to be a number of religiously inclined
 women who manifested much satisfaction with the
 company of Friends. The Oneidas compasing that division of the Tribe
 called the Pagan Party & residing in the south part
 of the settlement were particularly noticed by the Committee
 they being generally considered as sober persons, mostly
 abstaining from the use of strong drink : they appeared
 very desirous of our furnishing them with a School Master
 and we gave them some encouragement that we would look
 out for one, and bear a reasonable proportion of the
 expence with which they appeared satisfied; we have
 attended thereto but have not yet succeeded in procuring
 a friend for that purpose, and are thence induced to
 offer the subject to the consideration of Friends at large,
 with a view that it may lead to the attainment of this
 desirable object: This Tribe had been solicited to accept
 of a School master from some other Society, but
 refused, assigning as a reason that they preferred
 a friend to any other. There is a School at
 Brothertown, conducted by Thomas Dean , son of the
 
Friend, who resides in the Tribe, & two at Stockbridge 
taught by natives. The Committee apprehend that the
 principal concern of friends should be turned towards
 the education of their children & to procuring proper places
 for them, where they may be brought up in a virtuous
 line of life, and in such occupations as may be best calculated
 to promote their improvement & welfare. Signed by direction & The Committee in the course of its deliberations on the
 concern for the welfare of the Indian natives, which was felt
 to be renewedly interesting was engaged to turn its attention to
 separate a number of Friends to make a visit to the
 Brothertown, Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes, with the view
 of promoting thier moral improvement & advancement in the
 arts of civilized life, and Thomas Willis , Thos Rotch ,
 Gideon Seaman , James Mott , Abraham J. Underhill , 
 Matthew Franklin , Lydia P Mott , Elizabeth Byrd ,
 Hannah Field , Esther Griffin & Elizabeth Bowne are
 appointed to the service. Adjourned to 8'o'clock tomorrow evening at this House. At a Meeting of the Committee 27th of the 5 mo The Committee being informed by some friends named to
 that service at last sitting that they have had an interview
 with the Friend, who had mentioned a prospect of going
 to reside in the Oneida Tribe, with the view of teaching their
 Children & promoting the object of the concern, & after a
 conference with him, they think it right to propose to the
 Committee that he be left at liberty to go with the Friends
 separated to make the Indians a visit, & if it should
 appear to them suitable, they they be authorized to encourage
 his remaining in that situation; which after deliberate
 consideration the Committee unites with. The attention of the Committee was turned to consider
 of the situation of the Indian Natives on the Eastern part
 of Long Island, and resulted in appointing a Committee
 to make them a visit & inspect into their situation & to this
 service the following friends are appointed, Thomas
 Willis, Samuel Parsons , Matthew Franklin , Anne 
 Willis, Catherine Murray & Elizabeth Bowne . Adjourned to meet at Purchase Meeting House at 3'o'clock
 in the afternoon of the 8th of 11 mo next At a Special Meeting of the Committee in New York
15th of 9th Month 1808 Information being received that the Friend who
 proposed residing amongst the Oneidas in the capacity of
 School Master had declined going, the attention of the
 Committee was turned to procure a Friend for that
 situation, and also a suitable family to aid the endeavors
 of the Committee in the promotion of the welfare of that
 Tribe; and Samuel Titus , James Mott , John Murray ,
 Willet Hicks , Shadrach Ricketson , John Burrow ,
 Samuel Parsons , Richard Mott , Matthew Franklin ,
 Elizabeth Bowne , Catharine Murray & Jane King 
 are appointed to take such steps as may appear to them
 advisable to further the views of the Committee herein,
 and they are authorized to afford such pecuniary aid
 as they may judge suitable. At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian Concern
 held at Purchase 1st of 11 mo 1808 Present 17 members The Committee appointed to make a visit to the 
Brothertown, Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes made the
 following report, viz In a late visit made to the Indians under the care of
 our Yearly Meeting by three of the Committee the recent
 appointed with one not under the appointment, it was evident
 that although divers of the Brothertown Tribes, continue
 in the habit of drinking to excess & are thereby prevented
 making much improvement in agriculture, yet there are
 many others in this Nation & particularly those of the
 younger class who refrain from excessive drinking &
 are making considerable advancement in improving their
 lands, in some instances to a degree beyond what we
 had an idea; that on the whole we think there is an
 encouraging prospect in the nation, & which we attribute
 very much to the care & exertions of John Dean & he
 saw, by one of whom a School is continued & likely to
 be enlarged on a plan more extensively useful Among those of Stockbridge there are a number of
 families who appear to be sober & industrious, & have
 improved their lands & provided themselves comfortable
 houses & accommodations; & there are divers particularly
 of the women, who appear to be serious & religiously
 thoughtful. They have two Schools taught by
 
Indians, but several of their Chiefs men of abilities for
 extensive usefulness among them are very intemperate &
 set a bad example in other respects; that from this & 
other causes, the present prospect in this nation is rather
 discouraging. The Oneida Nation are divided into two Companies,
 & settled in different parts of their land & of late a division
 thereof has taken place between them; and part of them
 called Christians are generally given to excessive drinking
 & pay very little attention to improving their lands & have
 lately sold a considerable part of their tract to government
 & seem much unsettled & inclining to remove to the Westerward
 where they can follow hunting their unsual course of life:
 that there appears to be but little prospect of doing much
 advantageously for these. But the other part of
 this Tribe called Pagans seem settled & very generally
 abstain from the use of ardent spirit; with them in
 a collective capacity we had a satisfactory opportunity of
 conference; they expressed great satisfaction in the care
 extended towards them by friends & also an intention on
 their part to pursue their advice & appeared very desirous
 to be furnished with a School Master & a man & his
 wife to instruct them in thier farming & family concerns
 offering the use of a house for a family that may settle
 among them with some improved land and as much
 more uncultivated land as such friends wish to improve,
 they will also build a school house & give their part of
 the annuity appropriated by Government for the
 support of a School Master, but the improvements
 Friends may make on their lands are to be left when
 friends leave there unpaid for by the Indians; & it
 appearing to us that there was such a favorable
 opening for settling a friend & his wife & a schoolmaster
 among them, that we thought it advisable to accept
 the houses they afford & its wanting some repairs to
 make it comfortable for a family, we procured
 materials & agreed with a Carpenter to do the work,
 Thomas Dean engaging to superintend the business;
 to accomplish these repairs & some necessary expences
 while at Oneida use advanced Nineteen pounds. the report obtained the solid attention of the Comtt
 & afforded encouragement to persevere in the promotion of the concern *By a minute of the last Yearly Meeting of Women
 friends it appears that Jemima Bunken & Sarah
 Talcott are appointed Members of this Committee. * And the Treasurer is directed to pay James Mott the
 sum of Nineteen Pounds therein mentioned
 The Committee appointed to make a visit to the Indians
 on Long Island made the following report viz We, of the Committee appointed to make a visit to the
 Indian Natives on the Eastern part of Long Island
 report That in pursuing the object of our appointment
 we found but two settlements that appeared to claim out
 attention, which was more particularly directed to the
 situation of the Montauk Tribe on the Eastern
 extremity of the Island into which we have made
 careful inspection; we found them compasing a settlement
 of about seventeen houses & wigwams & numbering about
 Eighty five individuals, of whom a considerable part is absent;
 amongst those who remain is a number of ancient widows
 whose situation excited our sympathy This Tribe have the occupancy during the season of
 tillage of a very fertile tract of land of about a Thousand
 Acres, which they improve to less advantage than we could
 desire being too generally indolent, averse to applying them
selves to husbandry & much addicted to the use of ardent
 Spirits; a number of their young men are engaged
 in fishing & whaling & a considerable proportion of their
 youth placed out in the neighbouring town of East
 Hampton for the purpose of receiving education &
 acquiring the knowledge of useful business; owing to this
 & other circumstances they have no School amongst them,
 though they have a good building erected for that use
 of latter years The Shinicock Tribe situated about thirty five
 Miles farther westward has become so mixed with
 colored people that there does not appear to be more
 than three families of unmixed Indians, their
 number is nearly the same as the Montauk Tribe,
 but owing to the want of wood, the poor quality of
 their land & some difficulties attending its cultivation,
 they have mostly left their settlement on the plain, &
 are scattered amongst the neighbouring white people
 their Meeting House, formerly in the midst of the
 settlement, is still standing open & exposed to the weather 2d of 10 mo 1808

 consideration of the subject taking place produced the
 expression of sympathy with their situation; farther
 attention to the subject is referred to our next Meeting;

 articles to the Indians amounting to Four pounds 12

produced the essay with alterations which was approved,
 & James Mott & Catharine Murray are appointed to
 sign it on behalf of the Committee & lay it before the 
 Yearly Meeting; it is as follows To the Yearly Meeting The Committee under whose care the concern relative to
 the civilization & welfare of the Indians is placed,
 continue to feel interested in the work & desirous of
 using every suitable means to promote the object of
 their appointment. Several of their number have made a visit to
 the Brothertown, Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes since
 last Year, by their report, we find, that at
 Brothertown although divers of them are very
 intemperate, yet there are many others & particularly
 amongst the younger class who refrain from excessive
 drinking & are making considerable advancement in
 improving their lands, to which we believe the care
 & exertions of John Dean & family have greatly
 contributed; his son teaches a School in that place 
which is expected to be continued and on a plan that
 appeared likely to be more extensively useful At Stockbridge there are a number of families who
 appear to be sober and industrious, provide themselves
 comfortable houses & accommodations & have two Schools
 taught by Indians. The Oneida are divided into two Companies, one of
 which are generally given to excessive drinking; they have
 lately sold a considerable tract to Government & seem
 much unsettled & inclined to remove to the Southward
 where they can follow hunting their usual course
 of life; consequently there appears but little prospect
 of doing much advantageously for them. The other part of the Tribe known by the name
 of the Oneida South settlement very generally abstain from
 the use of ardent Spirits, and with them in a collective
 capacity the Committee had a very satisfactory conference;
 the expressed great satisfaction in the care extended
 towards them by friends & an intention to follow their
 advice. Although this Tribe have not made 
so much progress in the cultivation of the earth as some
 others, yet from the disposition for improvement which
 they manifest, we are encouraged to persevere in our
 attention towards them; and a friend & his wife,
 (Absalom & Ruth Hatfield ) offering to go & reside
 amongst them & endeavor to instruct them in agricultural
 & domestic concerns, it was approved & they are now
 settled there for that purpose The attention of the Committee has also been
 turned to the Indians on Montauk Point, Long
 Island & a visit made them, and we are induced to
 believe they are entitled to the further care of Friends. The Committee have received a proportion of
 the liberal donation of Friends in England for the
 purpose of improving the situation of the Indians,
 by which means they have been enabled to extend their
 views for their benefit, which the want of Friends had
 hitherto prevented. In closing this report we are willing to add that
 in our deliberations on this interesting subject we have
 
been encouraged by the consoling belief that the labor already
 bestowed has not been in vain & renewedly strengthened to
 continue our endeavors to promote the welfare of this People
 by an unshaken confidence in the rectitude of the cause
 & a firm persuasion that the excercise of benevolence
 remains to be a Christian duty. Signed &c. The Committee to procure a Teacher to reside amongst
 the Oneidas report attention thereto & a prospect of obtaining
 one; they are continued with James Mott, Anne Merritt ,
 Lydia Mott, , Catharine Murray & Phebe Field added &
 they are authorized to agree with a suitable friend &
 desired to give early attention thereto The attention of the Committee was engaged in the
 consideration of making an appointment to visit the
 Brothertown, Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes, with a view
 of promoting the welfare & improvement of the
 Indians & rendering such advice & assistance to the
 friends resident there, as occasion may require &
 to this service the following friends are appointed viz.

 Present 33 members The situation of the Montauk Tribe coming

 subject resulted in making an appointment to visit
 them & to extend their notice to the Shinecock Tribe
 & such other as they may judge have a claim
 thereto; and Gideon Seaman , Robert Bowne ,
 Andrew Cock , Saml. Parsons , Elizabeth Byrd , Elizabeth
 Bowne, Martha Willis are appointed
 to that service Adjourned to the 1st of 8th mo at four 'o'clock in the afternoon
 at Purchase Meeting House Minute omitted above The Treasurer is directed to pay to Thomas
 Franklin the sum of forty five Dollars advanced by him
 in the Year 1801 for promotion of object of this
 concern At a Meeting of the Committee at Purchase 1 of 8 mo
 1809 Only 7 of the Committee being present it was
 concluded to adjourn to the 13th of 2 mo next at 6'o'clock
 in the evening at Pearl Street Meeting House in 
 New York. At a Special Meeting of the Committee on the 
Indian Concern, held at West Chester9th of 10 mo 1809 Present 20 Members The Committee appointed to visit the Indian Tribes
 in the Western parts of this State, made a report in 
writing, which is in substance as follows- viz To the Committee on the Concern relative to the
 Indians We of the Sub Committee appointed to pay a
 visit to the Indians, have proceeded on that
 appointment report. That we first visited
 those at Brothertown & called to see a number of
 them in their huts & houses, some of which were very
 comfortable & showed the effects of industry & sobriety;
 others & by much the largest proportion are still
 habituated to intemperance & neglect the improvement
 of their land;
 there are in this settlement
 twelve framed houses & ten barns & the number
 of inhabitants about three hundred, including men,
 women & children Being several days at
 John Dean's , we had an opportunity of discovering
 their situation & qualifications for usefulness among
 this people, which produced a conviction on our
 minds that they are an acquisition to them & the
 Indians appear very generally to consider them in
 the most favorable point of view. It is with
 much satisfaction that we have it in our power to
 state that the Superintendants place the fullest 
confidence in John & Thomas Dean ; that they are
 disposed to encourage the School in a way quite satisfactory
 as also to grant to John Dean the use of as much
 cleared ground as he inclines to have, so that the
 business respecting the School & land is now clearly
 understood, & put in train to their satisfaction &
 that of the Superintendants; such other matters
 were attended to as we hope will render the situation
 of our friends at Brothertown more comfortable We then proceeded on our way to Stockbridge, but
 were prevented getting there by the state of the
 roads, we therefore bent our course for the Oneidas
 to our friends Absalom & Ruth Hatfield ;
 notice being given we attended the council held
 next morning, in which we encouraged them to
 sobriety & industry, particularly the improvement of
 their lands; we learn that this South Party who go
 under the appellation of Pagans are careful on account
 of the use of Spirituous Liquors & some of them labour
 on the ground & raise corn grain & others of them have
 more or less stock; but generally speaking as far as
 we could discover they are still very improvident; 
their saw mill being damaged, they solcited some aid 
from us to enable them to repair it; we told them 
friends were inclined to assist their Indian Brethren 
when they found they were disposed to labor and 
assist themselves, that if they would turn out strong 
we might be will to lend them some assistance 
they could repay us out of their annuity. As far as we could discern the Indians seem 
to be well satisfied with our friends Absalom & 
Ruth ; they have left the rpemises they first 
occupied & are which was situated near the Council 
Chamber & now are in possesio of the house 
formerly in the occupancy of Jacob Taylor near 
the Turnpike.We herewith annex an acct. 
of the articles furnished Absalom for his own & 
and the use of the Indians, which also includes the 
85 25/100 pd to get possession of the house; 
the whole amount being 449 55/100 Dollars. As it is uncertain what accomodation the 
Indians will provide for a Teacher & Absalom 
& Ruth are disposed to let him have a part of 
their house provided friends are willing to have 
some improvements made, which on consideration 
we hope will leave us justified in authorizing 
Absalom to have done; the two families residing 
together may be better on several accounts, for the 
present at least. It appearing to us expedient 
that Absalom should be furnished with a waggon 
& another horse, we encouraged hime to procure them. At Oneida we met with two Onondgoes 
one of whom had been in New York in company 
with several more of the same nation & had had 
an interview with divers friends there; they 
appeared very solicitous that we should make their 
nation a visit & on consideration we concluded to 
proceed accordingly. On reaching this settlement 
which is about 33 miles fomr Oneida, we had an 
opportunity with them, all of us siting on the 
grass, which was tought more convenient than 
meeting in the house. The Interpreter is a white 
 
man who has resided in the neighbourhood of the 
Indians for many years & at present lives in
 their settlement, he having liberty to cultivate
 land for himself & his family; the Natives appear
 better cloathed than the Oneidas, they received us
 very courteously & we had a satisfactory time
 with them which was greatly increased when we
 were informed not only by themselves but the
 Interpreter, that they had totally refrained
 from the use of ardent spirits for abt. nine
 years & that none of the natives will touch
 it; they spoke of the Divers Great Spirit & of
 its divers influence with as much perspicuity
 as perhaps could be conveyed in any language
 their number consists of One hundred & sixty, men, women
 & children; they possess about twelve thousand acres of
 land & after they were recommended to labor more
 on the ground, they signified they were willing so to
 do, but never having been much taught & not having
 the necessary implements to work with, they have
 not been able to make any great advance therein;
 they informed us that they had received some 
encouragement from friends of Philadelphia of being 
 furnished with the means of cultivating their lands, & 
when they found the Oneidas were assisted they expected
 we would extend our kindness towards them What is worthy of remark as relates to the Onondagas
 is, that they were formerly as noted for their savage
 manners & great intemperance as they are now for
 their gentleness & sobriety of conduct; the Interpreter
 informed us, they had been universally, men & women
 given up to the excessive use of strong drink, so that
 all prospect of civilizing them appeared to be impractica
ble: this great change affords rational grounds
 for encouragement, that the endeavors of friends to
 promote the welfare of this people may be attended
 with success As way did not open to pay a visit to the
 Stockbridge Tribe & having met with several of their
 women on the road, it was concluded that it might
 afford relief to th minds of our two women friends
 for them to send an address to their females, one
 was accordingly prepared & sent
 Onondago 7 mo 29 1809
signd Jn. Murray Ju Catharine Murray 
 Jemima Bunken The report engaged the attention of Friends, especially
 that part which relates to Onondaga Tribe & as it
 is expected that another visit will be made to the Western
 Tribes under our notice in the course of this fall or
 the ensuing winter they are requested to afford
 the Onondagoes such assistance in furnishing
 implements of husbandry &c. as they may judge
 suitable to make careful inspection into their
 situation, in order that this Committee may be
 prepared to take such steps for their benefit, as
 may appear advisable; and John Barrow ,
 Thomas Willis , Gideon Seaman , Esther Griffin 
 & Anne Willis are added to the Committee Adjourned to halfpast seven tomorrow
 morning. About the time adjourned to Friends

 of subjects relative to this concern Gideon Seaman , James Mott , John Murray 
 John Barrow & Saml. Parsons are appointed to 
have an interview with the Governor of this State
 in order to lay before him the disinterested motives by
 which Friends have been led to extend their notice

and the information verbally given by them to this
 Committee was agreeable and encouraging; they

 to propose to the Committee, that in consideration of
 Absalom and Ruth Hatfield's having been under the
 necessity of affording very considerable relief to the
 Indians in their sufferings for want during the
 late scarcity of grain produced by the general failure of
 their crops, the sum of One hundred Dollars be
 allowed them in addition to their salary, which in
 the peculiar circumstances of the cases is approved of,
 and the Treasurer, is directed to pay to Ruth Hatfield 
 the balance of the said Account being $280 1/100
 which includes their salary of Two hundred & fifty
 Dollars, and their expences in removing to Oneida The Committee thinking it some proper that 
some limits should be fixed to the assistance to be extended
 by him to that Indians in the present season of
 suffering from scarcity, conclude that Absalom may
 expend the sum of Fifty Dollars for that purpose
 during the present year; and he is farther authorized
 to procure for them as much seed Corn, Potatoes &c. 
as he may judge necessary; and endeavor to have it
 returned by them when opportunity shall present,
 but on his failure therein he is to be reimbursed by
 the Committee. At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian Concern, held in New York26th of 5 mo 1810 Present 23 Members The Committee to place out at interest the

 the visit; they are continued. The Committee to visit the Indians in the 
Western parts of the State report that no visit
 has been made them since our last Meeting The Committee to furnish supplies to Absalom 
Hatfield, report that further attention has been

 Yearly Meeting, produced an essay which with some
 alterations was approved; the Clerk is directed to
 transcribe it; and Samuel Parsons and Anne
 Murritt are appointed to sign it on behalf of
 the Committee & hand it to the Yearly Meeting
 It is as follows The Committee on the concern relative to
 the Indian report -- that a visit has been
 made in the course of the last Year by some
 of their number to the Brothertown andOneida
 Tribes, as also to a small Tribe at Onandaga The Brothertown Tribe consisting of about
 three hundred individuals appear to live more
 comfortably than in time past, the effects of
 industry and security being manifest amongst them
 to which we believe the labors of the friends who reside
 there have greatly contributed. The School is continud
 as heretofore. That part of the Oneida Tribe with which our
 friends Absalom & Ruth Hatfield reside, are desirous
 of the continuation of our care towards them, appearing
 sensible of their want of instruction. They generally
 refrain from the use of Spirituous Liquors, and some
 have applied themselves to labor for the purpose
 of raising, grain, stock & to promote which we
 have promoted for their use, horses, oxen, & imple
ments of husbandry to a considerable amount;
 we have also found ourselves under the necessity of
 expending additional sums during the winter past,
 and at the present time for the purpose of
 mitigating the extreme sufferings of these poor
 creatures for the want of bread occasioned by the
 general failure of their crops. A permanent
 Teacher for this Tribe has not yet been procured
 which still remains to be a desirable object with the
 Committee. At present our friend Charles
 Willetts of Long Island is acceptably there for the
 purpose of instructing their children in school
 learning, and promoting the views of Friends by
 assisting in leading them into agricultural pursuits. By report of the Friends who visited the
 small settlement at Onondaga, we learn that that
 tribe though in a rude uncultivated state, unaccustomed
 to the arts of husbandry have totally refrained from
 the use of ardent Spirits for a number of years;
 they appeared to receive the visit gratefully and to
 be very desirous of the further care & assistance of
 Friends Before closing this report it may be satisfactory
 to add, that there have been two girls sent from 
Brothertown to be educated amongst Friends under
 the care of the Committee. Signed &c. It appearing very desirable to the Committee
 that a Teacher should be procured to reside amongst
 the Oneidas, Joseph Talcott , John Barrow , Saml.
 Titus, John Murray and Thomas Willis are
 appointed to give careful attention thereto. Adjourned to 6th day evening at 7'o'clock at
 this house. The 1st of the 6th mo the Committee again met
 Present the members generally & several 
friends from the neighbouring Yearly Meetings The Committee to have an interview with the
 Governor of the State report, that one their
 number with one of the General Committee have
 had a satisfactory conference with him agreeably to
 their appointment, in which they laid before and
 explained to him the views of friends in their
 movements for the amelioration of the situation of the the Indians
 within this State, with which the Governor
 appeared to be satisfied, and disposed to
 promote the benevolent designs of Friends The Treasurer is desired to continue to pay
 to John Dean the annual compensation of
 Fifty Pounds till otherwise directed by this
 Committee. The Committee being at this time impressed
 with solicitude for the welfare of the Indian
 Natives was engaged in the consideration of
 selecting some of its number to make a visit
 to the Brothertown, Stockbridge, Oneida and 
Onondaga Tribes, with the view of promoting their
 general improvement and advancement in the arts
 of civilized life, which resulted in appointing to this
 service the following friends, namely 
Thomas Rotch 
Richd. Mott 
Abrm. J Underhill 
Nicholas Wanzer 
Saml. Parsons 
Joseph Talcott 
Thomas Willis

Esther Griffin Adjourned to the 10th of 12th Month the
 evening preceding the Meeting for Sufferings
 at 6'o'clock in the evening, at Pearl Street
 Meeting House, New York The statement of Absalom Hatfield's acct. is entered
 at the Back of the Book At a Meeting of the Committee on the concern relative
 to the Indian Natives, held in New York 10th of 12 mo 1810 Present 22 members The Friends appointed to visit the Indians on the
 Eastern part of Long Island, made the following report, Four of the Committee have visited the Indians on
 the Eastern parts of Long Island, and found them we
 apprehend nearly in the situation as when the Committee
 visited them in 10th Mo 1808 Those on Montauk have plenty of good land to improve, &
 other priviledges, so that with industry & economy they
 might subsist very comfortably. The Shinicock Tribe
 near the Canoe Place not so well circumstanced, their
 land being not so good & more under restrictions from
 the white people. At Montauk they have a pretty
 good school house, & sometimes have a School therein;
 they also occupy it for a Meeting place. At the
 Canoe place they have a Meeting House now in 
tolerable repair & hold Meetings; they are professors with
 the Presbyterians. We also visited a few families
 farther westward; they are settled on a small tract of
 land called Poas-paddock, near Col. Floyd's ; they
 occupy the land for tillage, but we did not find they
 had any right to pasture or get fire wood upon it. They are generally wanting in industry and economy,
 and many of them too much addicted to strong drink, yet
 we were in hopes there was a little improvement amongst
 them. At each place they appeared glad of our
 visit & expressed gratitude for the attention of Friends
 towards them. and upon the whole we had a good
 degree of satisfaction in performing the service.
 Signed on behalf of the Committee
 Gideon Seaman 
 Elizabeth Bowne The care & attention of the Committee in performing
 the visit was satisfactory & as they informed that they
 had distributed some articles amongst the Indians,
 but were not prepared with the account, they were
 directed to produce it at our next Meeting;
 the further consideration of the situation of these
 Tribes was referred to our next Meeting The Committee to make a visit to the Western tribes
 were not prepared to report the performance of the
 service confided to them; but information being given
 that one of said Committee & one of the General
 Committee had been with the Oneidas & inspected into
 the state of things amongst them, the attention of the
 Committee was turned to the consideration thereof, and
 it appearing much to our satisfacion that considerable
 advancement had been made by the Indians during
 the last year in the cultivation of their lands & that
 they had a prospect of good crops; & in order to
 encourage and assist them therein it was concluded
 that an additional number of Oxen, as well as
 implements of husbandry, such as ploughs, chains &c. 
should be procured & placed in the hands of Absalom 
 Hatfield for the use of the Indians, the Committee
 entrusted with the care of assisting Absalom were
 authorized to procure such a number as they should
 think requisite. And as it appeared by inform
ation from the friends above mentioned, that
 considerable uneasiness exists amongst the Oneidas
 of the South Settlement relative to a gore of land
 running far into their settlement, which in the
 division of the reservation had become the property
 of Indians of the other part, and by them sold
 as they understand to the State, from an apprehension
 that the land may be sold to & settled by white
 people to their great injury; in that they solicited
 the care of Friends for their relief; the subject
 was referred to Richard Mott , Willet Hicks , Matthew
 Franklin, Samuel Parsons , John Murray & John
 Barrow; who are desired to give attention thereto. The Committee to visit the Western Tribes are continued
 to the service, with Matthew Franklin , Shadrach
 Ricketson & Anne Mott added & Ann Shipley 
 added No report from the Committee appointed to procure
 a Teacher to reside amongst the Oneidas, they are
 continued. The Treasurer is directed to pay to Samuel
 Mott, the sum of Eleven Dollars, handed out by
 him to enable two Indians of the Stockbridge Tribe to return home. Adjourned to 6'o'clock in the evening

 had listened to the voice of the Great Spirit in leaving off strong drink; we hope you will continue in
 this good resolution daily seeking to the great Spirit
 to strengthen you in it. Brothers
 We are glad you have got your eyes
 open to see what is good for you, and that is is right
 and honorable to cultivate the earth, so that you
 and your families may live comfortably. Sisters
 We want you to help forward this good
 work, not only by encouraging the men to be sober
 and industrious, but by being so yourselves, doing
 your part of the business by learning to spin, weave,
 make clothing for yourselves and families, and
 keeping your houses and all around you neat
 and clean. Brothers and Sisters-
 we wish you would be
 careful to bring up your Children well, teach them to
 hearken to what the Good Spirit says in their
 hearts, to love one another, to be industrious, the
 sons to help their fathers plow, hoe and raise grain,
 and the daughters to assist their mothers in things about
 the house such as spinning, weaving, sewing & keeping
 all clean & in good order, so that when old age comes
 upon the Fathers and Mothers, the Children by
 their industry and good conduct may make them
 comfortable by their firesides. As we want to encourage
 you in your good resolutions, we have desired
 our friends Abraham Lapham, Joseph Frost 
 & Charles Willetts to go & see you & they will assist
 you by binding lending you some farming tools &c., of
 which we desire you will take good care We are your friends

&c. And the Committee having concluded to furnish
 them with one or two pair of Oxen, some spinning
 wheels, farming utensils & seed, Joseph Frost , 
 Charles Willetts, Abraham Lapham & Abraham J
 Underhill are appointed to procure them, deliver them
 on loan to such person or persons in that tribe
 as they may think suitable & call on the Treasurer
 for the amount. The Committee to prepare an Essay of a 
 report to the Yearly Meeting, produced it, which with
 some alterations was approved, directed to be
 transcribed, signed by the Clerk on behalf of the
 Committee & laid before the Yearly Meeting viz To the Yearly Meeting The Committee on the concern relative to the
 Indian Natives having had divers Meetings on
 that interesting subject in the course of the last year,
 and adopted such measures for promoting their
 welfare as way opened for, may state to the
 Yearly Meeting, that as usual an appointment
 was made to pay a visit to such of the Tribes as are
 more immediately under the care of the Committee
 consisting of the Brothertown, Stockbridge, Oneidas, 
& Onondagoes, from their report and other information
 we have derived some agreeable and encouraging
 accounts respecting the progress of part of those Tribes,
 both with respect to their labor on the land, and
 increased care to guard against the intemperate
 use of Spirituous Liquors. Our friend Abraham
 Hatfield continues at Oneida, in speaking of that
 Tribe he observes that there is great encouragement
 respecting this nation as to Agriculture, the most
 of them appeared to be industrious & willing to
 take Friends' advice, that he thought they had
 bread plenty for their families use, and that in
 respect to the use of ardent Spirits there appeared
 to be an improvement The information received
 from the Onondagoes has been so favorable as to
 induce the Committee to believe they ought to be
 encouraged by affording them assistance in the
 cultivation of the earth, and otherwise promote
 their welfare, especially in endeavoring to strengthen them in the good resolutions they had formed
 some years since of abstaining from strong liquors;
 and with this view the Committee have concluded
 to furnish them with some Oxen & farming utensils. Signed &c. The Committee being informed that Thomas
 McCall has returned from Oneida & does not
 expect to return, Joseph Field and Abraham
 J Underhill are appointed to settle with him, call
 on the Treasurer for the amount & report to the
 next sitting of the Committee. Thomas Willis, Isaac Thorn Ju & Abrm
 J Underhill are appointed to make enquiry for
 a suitable man to reside amongst the Oneidas in
 addition to the friends already there to cultivate
 the land and assist & instruct the Indians
 therein. Adjourned to half past 7 o'clock tomorrow
 evening About the time adjourned to, the Committee
 again met. The friends appointed to settle with Thomas
 McCall report it performed, the sum of $26 38/100
 paid him & received from the Treasurer. The friends appointed to procure a person
 to reside amongst the Oneidas, report, that they
 have not succeeded therein, they are continued. The Treasurer is authorized to call in
 such sums of money out on interest as may
 be necessary to pay the orders of the Committee
 upon him. The attention of the Committee was turned to
 consider of the propriety of making an appointment
 to visit the Western tribes under their notice, with
 a view of encouraging and assisting them in
 agriculture & the useful and civilized life and
 attending to such subjects as may in general
 be promotive of their welfare; and to this service
 the following friends are appointed, John Murray 
 Robert Bowne , Thomas Eddy, Gideon Seaman, 
 Thomas Willis, Isaac Thorne Ju, Catharine
 Murray, Esther Lapham, Esther Griffin, Anna
 Thorn, Margaret Richardson & Anne Willis Adjourned to 6'o'clock in the evening preceding
 the Meeting for Sufferings in the 10 mo At a Meeting of the Committee the 7th of the 
 10th Mo 1811 Only 7 of the Committee being 
present, it was concluded to adjourn to 6'oclock in
 the evening preceding the Meeting for Suffering
 in 12th Month next at this house At a Meeting of the Committee on the concern
 relative to the Indians, held the 9th of 12 mo 1811
 Present 23 members The Committee to furnish a statement of
 Absalom Hatfield' account produced it, which on
 consideration was referred to Jn Murray, Samuel
 Parsons, Thomas Eddy and John Barrow for
 further examination, and they are authorized to
 call on the Treasurer for the amount that may
 appear to be due. The Committee to attend to the subject relative
 to a gore of land in the South settlement of the Oneidas
 latterly sold by the Christian partly to the State, 
and likely to be sold out and settled in a manner
 which may prove very injurious to the welfare of
 the Pagan Party, report that they have had an
 interview with the Governor on the subject, and
 that he gave them encouragement that he would
 introduce to the consideration of the Legislature, a
 proposition of making an exchange thereof, agreeably
 to the desire of the Indians; the Committee is
 continued with Tho Eddy added to give further
 attention to the subject. The Committee to furnish the Onondagoes with
 Oxen, farming utensils &c. report attention thereto,
 but not being prepared with the particulars are continued The Committee to engage a suitable Farmer
 to reside amongst the Oneidas, report that they
 have made enquiries, but without effect, they are
 continued The Committee to visit the Western Tribes made
 the following report viz In the course of the Tenth month several
 numbers of the Committee visited the Brothertown
 Stockbridge and Oneida & Onondaga Tribes, and
 have the following particular to state At Brothertown we had an opportunity with a
 number of the most sober part to some satisfaction,
 but viewing them as a Tribe they appear to have
 rather declined, and as considerable has been done
 for them to little effect, we apprehend it might be
 best for Friends to withold all pecuniary aid from
 them for a season, as they have the mean of
 living quite comfortably, if they will only make
 good use of them. At Stockbridge they do not appear to have
 improved much of late, many of them being not
 only idle and neglectful of business, but given to 
drinking and excess, yet they have some sober
 persons of both sexes still among them, who recieved
 us very cordially Things wear a different appearance at
 Oneida; in walking about their settlements we were
 pleased to see their improvements in agriculture;
 they appeared to have plenty of grain for their own
 use, many new Cribs full of corn, and have
 sowed considerable wheat and put it in good
 fence. We had two conferences with them in which
 the Chief objects they had in view seemed the
 establishment of a School to be taught by a member
 of our Society, and Absalom & Ruth Hatfield 
 offering to begin a School this winter, and to
 teach some of the Women to spin, sow & knit,
 we encouraged them & ordered some spinning
 wheels & flax purchased for their use, that it 
might be going on till way opens for some one else
 to undertake it, or if they should prove qualified for
 the undertaking, we have thought it might answer
 to employ some other friends to attend to the farming
 and general concerns, Absalom's health being so
 much impaired there is no probability of his being
 able to answer the purpose another year; and if
 a farmer is continued amongst them, it will be
 necessary to provide one to take his place in the
 Spring; and to be of much use to them in that line,
 he ought besides other qualifications to be a thorough
 smartman. The Onondaga Tribe appear to be an industrious
 sober people, having but little intercourse with the
 white people around them, placing no confidence in
 any but Friends. We think the way is quite open
 and an encouraging prospect of Friends being useful
 to them provided a suitable family could be got to
 settle near them a convenient place for the 
purpose, joining their lands on the north side,
 containing 200 acres, under some improvement
 is now offered for sale, and is thought may be had
 low, perhaps 9 or 10 Dolls per arce we found
 them engaged generally in gathering their corn; they
 appeared to have plenty for their own consumption
 and some to spare for other necessaries. They are
 getting in the way of raising wheat, potatoes and
 pumpkins, and are desirous of further instruction
 and assistance The two pair of Oxen Friends
 provided them with, as well as those at Oneida,
 we left in charge with Joseph Frost to sell them if
 he can, if he cannot to advantage, to endeavor to
 get good places for them to be kept for their
 services, or at as low a rate as may answer (Signed) Isaac Thorn Ju 
 Anna M Thorn 
 A J Underhill Adjourned tomorrow afternoon at 3'o'clock 10th of 12 mo the Committee met Information was communicated to the Committee
 that several women of the Stockbridge Tribe were
 desirous of opening a Spinning School under the
 care of Mary Doxtady late Peters, and wanted
 some wheels and flax for that purpose; on consideration 
it was concluded to furnish them on
 loan with four small wheels and one large wheel
 some wool cards, some wool, flax and flaxseed, to the
 amount altogether of 30 to 40 Dolls; the Clerk is
 directed to furnish a copy of this minute to Joseph
 Frost, and request him to procure the above on
 behalf of the Committee, and draw on the Treasurer
 for the amount. It being stated in the report of the Committee
 who lately visited the Indians that a tract of land 
containing about two hundred acres with some
 improvement was offered for sale, adjourning the
 Onondaga settlement, which they judged it would be
 proper for friends to purchase in order to place on
 it a suitable person to attend to the instruction of
 the Indians; the Clerk is directed to write to Joseph
 Frost, to obtain the necessary description of the
 land, and information at what price it can likely
 be had for cash, as may enable the Committee
 to decide on the subject Adjournment to 6'o'clock in the evening preceeding
 the Meeting for Sufferings in 4th month. At a Special Meeting of the Committee on
 the Indian Concern, held 3 of 1 mo 1812
 Present 10 Members A representation was made to the Committee 
on behalf of the Shinecock Tribe resident on the
 Eastern part of Long Island stating certain
 grievances and incroachments on their priviledges
 by the Inhabitants of the Town of Southampton
 and requesting the assistance of Friends in
 promoting their relief by forwarding a memorial
 from them to the Legislature and assisting them
 in promoting obtaining its objective; the subject is referred to
 John Murray, Tho Eddy, Robt Bowne, and
 Samuel Parsons to give such attention to it as they may judge needful Information was communicated to the Committee
 by the medium of a teller from a Committee of the
 Meeting for Sufferings in Philadelphia, that by the
 desire of Friends in England, they were engaged
 in preparing a statement of their proceedings in
 relation to the civilization of the Indians, and
 requested a narrative of what had been done in
 this Yearly Meeting on the subject; John Murray, 
 Samuel Parsons, Shadrach Ricketson & Samuel
 Mott, are appointed to prepare an essay of a
 statement & lay it before the Committee At a Special Meeting of the Committee on the
 Indian Concern held in New York 3 of 3 mo 1812 Present 10 members The Friends appointed to give attention to the
 Shinecock Tribe of Indians, report that they have
 made them a visit, and examined the nature of
 their contract with the Town of Southampton; and
 that the Trustees of said Town had since given
 them notice in writing, that they will meet the
 Indians, and those friends whom this Committee
 may appoint on the 17th of this month, in order
 to accommodate their differences with said 
Tribe; the following Friends are appointed to
 meet them, and render the Indians such assistance
 as may appear necessary, namely, Thomas Willis,
 Gideon Seaman & Matthew Franklin . At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian
 Concern held in New York 13 of 4 mo 1812
 Present 14 members, and reasons offered for

 Treasurer for the amount due on Absalom Hatfield 
 account, not being prepared to report are continued The friends appointed to give attention to the
 circumstance relative to a gore of land in the
 south settlement of the Oneida Tribe report
 attention, but owing to sundry disappointments 
have not been able to effect the desired end; and they
 now informing that said land is not likely to be
 sold till some time hence, they are desired to give
 such further attention thereto as the nation of
 the case may require The Committee to furnish the Onondago Tribe
 with Oxen, farming utensils & report attention;
 but owing to the miscarriage of letters they have
 been unable to obtain an account of the particular
 expenditures they are continued The Committee to engage a Friend as a
 Farmer to reside amongst the Oneida Tribe
 report attention, and that they have not had
 opportunity to engage one as a permanent
 resident, but that they have agreed with Charles
 Willetts who offers to devote some time amongst
 the Oneida and Onondaga Tribes alternately
 and to give his attention to instructing them 
in the cultivation of their lands The Committee
 are continued to give such further attention to the
 subject as may appear to be requisite with James
 Mott added It appears by information now received in a
 letter from Joseph Frost to a member of this
 Committee, that the School opened at Oneida
 under the care of Absalom & Ruth Hatfield, for
 the instruction of youth in literature as also
 their women in knitting, spinning & affords
 an encouraging prospect, that divers of them are
 making considerable progress in those arts, and
 the Committee being deirous to give them further
 aid, it is concluded that they be furnished with
 one weavers loom, some spinning wheels & cards
 on loan also some wool and flax for their
 use: Joseph Frost is therefore appointed in
 conjunction with Absalom & Ruth Hatfield to
 procure such of those articles for the use of the 
Indians as may appear proper & draw on
 the Treasurer for the amount expended, not
 exceeding the sum of One hundred Dollars
 The Clerk is directed to furnish him with a
 copy of this minute No report respecting furnishing the
 Stockbridge Tribe with spinning wheels, wool
 flax &c. and it appearing by information
 now received from Joseph Frost that he had
 not received the communication of the Clerk
 on that subject, the present Clerk is directed
 to transmit a copy of this Meeting's former
 Minute to Joseph Frost, as also respecting
 that relative to the Farm at Onondaga as
 no report is received respecting that for the
 same reasons; and Cha. Willetts is requested
 to unite with Joseph Frost in attending to
 the foregoing subjects The Committee to draft a narrative of 
the proceedings of this Committee to be sent to
 Friends of London England are continued The Committee to give attention to the situation 
of the lands of the Shinecock Tribe on Long
 Island report attention, and that an Essay has
 been made for a settlement between the Indians
 and white Inhabitants, but finding the laws
 relative to Indians prohibited making the division
 of their lands as proposed, the matter is suspended
 for the present The same Committee are
 desired to keep the subject under their care & 
report when they judge it needful Thomas Eddy, Matthew Franklin, 
 Abrm J Underhill, Anna Thorn & Lydia Mott 
 are appointed to essay a report to our next
 Yearly Meeting, and produce at the adjournment
 of this Committee. Adjourned to the 7th hour on second day
 evening during the Yearly Meeting at Pearl
 Street Meeting House in New York At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian Concern
 held in New York the 25 of 5 mo 1812 The Members generally were present & we had
 the acceptable company of several friends from the
 neighbouring Yearly Meetings The Committee to call on the Treasurer for
 the amount due on Absalom Hatfield's account not being
 prepared to report were continued The Committee to attend to the Gore of land in
 the Oneida South Settlement reported that the
 Indians had prepared to Memorial to the Governor
 on the subject, and a Map thereof having been made
 to be communicated with it, they were desired to have
 it forwarded to the Governor & give such attention
 as may be needful to obtain its object The Committee to furnish the Onondaga
 Tribe with Oxen, farming utensils & produced
 an account thereof amounting to $188 3/100 which
 the Treasurer is desired to pay The Committee to engage a Farmer to reside
 amongst the Oneidas not being prepared to report
 were continued Joseph Frost informed in writing that he had
 given some attention to the subject of procuring some
 spinning wheels & for the Stockbridge Tribe but had
 not compleated the service: no account was received
 from him respecting furnishing the like articles for
 the Spinning School at Oneida; nor relative to the
 information requested from him respecting obtaining
 the Farm at Onondago. The Friends to draft a narrative of the
 proceedings of this Committee to be sent to England
 not being prepared to report are continued. The Committee to essay a report to the Yearly
 Meeting produced it, which with some alteration was
 approved; the Clerk was directed to transcribe & sign
 it on behalf of the Committee & lay it before the
 Yearly Meeting It is as follows To the Yearly Meeting The Committee on the concern relative to the civilization
 and welfare of the Indians report, that in endeavor
ing to carry into effect the design of their appointment
 they have been comforted in a belief, that the situation
 of many of the Indians has been made more
 comfortable by their improvements in agriculture &
 by an increased care among them in avoiding the
 intemperate use of Spirituous Liquors At Oneida
 a number have made considerable advancement in
 farming. They generally had plenty of corn for
 their own use, and considerable wheat in the ground
 inclosed with good fence; a school has been kept
 up during the last six months by Absalom &
 Ruth Hatfield ; about thirty scholars attended, and
 many of them made tolerable good progress in learning:
 the Indians having expressed a desire to be taught
 spinning, knitting & weaving, the Committee directed 
wheels, flax & a loom to be purchased, and several
 of their young women have already made considerable
 progress in learning to spin and knit; they appear
 much pleased with this additional care of Friends To instruct them in these branches, the Committee
 conceive to be very important, as it is reasonable to
 believe, that as the women advance in this kind of
 industry, and contribute so much to the comfort
 of their families, their influence with the men will
 be increased, their condition ameliorated, and they
 relieved from out door work; and that the men
 will be encouraged to attend more readily to agricultural
 pursuits The Committee have been desirous of
 engaging a suitable friend to reside at Oneida in
 addition to the friends who are now there in order
 to instruct the Indians in agriculture, but have
 not as yet been able to procure one. Several of
 the Tribes have been visited by Committees appointed
 for that purpose at Stockbridge they do not appear 
to have improved much, tho' there are a few of both
 sexes, who seem desirous of getting into more sober &
 industrious habits The Onondaga Tribe formerly
 thought to be the most uncivilized of the six nations
 now support the Character of a sober and industrious
 people; it is believed they have entirely quit the use of
 Spirituous Liquors; they raise more corn than is
 sufficient for their own consumption, and are
 getting in the way of raising wheat & : Friends
 being disposed to encourage them therein, the Committee
 supplied them with two pair of Oxen, some farming
 utensils & propose extending further care & occasional
 assistance. Being applied to by the Shinecock
 Tribe, residing at the east end of Long Island, to
 assist them in adjusting some difference that subsisted
 relative to their concerns, they have been visited &
 such advice & assistance have been afforded as seemed
 necessary Signed by direction & on behalf
 Of the Committee 5 mo 25 1812 Adjourned to 7'o'clock on fourth day evening 27th of the month The Committee met pursuant
 to adjournment The attention of the Committee was turned to
 consider of the propriety of making an appointment
 to visit the Tribes in the western parts of the State
 under our care with a view of promoting their
 civilization and advancement in the useful arts of
 civilized life, and to this service the following friends
 were appointed, namely James Mott , Abrm J Underhill, 
 Charles Willetts, Isaac Thorn Ju. Lydia Mott, Ann
 Shipley Phebe Field & Anne Thorne ; and they
 were requested to give attention that the articles for
 the improvement of the Stockbridge & Oneida Tribes
 in spinning, weaving & heretofore committed to
 Joseph Frost, be procured for them & also to render
 similar assistance to the Onondagoes if on visiting
 them it should be judged expedient; and to attend
 to such other subjects interesting to the welfare of the 
Indians as may be found necessary Adjourned to 6'o'clock in the evening preceding
 the Meeting for Sufferings in the Twelfth Month next
 at Pearl Street Meeting House, New York. At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian Concern
 held in New York 7 of 12 mo 1812 Present 16 Members Two of the Committee appointed to visit the Indians
 report that they in company with two of the General Committee
 had made a visit to the Western Tribes under our notice,
 the report is as follows to wit We have performed a visit in company with Gideon
 Seaman & Joseph Frost to the Brothertown, Stockbridge
 Oneida & Onondaga Tribes Some of those of Brothertown are very industrious
 & improving in agriculture, but in general they have
 not made that improvement that might have been 
expected, considering the attention that has been paid them;
 many of them continue in the habit of drinking to excess, whereby
the necessary attention to the improvement of their land is
 neglected The Stockbridge nation we think have made considerable
 advancement in improving their lands and raising grain &
 divers of them have raised some flax this season, encouraged 
thereto by their young women's learning to spin in consequence
 of being furnished by the Committee with wheels, flax, wool
 & On their receiving these a general Council was called
 to consult on the method to be pursued in teaching their
 girls the use of them, and they unitedly agreed that a
 school should be established for the purpose, and that
 one of the Young Women educated in Pennsylvania should
 teach it, and some of their principal women superintend
 the business; and we find it has been conducted with
 regularity & harmony. On our going into the School
 room, we found 38 bunches of yarn hanging in regular
 order, under the names of 38 girls & women who had 
spun it, and most of it was better done, than we had a
 right to expect Their women are much pleased with
 the prospect of their daughter being taught to make them
 clothing, and some of the men seem encouraged to turn
 their attention to raise sheep as well as flax for the
 purpose. But too many here as well as at Brothertown
 give way to excessive drinking, by which means very
 little improvement of the farms of these appears The Oneidas have of latter time made greater
 improvement in agriculture than the Stockbridge nation,
 they raise wheat as well as plenty of Corn, we were
 informed they last year sowed about 100 bushels of wheat,
 but not quite so much this year, they have 15 yoke of
 Oxen of their own & a number of Cows & horses
 And a number of the girls & women have been taught
 by Ruth Hatfield to spin, with which this nation
 also seem much pleased. We find Absalom Hatfield 
 health is such as to render him incapable of 
attending to the most necessary part of the business for
 which he was placed there: this part of the Oneidas
 generally abstain from ardent Spirits The Onondagoes appear to be sober & industrious &
 have improved their lands for the time they have
 turned their attention to it, more than either of the
 other nations & seem very grateful for the aid & encourage
ment Friends have afforded them. We think there is a prospect of much advantage
 resulting from their women in each nation being taught
 & encouraged in making their own cloathing; the women
 thereby will find more employment in the house, while
 the men it is to be hoped will be induced to cultivate
 the land & afford the materials for their cloathing 10 mo 25 1812 James Mott 
 Charles Willets The attention & care of the Committee was satisfactory
 & it being very agreeable to observe the improvement 
of the Stockbridge Women in spinning & the Committee
 are disposed to give them further aid therein, it is
 concluded that Joseph Frost & John Dean be requested
 to procure such quantity of raw materials for that
 purpose as they may judge expedient, including flax
 wool & a number of additional spinning wheels; & also to
 extend similar assistance to the Oneidas & Onondagoes
 if they should deem it proper Adjourned to 6'o'clock tomorrow evening 8th of the Month The Committee met It appearing from the report of the Committee who had
 visited the Indians that Absalom Hatfield's bodily indisposition
 had increased, so as very much to diminish his
 usefulness to the Indians, the Committee on taking
 the subject into consideration, apprehended that the
 design of Absalom & Ruth's being placed at Oneida
 would not likely be answered by their continuing
 there much longer under present circumstances: 
the subject is referred for further attention to our
 next Meeting. The Committee on Absalom Hatfield's account
 report it settled up to 1 of 3 mo 1812 & the balance due
 him amounting to $117 48/100 received from the Treasurer
 & paid him as directed The Committee appointed to Attend to the Gore
 of land in the Oneida South Settlement report
 further attention thereto; they are continued No report from the Committee appointed
 to engage a Farmer to reside amongst the Oneidas,
 they are continued The Committee to draft a narrative of
 the proceedings of this Committee to be sent to
 England, produced an Essay which was read & 
referred for further attention to the Committee
 with Richd Mott , Mattw Franklin & Tho Eddy added. Adjourned to the evening preceeding the Meeting
 for Sufferings in Second Month next at this house At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian Concern
 held in New York 8 of 2 mo 1813 Present 14 members, and a reason was offered
 for the absence of one The subject of Absalom & Ruth Hatfield's 
 being released from an attention to te objects of this
 concern at Oneida being further considered, it was
 concluded to be expedient that such a change should
 take place; and it appearing proper that some
 friends should be selected to communicate this
 information to them, to examine & settle Absalom's 
 accounts & to make such arranements consequent
 on their removal as they may judge expedient,
 James Mott , Thomas Eddy , Jn Murray Ju 
 & Saml Parsons were appointed to attend to the 
service, and authorized to defray the expence of
 Absalom & Ruth's removal. And it appearing by
 information recieved in a letter from Joseph Frost 
 & Jn Dean , that considerable suffering was likely to
 take place amongst the Oneida & Stockbridge Tribes,
 occasioned by the failure of their last crops of grain,
 the Committee last appointed were requested to give
 such attention to the subject as they should judge
 necessary to prevent their suffering: and also to
 extend assistance to the Onondagoes to preserve
 their Cattle from perishing in the present scarcity
 of fodder amongst them The Committee on the Gore of land in the Oneida
 South Settlement reported, that an application to the
 Surveyor General he had suspended the sale of
 said land; and that they had forwarded to the
 Governor a Memorial of the Indians on the
 subject & a map of the land referred to; they were
 continued to the service 
The Committee appointed to engage a Farmer to
 reside amongst the Oneidas were released from the
 service The Committee being informed by John Griffin 
 that two girls of the Brothertown Tribe who had
 been under his care nearly two years & been boarded
 and instructed in School learning & other knowledge
 had latterly returned to their parents, it was concluded
 that it would be reasonable & proper that some
 allowance should be made him therefor & for having
 cloathed them & furnished them with money to hear
 their expences home, and the Treasurer was
 requested to pay him the sum of One hundred
 & thirty Dollars. Willet Hicks , Thomas Eddy & Saml Parson 
 were appointed to prepare an Essay of a Report
 to the Yearly Meeting & produce it at our
 next Meeting Adjourned to 7 o'clock on the first day and 
during the call of the ensuig Yearly Meeting. The Friends to whom was referred the narrative
 of the proceedings of this Committee to be sent to
 England, reported the Essay amended, which being
 read, was approved; and the Clerk was directed
 to transcribe & sign it on behalf of this Committee,
 & forward it to the Clerk of the Meeting for
 Sufferings in London The narrative is as follows Some account of the progress of Friends of the Yearly
 Meeting of New York, in their concern for the welfare
 and civilization of the Indians residency on the frontiers
 of the State. It appears that individual members
 of the Society had occasionally extended advice & assistance
 to the Aborigins of our Country; and that in the year
 1795, the subject of promoting their welfare & civilization
 obtained the attention of the Yearly Meeting, when a
 Committee was appointed to unite with the Meeting
 for Sufferings in the further consideration of the subject;
 which resulted in selecting some of their number to visit
 the Indians in order to obtain such knowledge of their cir
cumstances and situation as might enable them to
 decide on the steps proper to be taken to carry into effect 
the views of the Yearly Meeting; the Committee performed
 the service, and on their return reported as follows; Agreeably to our appointment we have made a 
 visit to most of the Indian Nations on the frontier of this
 State. We first visited those settled at Brothertown, which
 is about one hundred and twenty miles northwest of Albany;
 they consist of about 35 families, being parts of several
 tribes from New London, Narraganset and Long Island, 
and have some knowledge of the English language, habits
 and manners; some of them can read and write, and all progress
 a belief in Christianity. They possess about 10,000 acres of
 very fair land, given them by the Oneida Tribe, which is
 laid out in farms of 50 to 150 acres to a family: a
 number of them appear to be desirous of religious improvement,
 and frequently meet together on the first day of the week
 for the purpose of religious instruction, and employ the time
 in reading and exhortation From Brothertown we proceeded to a
 settlement made by the Stockbridge Tribe, about 15 miles
 further west and within 5 miles of the principal town
 of the Oneidas, who gave them the tract on which they
 are now settled, containing six miles square of excellent
 land; they removed from Massachusetts to this place
 about 10 years since. The Stockbridge Indians are generally
 unacquainted with the English language, and retain
 their native dress and manners; some of them have
 separate farms, but they are very indifferently tilled, as 
many of them are idle and indisposed to the cultivation of
 their land, which must in great measure be attributed to
 their former habits of life in hunting &c. This
 nation consists of about 60 families; they were about
 endeavouring to get a saw mill erected, but not having
 funds to complete it, we furnished them with pecuniary
 aid. We had much satisfaction in a Council with
 the men and women of this tribe, one of them on behalf
 the rest expressed their sorrow that the great evil of drinking
 Spirituous Liquors had so much prevailed amongst his
 nation and Western Brothers, which had blinded many, 
and prevented their following the advice of the Friends
 as they had been used to do; for which he was very sorry, as
 the Six Nations had long experienced the kindness of
 William Penn and his Children, but hoped we would
 not be too much discouraged with them. From Stockbridge we went to the principal
 settlement of the Oneidas; this nation resided where
 they now are when the Country was first known to the
 white people; it now consists of about 150 families, and
 altho' they possess 24 miles square of excellent land,
 they have made but little agricultural improvement
 or advancement in civilized life, being like the
 other Tribes addicted to the excessive use of ardent spirits;
 they are mostly very idle, and the little labour which
 is done is commonly performed by the women. We had a prospect of preceeding from the place to
 visit the Onondagoes, a Tribe resident about 35 miles
 further west; this prospect however we relinquished on
 learning that they were the most uncivilized of any of
 the Six Nations, and lived in habitual intoxication;
 and that they were generally at that time in a state
 of drunkenness, having recently received their annuity from
 the Government, which had induced white Traders to
 carry Spirituous Liquors amongst them; but as there
 were a few sober sensible men in the Tribe, we sent
 an address to Capt John , one of their Cheifs expressive
 of the nature of the Societys concern and our solicitude
 for their welfare. We had often to lament the strong
 attachment of the Indians to Spirituous Liquors
 which is the principal obstacle to their civilization
 and agricultural improvement, and we consider it
 of the utmost importance to prevent by every possible
 means the introduction of this article amongst them.
 And it is our decided opinion that it would tend
 greatly to their advantage could they be prevailed
 on to have farms allotted to each family, in order
 that they may have some idea of separate property,
 which would be likely to produce habits of industry,
 and induce them more generally to till the ground for
 their support. The Yearly Meeting on being possessed 
of the information contained in the preceding statement
 placed the subject under the care of a Special Com
mittee, with instructions to take such steps as should
 appear to them best calculated to carry into effect the concern
 of the Yearly Meeting for ameliorating the condition of this part of the
human family. The objects claiming the attention
 of the Committee have been to impress on the minds of the
 Indians such a knowledge of the Supreme Being and of the
 teachings of his Grace as they appeared to be capable of
 receiving to dissuade them from the use of ardent spirits;
 to encourage habits of industry in the cultivation of their
 lands; to give them a knowledge of some of the most
 useful mechanic arts, and to afford instruction to their 
children in School learning; with these views frequent
 visits have been made them, and working Cattle and
 many implements of husbandry have been from time
 to time furnished them and assistance rendered in
 building grist and saw mills. In order to
 facilitate their agricultural pursuits and general
 improvement, it was deemed proper to place families
 in some of the Tribes, and several families of Friends
 being so much interested in the welfare of the Indians
 as to be willing to reside amongst them, were settled
 accordingly. By the reports of the Friends appointed
 from time to time to visit the different Tribes, it appears,
 that although considerable endeavours have been used 
to promote the improvement of the Stockbridge and
 Brothertown Tribes, and a family of Friends has resided
 several years at the latter place, and applied themselves
 with diligence to the service for which they were selected;
 these Tribes have not improved equally with the others,
 considering their previous progress, the care which has
 been extended to them, and the time that has elapsed
 since it was first exercised; principally owing to the
 vicinity of white inhabitants, and the consequent fa
cility of procuring Spirituous Liquors; they have
 however made considerable progress in agriculture,
 and the Stockbridge Women have latterly taken
 much interest in a Spinnng School established amongst
 them and made rapid progress in that branch of industry
 so useful to them, and so important to their advancement
 in civilized life; and hopes are cherished that be
nificial effects will result to the Indian Youth,
 from the Schools which have been for a long time kept
 up in these Tribes. During the time that our attention was
 principally confined to the Brothertown & Stockbridge
 Tribes, the Friends of the Yearly Meeting of Pennsyl
vania, had given considerable aid to the Oneida Tribe
 and several Friends interested in their welfare had
 resided amongst them for the purpose of promoting their
 agricultural and general improvement, but after 
considerable exertions for their benefit the friends of Penn
sylvania found it expedient to withdraw their care
 and attention; the Oneidas afterwards expressed renewed
 desires for Friends' assistance, and as they were more
 immediately in our neighbourhood, and the Friends
 of Pennsylvania had extended their care to several
 more remote Western Tribes, it appeared proper that we
 should inspect into their situation. The Oneida Tribe
 afterwards formed themselves into two parties and made a 
division of their land; one was called the Christian Party,
 in consequence of their having attached themselves to a
 Missionary who had for a long time resided in the Tribe,
 and the other was called the Pagan Party; and as there
 appeared to be the greatest probability of our being useful
 to the latter, from their being particularly
 desirous of our
 assistance, a family of Friends was placed there whose
 counsel and attention have been very useful to the Indians
 A School for the instruction of their Youth was some time
 since opened and latterly extended to promote the im
provement of their females in spinning; the Oneidas 
have become much interested in the cultivation of their
 land, and their improvements in husbandry, and increas
ingly sober habits have given peculiar satisfaction. The Committee have recently felt much
 interested for the Onondagoe Tribe, who having for
 some years past relinquished the use of ardent spirits, 
and become sober and industrious, requested the assistance
 of Friends; they have accordingly been supplied with
 Oxen and farming utensils, and their agricultural
 improvement and advancement in civilization have been
 the most rapid of any of the Tribes. Experience has proved that it is most bene
ficial to the Indians to be furnished with pecuniary aid
 in such manner as may tend to develop and call into
 exercise their own resources, lest they indulge the disposition
 of depending upon Friends for regular and stated assistance,
 which would eventually prove injurious to them; it has
 therefore been deemed most advisable that the application
 of our funds should be made productive of their agri
cultural improvement by procuring them the necessary
 means to facilitate labour. And it is but justice
 to observe that the liberality of our Brethren in
 England has been sensibly felt, as thereby the Com
mittee has been enabled to extend its views and
 enlarge the sphere of its usefulness to this People. The annexed statistical account will further
 elucidate the present situation of the different Tribes
 under the care of the Committee. We have also
 subjoined an address from the Onondaga Tribe and
 our answer. Signed on behalf of the

 fire once more; we have heard that you wanted to know
 whether the Onondagoes had left off the use of strong
 drink, or not. Brothers, we have left off a long
 time ago- you told us leave off- the Great Spirit told
 us to leave off: we have listened to His voice. There are some that visit us from the Oneidas that
 drink, we think they will leave off by our good advice. Brothers, we are in want of Cattle, chains,
 ploughs, and all kinds of farming utensils; you have told
 us that you would help us; we were glad to hear you
 were willing to help us. Brothers, we are in want of blacksmiths,
 carpenters, and other mechanics; we want to learn our
 children to work; we have opened our eyes, we now
 see that we must work; we are willing to work; we
 begin to raise wheat, and will do more if we can
 get help. Brothers,
 A part of our Tribe lives at 
Buffaloe, they are of the same mind with us, we all agree.
 we wish if you will help us to Oxen and farming
 utensils that you would send them on as soon as you can,
 as we are much in want, you will find us of the same
 mind, as we were when you were here; we hope to hear
 from you soon. Brothers, we respect you, and wish you all
 will, remember us at your great Council. We look to
 you as our friends. Signed by four of our Chiefs

 Friends and Brothers Your letter was read in our Council;
 and our hearts were made glad to find you had
 listened to the voice of the Great Spirit in leaving
 off strong drink; we hope you will continue in this
 good resolution, daily seeking to the Great Spirit
 to strengthen you in it. Brothers,
 We are glad you have got your eyes open
 to see what is good for you, and that it is right and
 honourable to cultivate the earth, so that you and
 your families may live comfortably. Sisters, we want you to help forward this
 good work, not only by encouraging the men to be
 sober and industrious, but by being so yourselves;
 doing your part of the business by learning to spin,
 weave and make clothing for yourselves and families,
 and keeping your houses and all around you neat
 and clean. Brothers & Sisters
 We wish you would be careful to
 bring up your children well; teach them to hearken
 to what the Good Spirit says in their hearts, to
 love one another, to be industrious; the sons to
 help their fathers plough, hoe and raise grain,
 and the daughters to assist their mothers in things
 about the house, such as spinning, weaving,
 sewing and keeping all clean and in order;
 so that when old age comes upon the Fathers and
 Mothers, the children by their industry and good
 conduct may make them comfortable by their
 firesides. As we want to incourage you in your good resolution
 we have desired our friend to go and see you and
 they will assist you by lending you such Oxen and
 farming utensils as you stand in need of, of which
 we desire you will take good care. We are your Friends

 Susanna Horne of Great Britain, & of a
 number of Friends of a neighbouring Yearly
 Meeting The Committee appointed to attend
 to the subject of Absalom & Ruth Hatfield's 
 removal, reported that owing to the state of
 his health, they were still unable to remove;
 & that the Committee had given attention to the
 other subjects entrusted to them. A statement of Joseph Frost's accts was
 presented & referred for examination to
 Thos. Eddy & Joseph Byrd , who were authorizd.
 to receive the balance due him from the
 Treasurer & forward it to him It appearing by a letter from Joseph
 Frost, that grain for seed & two yoke of
 Oxen were wanted for the Indians; Joseph
 Frost was desired to procure one pair for
 the Oneidas & one pair for the Onondagoes,
 & such implements of husbandry & grain for
 seed as he may judge expedient. The Committee to give attention to the 
Gore of the land in the Oneida South Settlement, reportd.
 that they had attended to the subject & that the
 Legislature had enacted a law prohibiting the
 sale of the land referred to. Josiah Field and Willet Hicks were
 appointed to examine the Treasurer's Accounts
 & report a statement thereof to our next Meeting It appearing probable that in consequence
 of the indisposition of Absalom Hatfield 
 considerable attention would be requisite to the
 concerns of the Indians; and that there would
 be a necessity of obtaining the assistance of
 some Friends in their vicinity who are not
 of the Committee, the Clerk was directed to unite
 to Peleg Gifford , Abrm Bradbury & Ackus
 Ruthbone on behalf of this Committee & request
 them to afford Joseph Frost such aid as
 may appear to be needful. The attention of the Committee was engaged in
 the consideration of the propriety of making an
 appointment to visit the Tribes in the Western
 parts of the State under our care, with a view
 of promoting their civilization & general 
improvement, and to this service the following
 friends were appointed, to wit Adam Mott 
 Josiah Field, James Mott, Jn Griffin, 
 Samuel Parsons, Thos Willis, Charles Willetts, 
 Esther Griffin, Phebe Field, Anne Willis, 
 Elizabeth Byrd & Anne Mott . The Friends appointed to prepare an
 Essay of a report to the Yearly Meeting produced
 it, which was approved, directed to be signed
 by the Clerk & laid before the Yearly Meeting It is as follows To the Yearly Meeting The Committee on the Concern for the
 civilization & welfare of the Indians
 Having given attention to the object of the 
concern; the Tribes under our care have been
 visited by some of our number, and such attention
 and assistance afforded them as appeared to be
 necessary. Having in former reports stated the
 particular circumstances of the different Tribes, we do
 not at this time judge it necessary to repeat the same,
 except that in addition to our encouraging them in
 the cultivation of their land, we have suggested to
 them the advantages that would probably result from
 their women's learning to spin and weave to provide
 themselves with cloathing. In order to encourage
 them in this very useful undertaking, we have
 furnished some of the Tribes with flax & wool & 
a number of wheels to make a beginning which
 has succeeded beyond our expectation, and been a
 means of inducing some of them to raise these
 articles for themselves Friends in England being desirous of obtaining
 information respecting the rise and progress of
 this concern; and the Meeting for Sufferings in
 London having requested to be furnished with 
some account of our proceedings; we have lately
 communicated to them a detailed statement of the
 situation of those Tribes who have claimed our
 attention. Signed by direction & on behalf

 Joseph Frost's accounts reportd that they have
 not performed the service; they are continued The Committee appointed to examine the
 Treasurer's accounts reported that they were
 accurately kept, and produced a statement thereof
 by which there appeared to be a balance of 
nine hundred, twenty five 20/100 Dollars in his hands,
 also Peter G Stuyvesant's Bond for $4000, &
 Joseph Rouke's note for $125. The Committee appointed to visit the
 Indians made the following report We of the Committee appointed to visit the several
 tribes of Indians to whom the care of Friends has
 been extended now report That we first visited the Brothertown Tribe
 had a satisfactory opportunity with them collectively
 and also called at a number of their families, and
 on inspecting their situation it appears, that in
 consequences of the attention of John & Thomas Dean ,
 we apprehend no assistance at present necessary;
 but as they have a prospect of removing from
 thence we think the care of the Committee will still
 be requisite Having inspected the situation of the Tribe
 at New Stockbridge, we have not discovered much 
improvement in agriculture, many of the men being
 given to intemperance & indolence, which evil we
 believe has been greatly increased by the introduction
 of white people living among them: they have also been
 induced to let out their Farms to these people on
 conditions unprofitable to themselves, thereby depending
 on their labor; but as arrangements are made by
 Government for removing the white inhabitants, we
 encouraged them to improve the land by their own
 labor, and had the satisfaction to Observe that
 a number manifested a disposition to adhere thereto The introduction of a spinning School amongst them
 appears to have stimulated a number of their women
 to progress in that art; some of them having
 proceeded to make cloth for their own use; and
 we thought it right to furnish them with more
 wool, flax and some wheels, that the school may
 be continued to advantage Some of the men have
 been induced to commence raising flax; that the
 continuance of this business affords a prospect of
 usefuness to that people, and we believe if persevered 
in, will gradually promote habits of industry
 more generally amongst them The South settlement of the Oneida Tribe
 appears to be gradually improving in the arts
 of agriculture, tho' here as in other Tribes there
 remains much room for advancement; some
 of them we are informed have refrained from the
 use of ardent Spirits for a number of years, others
 have remained more or less intemperate; but
 owing to the coincidence of several affecting
 circumstances, they had lately convened in Council
 and as we were informed, unitedly agreed to
 refrain enirely in future from the use of
 Ardent Spirits; we pressingly enjoined them
 to maintain this resolution, which they solemnly
 promised faithfully observe. We encouraged
 their women to continue the arts of spinning,
 knitting & and they uniting therewith, we
 thought some further aid in furnishing some
 Wool, flax and some wheels would be necessary; 
one of their own Tribe appears willing to take
 charge of a School for instructing others in these
 arts; and we directed some materials to be
 procured accordingly The oxen & farming
 utensils heretofore furnished to this Tribe appear
 to have been useful, and for which they expressed
 their gratitude: on enquiry we understood they were
 still in good repair, and likely to last the present
 season; but finding that they stood in need of a
 few more Carpenter's tools, we directed them procured
 in order as they stated to accommodate them
 in building their houses and barns, making their
 own ploughs The Onondago Tribe we found collected for
 the purpose as they said of returning thanks
 to the Great Spirit for favours received, and
 exhorting one another to refrain from evil practices
 and to persevere in well doin; we were informed
 it is their practice thus to meet four times in the
 year. They still refrain almost entirely from
 the use of ardent Spirits, and are gradually 
progressing in agricultural improvements, having
 lately commenced the raising other kinds of grain,
 besides Indian Corn, which a few years past
 was the only kind raised amongst them, and in
 which they are still increasing; yet in finding
 their necessity of further instruction in preserving
 their stalks for the benefit of wintering their Cattle;
 as well as in some other parts of their business,
 we requested Ephrain Webster their interpreter
 to afford them some assistance therein the present
 season; he being much interested in their welfare,
 is disposed to do all he reasonably can for them,
 and on moderate terms. They manifested their
 gratitude for the attention and assistance of
 Friends; and it appearing that the farming utensils
 heretofore furnished were much worn, we concluded
 to procure two ploughs, chains and several kinds
 of tools for their use; they are desirous that one
 or more of their young men should learn the
 blacksmith' trade, provided a smith can be
 procured to reside amongst them. We encouraged 
the men to persevere in the cultivation of their
 lands; and also suggested the propriety of their
 women learning the arts of spinning, knitting &
 after some time spent in deliberating on the subject,
 they requested time for further consideration in
 order unitedly to decide thereon In taking into view the situation of the
 different Tribes, we believe there is cause of
 encouragement for further exertions of Friends
 and as Absalom & Ruth Hatfield are dissmissed from
 their station, we think it right to suggest to the
 Committee the propriety of hiring a man to labor
 alternately with the Oneida & Stockbridge Tribes
 through the ensuing season; and also extending
 the same care towards the Onondago Tribe by
 employing Ephrain Webster to devote a part of
 his time amongst them, by which means an
 opportunity would be afforded for instructing
 them more effectually in the necessary branches
 of agricultural improvement We were accompanied by James Mott in the
 visit to Brothertown and Stockbridge, and by
 Joseph Frost and Sarah Collins to all the Tribes,
 who united with us in furnishing the articles
 above mentioned, as also in the propositions made
 to the Committee
 Thomas Willis 
 Anne Willis 
 Esther Griffin The attention of the Committee was satisfactory,
 and the appropriations made by them Committee
 approved of; and they having suggested the
 propriety of engaging a person to instruct the
 Oneida & Stockbridge Tribes in agriculture &
 it was the sense of the Committee that it would be
 expedient to procure a friend's family to reside
 amongst them, and if they cannot be found a
 suitable man friend & James Mott , Gideon Seaman 
 John Murray , Abraham J Underhill & Thomas
 Willis were appointed to attend to the service and
 authorized to engage a family or person accordingly. 
And they further proposing that some arrangement
 should be made with Ephraim Webster , resident
 amongst the Onondagoes to give up part of his time
 to the improvement and instruction of that Tribe;
 the Committee last named are authorized to make
 an agreement with him to that effect for such
 compensation as they shall deem suitable:
 and the Committee taking into consideration the
 proposition of engaging a Smith to reside
 amongst the Onondagoes with the view of instructing
 one or more of their young men in that art; the
 object appeared to be desirable, and it was concluded
 to leave the subject under the care of the same
 Committee to promote that object in such way
 as they shall judge best The Committee to settle Absalom &
 Ruth Hatfield's accounts were continued to the
 service. Matthew Franklin , Saml Parsons , 
Ann Shipley and Sarah Collins were appointed
 to essay a report to the Yearly Meeting & produce
 at our next Meeting Adjourned to 7'o'clock in the evening of the
 seventh day of the week, being the sitting of the
 next select Yearly Meeting At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian
 Concern held in New York the 21 of 5 mo 1814 Present 24 members we have also the
 company of several Friends of other Yearly Meetings. The Committee to examine Joseph Frost's 
 account made the following report viz It appears by a statement of his account
 there is a balance due him of $4 60/100 the Committee
 make the balance $4 40/100; and it also appears on
 the face of the account exhibited by him that on 
1 mo 21 1813 he sold 2 yoke of Oxen for 105 Dolls.
 payable in one year, and that there also remained
 due from Earl Halloway 25 Dolls a balance due
 for oxen sold him, making in the whole 125 Dolls.
 he however remarks that he will have to make some
 abatement to the persons to whom he sold the Oxen
 as one of them was sickly & afterwards died
 5 mo 14 1814 (signed) Thomas Eddy 
 Joseph Byrd The Committee to prepare a report to the
 Yearly Meeting, produced an Essay which with
 some alteration was approved directed to be signed
 by the Clerk & laid before the Yearly Meeting It
 is as follows To the Yearly Meeting The Committee appointed on the concern for
 the civilization & welfare of the Indians having
 given attention to the subject report that the
 different Tribes under our care have been visited 
by some of our number, and such attention &
 assistance afforded them as appeared necessary As former reports have detailed particular
 circumstances relative to the Tribes, we judge it
 not requisite to be very minute, but in general
 to state. At Brothertown in consequence
 of the attention of John & Thomas Dean , no
 assistance at present appears necessary, but as
 they have a prospect of removing from thence
 we think the care of Friends may still be useful. At New Stockbridge in consequence of the
 residence of white people among them they have
 been led to neglect the cultivation of their lands
 but as arrangements are made by Government
 to remove the white people, we are encouraged
 to hope they will in that case become necessarily
 more industrious A number of their women
 since the introduction of a spinning School 
have progressed in that art, and they have proceed
ed to make Cloth for their families own use;
 their example has introduced some of the men
 to commence raising flax: we think that the
 continuance of this business affords a prospect
 of usefulness to that people; and we believe if
 persevered in will gradually promote habits
 of industry more generally amongst them. The South settlement of the Oneida Tribe
 appears to have been gradually improving in
 agriculture; some of this Tribe for a number
 of years have refrained from ardent spirits;
 they last summer convened in council and unitedly
 agreed to refrain entirely in future from the
 use of it. One of their women appears willing
 to take charge of a spinning & knitting school,
 on materials being furnished them for the
 purpose, which the Committee has directed to be
 procured. 
From the general temperance of the Onondago 
Tribe, & their increasing industry in having
 raised various kinds of grain & we feel encouraged
 to hope that the labor and care of Friends
 extended to them has not been unavailing:
 they with the other Tribes have manifested
 gratitude for the attention & assistance afforded
 them. Since the Committee performed their visit
 to the different Tribes, information has been
 received, that through the influence of the white
 people, nearly all the men, except the Brother
town Tribe, have been induced to go into the
 war, but that they returned in a few weeks
 to their dwellings, & resumed their former
 pursuits, but we are apprehensive that the
 examples of intemperance & vice exhibited to
 their view during their absence will have a
 tendency to retard their improvement in 
sobriety, and render the care of Friends more
 peculiarly necessary to their welfare Signed by direction & on behalf of the Commt.
 5 mo 21 1814 S Parsons Clrk The Committee appointed to procure a
 suitable family or friend to instruct the Oneida
 & Stockbridge Tribes & for other objects stated in
 the minute of last Meeting, reported that no
 family had been found, but that a number
 of the Committee had gone to reside amongst
 them for that purpose during the summer;
 & that they were not prepared to report on the
 other subjects entrusted to their care; they
 were continued. The attention of the Committee was engaged
 in the consideration of the propriety of making
 an appointment to visit the Tribes in the 
Western parts of the State under our care, with
 a view of promoting their civilization & general
 improvement & to this service the following
 friends were appointed, to wit. James Mott 
 Trip Mosher , Ruth Spencer , Phebe Howes ,
 Joseph Talcott , Samuel Parsons , Phebe Field 
 & Josiah Field . Adjourned to six o'clock in the evening
 preceding the Meeting for Sufferings in
 the 12th month next at this house. At a Meeting of the Committee held 12th
 of 12th Mo 1814
 Present 24 members The Committee to visit the Tribes under
 our care made the following report
 We of the Committee appointed to visit 
the Indians report That we have made a visit to the Oneida South 
Settlement & had a conference with their Chiefs &
 principal men on such subjects as required attention. Notwithstanding that part of the Tribe have been
so far misled as to go into the war, yet the injury
 they have sustained is apparently less than might
 have been expected, their improvements in agriculture
 continue, and intemperance does not seem to have
 gained ground amongst them, some of their elder
 men give way to this vice, but we are informed that
 their women and most of their young men are
 free from it William Ruthbone , a young
 friend of the neighbourhood, son of Ackus Ruthbone 
 has opened a school & from twenty to thirty scholars
 attend & the number is likely to increase we
 have agreed that he shall have a compensation
 at the rate of $250 per ann & board himself, till the 
General Committee shall resulut on the subject. On conferring with a number of the women
 who are much interested in learning to spin we
 concluded to supply them with two pounds of wool
 & six pounds of flax each; there are about Twenty
 four who are learning, and as more wheels are
 needed we concluded to furnish them with one great
 & one small wheel, & a loom which they were
 very desirous of having; as one of their number
 has learned to weave We proceeded to Stockbridge & had a conference
 in the Meeting House with such of the Tribe as
 could be collected They like the other Tribes have
 unhappily taken part in the war, and their
 habits of intemperance as might be expected are
 not lessened; their women have made great
 advancement in spinning, about sixty have
 learned in a greater or less degree, and in order
 to encourage them in it, we concluded to furnish 
them with there more great & thence more small
 wheels, and in order that they might be led to
 future exertion by reaping some benefit from
 their labour to furnish each spinner with two
 pounds of wool, and we think it would be proper
 to furnish them with the same quantity of flax
 as is proposed for the Oneidas Several of the
 Stockbridge Tribe raise flax, & a number of them
 have sheep; and we would propose that flaxseed
 for sowing be furnished the ensuing season to
 both Tribes The Stockbridge Tribe stated that
 Mary Doxtady has devoted considerable of her
 time to instruct them in spinning, and proposed
 whether Friends could not see the way to make
 her some compensation, which we think reasonable
 & proper & refer it to the consideration of the General
 Committee; as also relative to some compensation
 to Nancy , wife of Aaron Smith for similar
 services amongst the Oneidas On deliberating on the propriety of proceeding to
 Onondago, we learned that having been engaged
 in the war, they had introduced the smallpox
 into the settlement, of which several had died & 
a number were now ill. We were further
 informed that Ephrain Webster their interpreter
 was absent from home; from these circumstances
 we concluded the views of the Committee would
 not be answered by making them a visit at
 the present time We were accompanied in the visit by our
 friend Charles Willetts , who has been nearly four
 months at Oneida & its neighbourhood, and it is but
 justice to him to state that his presence & services
 amongst them have been very useful at a time
 when they were much wanted; and we are
 thence led to give our opinion of the necessity
 of having a friends' family resident amongst them. Oneida 25 of 8 mo 1814 James Mott Tripp Mosher ,
 Ruth Spencer , Phebe Howes , Samuel Parsons It is believed that the Brothertown Indians have
 made a considerable improvement in building good
 barns & comfortable houses, & in cultivating their
 lands in some parts of the Town, but in other
 parts there is but little or no improvement either
 in their morals or husbandry, though it is
 hoped that the spirit for war has very much
 subsided, and those who volunteered their service
 in the army are returning to their homes & business. The School in the winter season was encouraging
 but this summer it is small as usual. Tripp Mosher 
 Phebe Howes 
 Ruth Spencer The attention of the sub committee was satisfactory
 and the subjects referred by it to the meeting were
 considered. The arrangement respecting a School at
 Oneida was approved; but information was now 
given by one of the Sub Committee that the School
 Com has been of latter time discontinued in consequence
 of the small number of Scholars at this season of
 the year and other circumstances. The Committee
 taking the subject into consideration it appeared to be
 desirable that a suitable friend should be engaged
 to open a School amongst them the ensuing spring
 & that in selecting him attention should be given
 to his qualifications to furnish them advice &
 assistance in their agricultural & other concerns;
 & it was concluded to appoint a Committee to enquire
 for a friend of this description either single or
 having a family as should appear to them expedient,
 & the following friends were appointed to the service
 to wit- James Mott Gideon Seaman , Jn Murray 
 & Thomas Willis. The proposition of the Committee for
 supplying the Oneida & Stockbridge Tribes, with
 flax, wool, wheels & flaxseed for sowing was 
approved; and it was concluded to allow Mary
 Doxtady $20- & Nancy Smith $10- for their
 services in instructing the women of those
 Tribes in spinning during the last summer
 & the present winter. Information was given by the Sub Committee
 that during their visit they learned that the small
pox had been introduced amongst the Onondagos
 & was likely to spread amongst the Onondagos
 & was likely to spread amongst the Oneida & 
Stockbridge Tribes & that they had therefore judged it expedient
 to have them inoculated with the kine pock, which
 had accordingly been done, and about a thousand
 persons had been vaccinated accordingly The human proceeding of the Sub Committee
 was approved of & the cost thereof One hundred
 five Dollars was directed to be paid by the Treasurer
 to James Mott , with the sums directed in the
 preceding minute, also Fifty two 8/100 Dollars 
compensation to William Ruthbone for 2./2 months
 school keeping & Six 2/100 Dolls. to Aeors Ruthbane
 for keeping a pair of Oxen for the Oneidas The Sub Committee reviving the subject
 of the Gore of land in the Oneida South Settlement
 which still occasions anxiety to the Indians, it
 was concluded to place it under the care of the a
 Committee & Thomas Eddy , Saml. Parsons &
 John Murray were appointed to the service. The Committee appointed in 12 mo 1813 to
 procure a friend or family reside amongst
 the Oneidas & for other objects stated in the
 Minute of their appointment not being prepared
 to report are continued & desired to give such
 attention thereto as may enable them to report
 at our next Meeting; & Ja. Mott was at his
 request released & Matthew Franklin added to 
the appointment. Matthew Franklin , Samuel Parsons ,
 Anne Mott & Sarah Collins were appointed to
 essay a report to the Yearly Meeting & produce
 at our next meeting. Adjourned to seven 'o'clock in the evening of
 the seventh day of the week, being the Sitting
 of the next Select Yearly Meeting. Minute ommitted in Meeting of5 mo 1814 The Committee to examine Absalom & Ruth
 Hatfield's accounts reported the performance
 of the service & that including compensation to the
 time of Absalom's death- there is due the sum
 of Two hundred seventy three Dollars sixty eight
 Cents, which the Treasurer was requested to pay
 Ruth Hatfield . At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian
 Concern held in New York 28th of 5 mo 1815 The Members generally present we have also
 the company of several Friends of the neighbouring
 Yearly Meetings The Committee appointed to procure a
 Teacher to reside amongst the Oneidas, or a
 suitable friend to advise and assist them in their
 concerns, reported that they had given ihereto, but
 had not succeeded in the objects of their enquiry:
 the subject is continued under the care of James
 Mott, Gideon Seaman , John Murray , Thomas
 Willis Isaac Thorn , Zebulon Haxsee & Charles
 Willetts. The Committee appointed to attend to the Gore
 of land in Oneida reported that it had claimed
 their attention, but that no arrangement relative 
thereto had yet been made; they were continued
 to the service The Committee to essay a report to the Yearly
 Meeting, produced it accordingly; it was with
 some alteration, approved, directed to be signed
 by the Clerk andd laid before the Yearly Meeting
 It is as follows To the Yearly Meeting The Committee on the Concern for the
 civilization and welfare of the Indians report The we have continued our attention to
 the trust confided to us; and the Tribes under
 our notice, excepting one, have been visited by
 some of our number, from whose report we
 are enabled to give a summary account of 
their condition. No material change appears
 to have taken place in the Brothertown Tribe, (excepting
 that improvements have been made in the erection
 of several barns-) but as heretofore some are
 sober and industrious and others the reverse The same remark is applicable to the men of
 the Stockbridge Tribe. The South settlement
 of the Oneida Tribe affords encouragement by
 their improvement in agriculture, and it is hoped
 that the injury to their morals which is produced
 by the part which they and thelate other Tribes
 have taken in the late war will gradually be
 retrieved, for it was a satisfaction to remark
 that their young men manifested less disposition
 to enter into the army than the elder chiefs, and
 their stay was not long. The School is continued at Brothertown, and
 one was taught for some time in the summer at
 Oneida, by a young friend of the neighbourhood
 but has since been discontinued. Satisfactory improvement continues to be made
 by the Stockbridge and Oneida women in spinning
 in each of these Tribes a School for their improve
ment therein has been kept, and the Committee
 have rendered them assistance in makeing compens
ation to the Teachers, and in furnishing
 additional quantities of wool and flax & a
 number of spinning wheels The Onondago Tribe was not visited on
 account of the absence of their Interpreter & in
 consequence of the small pox having been
 introduced from the army & being very 
prevalent amongst them when the Committee
 was in that neighbourhood. There being reason to
 apprehend that it would spread in the Oneida &
 Stockbridge Tribes, the Committee judged it would
 comport with the benevolent views of Friends to
 endeavor to preserve them from the ravages of
 this malady & concluded to have them inoculated
 with the Kine Pock, which after considerable
 difficulty occasioned by their prejudice against it
 was effected, & about a thousand individuals were
 vaccinated. The Onondagoes were by some
 other means inoculated with small pox The Committee are very desirous that a
 friend with a family, or if such cannot be
 found, a suitable single man may be induced
 to reside amongst the Oneidas for the purpose 
of rendering them advice and assistance in their
 concerns, and of taking charge of a School amongst
 them for which they manifest much solicitude. Signed by direction & on behalf of the Committee
 New York 28th of 5 mo 1815 Samuel Parsons Clerk Adjourned to the 4th day evening next at 7 'o'clock Thirty first of the month, Friends assembled Tho Eddy informed that he and another member
 of the Committee had loaned Benjn & Jacob
 Fowler of the Brothertown Tribe Nineteen Dolls.
 to enable them to return home, and that there is
 a probability that the money can be collected from
 them there; The Treasurer is requested to pay
 T Eddy the money & receive B & J Fowler a Note
 therefor Tho Eddy also informed that he had 
obtained of Eleazer Williams , an Indian of the
 St. Regis Tribe, one hundred Spelling Books in
 the Oneida Language, cost Five Dollars which
 the Treasurer was requested to pay & receive the
 Books A Committee having been nominated at the
 preceding sitting to prepare an address to the
 different Tribes of Indians within this State
 produced an Essay, which with some alterations
 was approved, & left under the acre of Willet
 Hicks Tho Eddy Jno Barrow , Jno Murray 
 & Saml Parsons to have a suitable number
 printed & placed under the care of the visiting
 Committee for distribution. Charles Willetts , John Barrow , Willet
 Hicks, Josiah Field , John Griffin Amy 
Hull, Hannah Lines , Phebe Willis & Sarah
 Sutton, were appointed to visit the different
 Tribes under our notice, and attend to such
 concerns as are interesting to their welfare &
 improvement; and in a particular manner
 relative to the erection of a School House at
 Oneida. Adjourned to Six 'o'clock in the evening
 preceding the Meeting for Sufferings in Twelfth
 Month next at this House At a Meeting of the Committee on the Indian
 Concern held in New York 11th of 12 mo 1815 Present 22 members The Committee to visit the Tribes under our 
notice made the following report Agreeably to our appointment six of our
 number have visited the different Tribes of the
 Natives which have been under the care of the
 Committee, had meetings of conference with them
 at each place, read the address from the Committee
 to them, which with the remarks made to them
 appeared to be recieved with much cordiality We found amongst the men at Brothertown
 some who are improving their land, and provide
 comfortably for their families, which may also
 be said of those at Stockbridge & the Oneida; but
 many of them as heretofore are much addicted
 to habits of intemperance, by which means their
 families are brought to want. But we were
 pleased to find that the Women at Stockbridge
 & the Oneida are making considerable improvement 
in the art of spinning, and appeared to be much
 interested in it. We understood that about sixty
 of the women at Stockbridge have learned to spin
 and about thirty at Oneida. We were told that
 two of their number at Stockbridge who had learned
 to spin in the School of Mary Doxtader have
 made during the last year each sixty yards of
 linen cloth, and a number of them have made
 cloth for fulling; and in order to encourage them
 still further, the Committee have thought proper to
grant to each spinner at Oneida two pounds of wool
 and those of Stockbridge & Oneida two pounds of
 flax each. The Committee have thought fit
 to furnish the Stockbridge Tribe with a loom &
 aparatus for weaving, and two pair of Cards They also concluded to allow Mary Doxtader 
 twenty Dollars for her continued attention to 
the spinning school, and Nancy Smith Ten
 Dollars the same that was allowed them for
 their service last year At the present time there
 are three Schools kept up amongst them, namely
 one at Brothertown under the care of Thomas 
 Dean taught by a female of their own Tribe,
 that at Stockbridge by a young man of that people,
 at Oneida by William Ruthbone , and they have
 a School House at the last place built partly by
 the Natives themselves which is left with Ackus
 Rathbone to complete; who has also cheerfully
 undertaken at the request of the Committee to
 furnish them with the before mentioned articles
 and to give such attention as he may from
 time to time judge necessary, for which services
 he is to have a reasonable compensation We also paid a visit to the Onondago 
settlement & sat with them in Council; there being also
 present about twenty eight of the principal men of
 the Tanawanto Tribe who had assembled there
 to solemnized the funeral of their great Prophet
 who decreased a few days before at Onondago, where
 he had paid his usual annual visit. It is
 believed he has been very useful in reforming
 these Nations and divers ohers whom he had
 visited once in the year, and by precept and
 example encouraged temperance & sobriety
 amongst those nations with great success A sober man, one of the Tonawanta Tribe
 was our Interpreter; he appeared to be much
 interested with the subjects contained in the
 address, and we believe he communicated it
 faithfully to those assembled, which appeared
 to be received with much satisfaction by those
 of the different Tribes present. Andrew were 
informed by our Interpreter that his Nation
 (the Tonawantoes) were a sober people, which
 we understood was generally the ease with those
 at Onondagoe many of them appear to have
 comfortable houses, and some have Barns;
 their corn appeared promising, and from the
 appearance of things amongst them, we believe
 that they generally live comfortably in their way
 and we apprehended that Ephraim Webster's 
 attention to their Oxen, and other concerns
 would be useful; he was accordingly agreed
 with to have some oversight of that Tribe
 for the ensuing year, and for such services
 he is to have a reasonable compensation Signed on behalf of the Committee, by
 8 mo 26th 1815 John Griffin 
 Phebe Willis The report of the Committee was satisfactory; and
 the appropriations it had directed were approved The Committee appointed to engage a Teacher
 to reside amongst the Oneidas, or a suitable friend
 to advise and assist them in their concerns reported
 attention to the service, and that William Ruthbone 
 had been engaged & has the charge of the School
 at Oneida at present, but is likely to discontinue
 it before long The Committee is continued
 to attend to the subject. The Committee appointed to attend to
 the Gore of land in the Oneida South settlement
 reported that nothing had yet been effected;
 they were continued. The Committee being informed that the
 Bond of Peter G Stuyvesant is likely to be 
paid off, previous to another Meeting, Isaac Hicks 
 & Thomas Willis were appointed to assist the
 Treasurer in investing the money. John Murray , Thomas Willis , Anne
 Mott & Phebe Willis were appointed to essay a
 report to the Yearly Meeting & produce at our
 next Meeting. The Committee appointed to have the
 Address to the different Tribes of Indians
 within this State printed, reported that it
 had been accordingly done, and such
 number as was judged suitable, delivered to
 the visiting Committee; & that the Cost was
 which the Treasurer was requested
 to pay Adjourned to 7'o'clock in the
 evening of the next Select Yearly Meeting at
 this house The Address referred to is as follows
