being a deputation from the general Council of Indians who for several Days past have been deliberating on the proposals made to them by Col.
Pickering, waiting on us at our Lodgings with  Horatio Jones Interpreter. they desired that as they had some thing of a secret nature to communicate
we would retire with them to some private place, which being complyd with Red  Jacket addressed us nearly as follows Brothers You see here four of
use of the six Nations; who are assembled at this place in the will of the great Spirit to transact the business of the treaty, you have been
waiting here a long time and visited by our chiefs and as yet no marks of respect have been shewn you. We understand you told Saguaresy that you
should not have come but at our request & that you stand ready to afford us any assistance which lay in your power. -- Brothers we hope you will make
your minds easy, as we who are now here are but Children, the Anscients being diceased; we know that you & our forefathers transacted business
together  that you look to the great Spirit for his directions & assistance & take no part in war. -- Brothers you all know the proposals made by
us to Col. Pickering as well as the offers made by him to us we are now all in the presence of the great spirit and we place more confidence in you
than heretofore, as you escpressed your desire for peace we now desire youre help & assistance we hope you will not deceive us. if you should do so,
we shall no more place any  confidence in makind; we wish that if you know the will of Congress or the extent of the commissioner's power that you
will candidly inform us. Brothers, We Wish that what we are now communicating may be kept secret. We are will to give up the four mile path from
Johnsons Landsling place to Caynga Creek, the other part of it from thence to Buffaloe Creek we with to reserve on account of of the fisheries &
which would correspond with the treaty held with Sir Wm. Johnson. We desire to know if you can inform us why the triangle on lake Erie can not be
given up -- Cornplanter & Capt. Brant who where only Warrior Chiefs were the persons who attended the treaty at Fort Stanwix & they were to have
sent forward the proposals for our more general consideration at that time old smoke was alive who was a Man of great Understanding; but they were
threatened into a compliance in consequence of which Capt. Wm. Brant went to Canada disireing Cornplanter to do the best he could. They then
presented seven strings of wampum & with drew & agreed to return to hear our answer at the 3rd hour this afternoon  The time allowed to Consider &
digest an answer being too Short and the Indians returning rather earlier than the time appointed they cheerfully proposed to leave it under our
consideration till tomorrow earnestly desireing we should be serious in deliberating on it. 1st 11Mo 1794 This morning the same Chiefs with the
Interpreter attended according to our agreement of Yesterday, the following answer as agreed on was communicated to them Brothers. We have
considered what you said to us yesterday and shall answer you in a few words. We are thankful to the the great Spirit that he has preserved us in
health to see each others faces at this council fire; we and our Brethren at home have the same good will towards you as our forefathers had and
are desirous to afford you any service in our power, & that you may cherish peace with one another and with all men believing this will greatly
contribute to your happiness we sympathize with you in your sufferings & distress, & wish strict Justice to be done you respecting your Lands, you
have been informed we can take no part in war, which is one great reason why we cannot be active in civil Government and therefore are not capable
of Judging all of your grievences, especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties of late years have not fully come to our knowledge; you have
spoken to us respecting the piece of Land between Caynga & Buffaloe Creeks, as we are unacquainted with the Comissioners power we can give you no
satisfactory answer on that subject. if it appears to be a matter of great importance to you it would be proper to lay it before him; the Land you
mentioned  along Lake Erie you have been already acquainted that Congress has sold it to Pennsylvania & we do not suppose the Commisioner's has
power to relinquish it; it is true that the President and his Counsellors have impowered a Commissioner to treat with you but we thing the
Government had no design to compel you, you have Men amongst you of Good Understanding & sufficient penetration to discover what you Just rights
are & if you minds are not easy with the proposals that have been made, we make no doubt but the Ears of the president & the great Counsil of the
united states will be open to hear you & to them we conceive you have a right to appeal. We desire wisdom may conduce your Councils that whatever
is done may tend to promote harmony & peace. We then returned the strings of Wampum. 11 Mo 12th 1794 According to the agreements of last evening

& the Indians returning rather earlier than the time appointed, they chearfully proposed to leave it under our Consideration till tomorrow,
earnestly desiring we should be serious in deliberating on it. 11th Month 1st This Morning the same Chiefs with the Interpreter attending according
to our agreement of yesterday, the following answer as agreed on was communicated to them Brothers, We have considered what you said to us yesterday
& shall answer you in a few words; We are thankful to the great Spirit that he has preserved us in health to see each others faces at this Council
fire; we & our Brethren at home have the same good will towards you as our forefathers had, & are desirous to afford you any service in our power, &
that you may cherish peace with one another & with all Men, believing this will greatly contribute to your happiness; we sympathize with you in your
sufferings & distress, & wish strict justice to be done you respecting your Lands, you have been informed we can take no part in war, which is one
great reason why we cannot be active in civil Government & therefore are not capable of judging of all your grievances, especially as the
transactions at Indian Treaties of late years have not fully come to our knowledge; you have spoken to us respecting the piece of Land between
Caynga & Buffaloe Creeks, as we are unacquainted with the Commissioner's power we can give you no satisfactory answer on that subject, [which?]
appears to be a matter of importance to you, it would be proper to lay it before him; the Land you mention along Lake Erie you have been already
acquainted that Congress has sold it to Pennsylvania, & we do not suppose the Commissioner has power to relinquish it; It is true the President &
his Counsellors have impowered a Commissioner to treat with you, but we think the Government has no design to compel you, you have Men amongst you
of good Understanding & sufficient penetration to discover what your just rights are, & if your minds are not easy with the proposals that have been
made, we make no doubt but the Ear of the President & the great Council of the United States will be open to hear you, & to them we conceive you have
a right to appeal; we desire Wisdom may conduct your Councils that whatever is done may tend to promote harmony & peace. We then returned the
Strings of Wampum. 11th Mo: 12th 1794 According to the agreement of last evening about thirty or forty of the Sachems & Chief Warriors met at our
Lodgings & delivered the following Speech by Farmer's Brother the Chief Sachem. Brothers of he people call'd Quakers, I wish you would attend to
what we who are now present are about to say, we speak as one. yesterday after receiving your invitation to come and partake of your presents, we
agreed to meet here this Morning, to communicate a few words, which we will now do. 10th Month 31st 1794: Four of the Sachems viz Clear Sky, Red
Jacket, Sagnaresy and another (whose name we were not acquainted with) being a deputation from the general Counsil for Indians who for several Days
past have been deliberating on the proposals made to them by Col: Pickering, waited on us at our Lodgings with Horatio Jones Interpreter, they
desired that as they had something of a secret nature to communicate we would retire with them to some private place, which being complyed with, Red
Jacket addressed us nearly as follows. Brothers, you see here four of us of the six Nations, who are assembled at this place in the will of the
great Spirit to transact the Business of the Treaty, you have been waiting here a long time & visited by our Chiefs & as yet no marks of respect
have been shown you. We understand you told Sagnaresy that you should not have come but at our request & that you stood ready to afford us any
assistance which lay in your power. Brothers we hope you will make you minds easy, as we who are now here are but Children, the Antients being
deceased; we know that your & our forefathers transacted business together, that you look to the great Spirit for his direction & assistance, & take
no part in war. Brothers you all know the proposals made by us to Col: Pickering as well as the offers made by him to us, we are now all in the
presence of the great Spirit & we place more confidence in you than heretofore, as you expressed you desire for peace we now desire your help &
assistance, we hope you will not deceive us, if you should do so, we shall no more place any confidence in Mankind; we wish that if you know the
will of Congress or the extent of the Commissioner's powers that you will candidly inform us. Brothers, we wish that what we are now communicating
may be kept secret; we are willing to give up the four Mile path from Johnson's Landing place to Caynga Creek, the other part of it from thence to
Buffaloe Creek we wish to reserve on account of the Fisheries &c, which would correspond with the Treaty held with Sir Wm. Johnson. We desire to know
if you can inform us why the Triangles on Lake Erie cannot be given up. Cornplanter & Captain Brant who were only Warrior Chiefs were the persons
who attended the Treaty at Fort Stanwix, & they were to have sent forward the proposals for our more general consideration, at that time Old Sonoke
was alive who was a Man of great Understanding; but they were threatned into a compliance in consequence of which Capt. Brant went of to Canada,
desiring Cornplanter to do the best he could. They then presented seven strings of wampum & withdrew, & agreed to return to hear our answer at the
3rd hour this afternoon Brothers, I am very glad you have lengthened out your patience to see the end of the business which is now brought to a
close: I thank the great Spirit that he preserved you in Health from the time you left your seats till you arrived here, & has continued to preserve
you to this time; we put you under the protection of the same great Spirit on your return, hoping he may conduct your home in safety & that you may
find you Friends & Families well. On you return we should be very happy to hear that you got safe home, & it would be very acceptable to the  Chiefs
now present to be informed of it by Letter. We give hearty thanks to the descendants of Onas, that you so willingly rose from your seats to attind
this Council fire according to our request. Here are the Articles of the Treaty for you to look over in order to impress your Minds that you may
tell them to your Brethren who are sitting on their seats at home. Brothers, you have attended this Treaty a long time the Articles which we have
now signed, I hope you fully understand now as we have shown them to you we would with to know your opinion whether we have made a good peace or
not; as we cannot read we are liable to be deceived, as you have no doubt considered them we wish to know your minds whether there being any flaw or
catch in them which might hereafter occasion uneasiness. If you think that peace is now established on a good foundation, we wish you would come
forward & sign the Articles, as you are a people who are desirous of promoting peace & these writings are for that purpose, we hope you will have no
objection but all come forward & put your Names to them, & this would be great satisfaction to us. Our answer to the Indians was in substance as
follows Brothers, We left our homes at your request & have freely come to see you & sat patiently with you during the transactions of the Treaty, we
are glad to see the Treaty Business brought to a close, we hope the chain is brightened & that the peace will be lasting; we have compared the
Articles of the Treaty given to the Indians with those retained by the United States & find them to be true Copies of each other, with respect to
our signing we hope you will excuse us, for altho' we believe no deception is intended by the Commissioner, yet there was a number of other people
present, & we wish not to be held up to public view, as we informed you before that we do not interfere with Government as we can take no part in
war; neither do we apprehend ourselves competent judges, as the transactions at Treaties held since the war have not fully been made public. We hope
you will abide by the agreement which you have signed & be at peace, & it is our earnest desire that you might more & more be redeemed from the
Spirit of war & cherish the number of your Friends: We wish that when you apprehend yourselves agrieved you would make your Grievances know & not
seek to revenge them, as a Society we have had experience of the benifits arising from these  peaceable principles for the space of near 150 years,
& find we can do better without fighting then with it. We still continue to feel the same good will towards our Brothers the Indians as formerly &
are willing in every strait & difficulty to afford you any assistance in our power. We fervently wish you may live in Love one with another. The
Farmer's Brother then made the following conclusive speech Brothers, We are very glad to see you; when we sent for you, our desire was that you might
sit by our sides & afford your assistance to make a good peace. Last year we invited you to come to Sandusky, you willingly rose from your seats &
came forward, you know how things turned out, it was not the will of the great Spirit that a Treaty should take place, yet we thank you because you
came so readily; we have many times heard the voice of Onas, it as always good to us we have now heard it again & what you have said is good, you
have seen the writings by which we are bound, you say you are not concerned in public affairs, and no hard thoughts concerning you, on account of
your not putting your names to it. Brothers, the great Spirit give this Island to us the White People have increased greatly, there is no difference
between the Red People & the White they are all one & ought to be Brothers & live in Peace one with another. 2 mo 23th 1798 Philad. At a conferrence
