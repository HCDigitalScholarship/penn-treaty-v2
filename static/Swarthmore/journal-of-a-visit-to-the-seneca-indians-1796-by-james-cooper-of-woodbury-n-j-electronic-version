 which was the earth sunk on a body of between two & three
 Acres to near sixty feet perpendicular to measure the 
 the Bank of Earth it was Crost of from its sink was on seventh
 Day last seen by several people on the opposite side of the Creek
 it was to be sure a strange sight to see how jostled & jumbled a
 situation the sudden stroke of a few minutes left in it so vastly uneven very
 wide cracks opening so wide as it was with difficulty we
 could pass to view it. These was at the time a flock of sheep
 grazing thereon and in there surprise huddled together after
 taking a view to our satisfaction and admiration returnd

 few other members & a few more friendly People & professors

 to me the concern it was to her that they were so situated the Custom
 of the place was such as to give her concern on their children’s
 account that her daughter they hadseveral times had invitations to go
 to their public amusements, that the refusal seems strange

 onon the Road, we this morning we breakfasted
 10 miles on our Road where we were told that Cherry Valley
 lay eighteen miles south of the river where we then were 
 we now left the bottom land our Road Rough and stony for nearly
 twenty miles many new settlements, it appearing fertile where
 not Clear'd Coated with the Sugar Maple, Beech and with what the
 people call Black Beech with we call it Black Ash of which
 they chiefly fence in many places much of the white pines.
 The Sugar Maple was easily know from the many scars that had
 been made from time to time to run the sap, some were as
 large as two feet Diameter we reach'd the German Flats to Dine

 setted by the Germans Emigrating from Albany nearly
 Eighty years ago after Dinner cross'd over the River

 fruitful appearance, we rode this afternoon a mostly in about
 25 miles & most of the way in a new setted country setted within
 a dozen Years since the war. The Houses new land new and settlements
 so near that it resembles a town most of the way, many
 Stately well built Houses built of wood, Stone appear scarce here 
 this morning The Eleventh, this morning had an opportunity
 with Colonell Floyd who to our staisfaction happened
 to be in the Village who appeared to be a free openhearted
 sincere friend to us & our Concern gave us all the information
 he was capable of with respect to our move & his own
 Judgment of what might be useful afternoon we left the place & in
 in 14 Miles riding reached Captain Hendricks Hindrech
 Smiths an Oneida Indian setted nearly the line
 between the Oneidas & Stockbridges where we staid all Night
 it being the sun being set by the time we got hereby we sent a note of our
 being here to Captain Hendricks about three miles off
 the road being very bad which has been the case all the
 way from Whites town into a new Road lying on bad
 bottom for a Road the Timber very thick of different kinds
 there largest Kind is what they call Basswood the bark of
 which the Indians roof their houses, our Indian landlord
 & wife appears frugal people & somewhat of an Industrious
 appearance having nineteen two yoke of oxen
 several cows, his stock of Horn kind we were told was
 nineteen, twenty hogs little and big. He this morning
 which is the twelfth of the month informed us he had lost by Deathsome
 distemper particularly attendant to his place within
 five years Eleven Horses the eleventh died this morning
 he now lives in a house having two rooms on a floor and
 has the materials for Building a frame house to be covered with shingles over a
 sellar the workman to begin the work tomorrow he has
 eight Children the youngest in the arms the Wife speaks
 English he but very little, this morning Captain Hendricks 
 with one or two others came to meet & accompany us
 to his house where we Breakfasted 
& whereby his consent - at our accustomed 
 time we sat down with in his with his consort & company in order to perform our
 duty to Worship he after which his freedom
 was ask'd with respect to our siting down in our orderly
 manner to worship the good spirit for which he freely
 consented to Likewise he with his wife and family
 and several others that came in sat with us in a very
 Solid commendable manner, the wife appears
 to be Religious worthy woman observing her to be
 employ'd in Catichizing her Children in the afternoon
 she was Asked whether she was in the practice of so doing
 on first days she reply'd she was regularly & that
 twice in the day which practice of inculcating the good
 principals of Religion in Children in the afternoon
 on first days is a requested having he requested that
 the Chiefs of his nation might have an opportunity of
 communicating some things they had on their minds which
 they did in the evening, several of their Chiefs assembling, Hendricks 
 began with a relation of the origin of their present settlement
 there unhappy uneasiness in their little tribe from such as said
were disposed to live without a necessary subordination that to Rules &
 was necessary to govern all Bodies of People notwithstanding their body was
 small yet they had found it necessary to have Rules to govern
 them then he Rehears'd part of them which appeared well calculated
 to preserve harmony & Concord among them, but some of them
 still remaining unwilling to sign them such they deprive
 of certain privaledges untill they sign, that theywhich they
 at any time may do & then have equal priviledges with the rest
 of their brethren 13th of 6th month We met them in general counsel their Missionary
 John Sargeant was ask'd to walk in with us as the place of meeting their meeting house in within a few rods of this as we could do no less
 having had an invitation this morning by a few lines to breakfast
 with him & Daughters which we kindlyaccepted, after we were
 seated. Hendrick in behalf of his people opened the Counsel by
 saying they were glad to see us, and were now ready to hear what
 we had to say, then we proceeded to open our business and pay
and our pay after which we endeavouring to impress them
 with a sense of the necessity their present state required of exerting themselves 
 in clearing their Lands, Tilling the ground, Raising grain,
 Cattle, Sheep, & Hogs, that they might subsist by what their
 farms land would produce were they to apply themselves to an
 industrious care & frugality and not indulge themselves with the
 delight of hunting the wild game, for it had very much fail'd
themlessened already and would continue to declinegrow scarcer and scarcer decrease, and with respect
 to that grievous evil they were so much addicted to of getting
 in Liquor that the sooner they took to this market betook themselves
 to this way of life the better, and likewise the great need there was for them to
 desist from that evil systemgrievous practice they are so accustomed
 to that is of getting in the excessive love of liquor, that it was one of their vices that not
 only displeased the Great Spirit, but had & would still whilst they
 continued in the practice be a hindrance to their Reformation
 in a life of civilization & a comfortable, plentiful living which we
 much desired to see them enjoy, after we had made an end of
 what one had to say we waited for them to pause & confer
 together a little time, then Hendrick express'd, that they were glad
 to see us & hear our words which they would as it were swallow
 down & give us an answer then they had considered them. One
 antient grave man whose name was Samuel a Moravian
 said he was very glad to see us & in a broken uninteligent manner
 expressed himself, by which we he was under sensible impressions of by a Religious which was Man
 attended with feelings after which meeting we went to Captain Hendricks &
 eat dinner after which some time after took a walk to see his wheat
 field about a mile off his house through the woods soil very
 good appearing chiefly a mold rather inclining to too much wet
 for winter grain, which in my opinion is generally the case in
 this Country, perhaps after it becomes clear'd and exposed to the sun
 it may very much change, his field of wheat was of the summer
 kind and about four acres, very Rank and Strong, their land
 has abundance of timber I think it has the preference in that
 respect of any I ever saw or at least untill I came very near their teritory,
 the extent of their lands (that is the Stockbridge
 was measured them by miles, a gift of the Oneidas to them of
 six miles square, Indian reprobating the very Idea of selling
 land to their brothers the Indians, and when the Stockbridge
 Indians had a mind to move tofrom their settlement of Old Stockbridge
 in New England, having an opportunity atwhile
 the Oneidas left their habitations in the last war & abode took
 Refuge at Schanectady, they proposed to contract with them for
 a settlement among them, they refused selling their Lands to them
 but gave it them as before mentioned, they then their Acts
 of benevolence in this way has extended to other tribes of their brethren, as
 the Brothertowns, the remaining branches of several nations
 collectedly and seated in the same manner, which in their settlement
 is distinguished by the Brothertown Settlement also the Tuscaroras
 are settled in the same manner, they have not any granted them by covenant this makes them uneasy Stockbridges town or settlement
 is about the middle of their lands one way, resembling a Village
 near a considerable Stream of water on which they have
 erected their Saw mill, at the Tale of the Saw mill they have p 
propose erecting their a Grist mill, the saw mill has been
 sometime disabledand yet remains in an unfit situation to
 do any service for them, the Dam having a breach thereinin it
 they appear to be concerned about it and had proposed this day
 tomorrow to mend the breach, the missionary inform'd us
 there was two of their men had learnt to saw very well & by
 the appearance of the boards that was cut at the mill it appear'd
 they understood the business very well, their houses are built
 with round logs as high as the Square, & roof'd principally with the
 Bass tree Bark which with a little frames makes a tight
 roof and will last for several years, but since they have their
 saw mill at worktheir Ideas as to houses seems to be a little
 exalted that they are preparing for Squar'd log houses of Shingle Roofs
 Hendrick Aupaumet said he raised a hundred bushel of
 Wheat last year & had sold 50 Bushels of Indian Corn 14th: of 6th: This morning Rainy we did not send to the Oneidas untill
 after breakfast then sent them word to meet us at two o’clock, in the
 afternoon it clear'd away and walked to their Village about four miles from
 the Stockbridges, on the way met a messenger sent from the Tuscaroras
 with a few lines from their chief wishing us to come and see them, we accor
dingly did their settlement between the Oneidas and Stockbridges converst
 with one of their Chiefs Nicholas Tuisack were informed by him their
 tribe there on that settlement of was twelve families that past they originally
 were setled to the Southward, and that we think its likely they were the original
 proprietors of the Hopewell lands, concerning which our yearly meetings
 for many years were exercised with, we left them for the present & went on
 to the Oneidas where we met part of them at their Chiefs house
 lately built, its a frame weatherboarded & shingled they having
 a sawmill and it going which was built by Government which by Government the Dam broke the Dam broke at the time the Stockbridge likewise a
 Grist mill which we understood & so has been for someto be built this summer
 time is begun, After opening Counsel the lateness of the day, unfit
 ness of the Interpreter for Rendered it necessary both for them
 & us to postpone our Communications until another day
 which was agree'd to & fifth day next at 10 oClock when
 their old Interpreter Captain Jacob Read is to officiate in that Capacity 15th: This after noon we took another opportunity with the Tusca 
roras we find they have never had any portion of land measured
 them but find they consider themselves Dependants therefore unhapppy 16th: This morning we with several of the Inhabitants of the town
 accomplished a piece of Indian fence in a very short time for
 a fresh pasture for our horses, between 9 and 10 began to Rain but
 set off some afoot others on Horseback to the Oneidas according
 to appointment after some time they generally met, after some
 time they delivered us some introductory speeches, then the nature
 of our business was oppened of all of which they seemingly
 could not understand and in particular that we should bring
 them plows without oxen to Draw the Ploughs, but after
 some further explanations they seem'd better reconsited, and
 said after some time spent in their counsel in communicating 
 our business in such a manner as that they understood
 it then they made their Reply’s and that thank'd us that we took
 such a long journey from our homes that we were welcome
 in their country and that we might settle where it suited us
 signifying some that their young men were disposed to be instructed
 in the farming business & Machanick Arts, after some further
 enquiry respecting their concerns parted with in the Evening
 returned to our home Captain Hendricks Next morning the
 17th: found that our Horses had got out of their Pasture in afternoon
 an Indian man went after them got upon their track &
 found them about six miles from our Quarters making
 towards the south in an entire strange Road, at the Treaty
 with the Oneidas David Fowler came he’s one of the Peacemakers
 and Chiefs of the Brotherton settlement, he thought it was better
 for us to fix meeting them at their Town next day after tomorrowseventh day
 which was accordingly done, at Ten oClock To day we were invited to a Treaty of the Stockbridges among themselves,
 the design to reclaim a few disorderly persons that had for some 
time have had a pleasure in opposing every measure & all their
 Rules which the majority have thought right to adopt for the
 well governing their Civil & Temporal concerns, their Friends
 the Oneidas were invited hoping their Influence might have
 a beneficial effect, they likewise did attend & two of our number
 went, who informed us when they return'd, that their business
 appear'd to be unto the concerned a matter of importance and
 treated an important matter, accordingly, that some of their
 business in the manner of their transacting of it appear'd to
 be with the uncommon interesting sobriety, but to them
 that were but spectators very Humorous, then the Oneidas
 Tumilee respecting the gift of their lands to the Stockbridges
 they compar'd it a steel dish and spoon which was strong firm
 & Usefull this was in reply to the refractory party when 
 they desired a particular gift of land to them, but said they
 if we should give you Land it would be like a wooden Dish
 & spoon it would not be Usefull, but would we think
 break & split to pieces then it could not be Usefull to you
 we think in your present temper of mind land would
 not be Usefull to you that you would presently sell it
 differ about something & disagree and so split, & Break to
 pieces like the wooden Dish and Spoon then you would sell
 the land & it would then be like the wooden Dish and Spoon
 be no ways Usefull 18th: This morning set of for theBrothertown where we got about
 eleven oClock in Riding about nine miles, the road most
 of the way Excessively bad like the Road almost all the way
 from Whites Town to any each of the Indian settlements, present
ly after we came to their town they met together generally
 both Men and Women where we had not the same difficulty as
 heretofore but spoke without an Interpreter, but few of them
 understanding any other than our own language, We had a
 full open opportunity, which was a appear'd to be well received
 by most of them two of their Chiefs & Peacemakers David
 Fowler (before mentioned) and John Tuhie expressing in the
 meeting their satisfaction in seeing & hearing us, that had
 come so far to see them, several of them appear to be Religious
 sober orderly People, having a watchful care great desire
 & watchful care over these people often impressing their minds
 with by the great the need of guarding
 against Immorallity of all kinds & in an esspecial
 manner that great evil that’s so Insodental to their
 people, & had evidintaally been hurtfull in thier little
 community and if not unitedly guarded against would
 be their ruin that is the love of strong Liquor They as the Stockbridges have some disorderly walkers
 that’s seeking every opportunity to undermine their
 Government, the most mischievous among them is Elijah
 Wampa an elderly man, before their regulation
 law made by the Legislative of New-York last year
 he exercised great Authority among them, untill he
 came under bonds for his good behavior, since that
 his disturbance of the Peace consists in endeavoring
 to influence the minds of the people against the Law
 but they seem generally to favour it & quietly submit
 thereto believing thereby they shall have their Rights
 secur'd, and may enjoy Peace & Tranquillity, this Old
 man manifested thewhat spirit he was of, to Us Strangers
 the day we met them in Counsel First day 19th: they having
 before informed Us they had no Minister that preach'd
 for hire and were desirous we should set with them in
 our manner of worship, nothing appearing in our
 minds to object, we accordingly near the time which
 was Ten o’clock their time of meeting, they having
 an afternoon meeting. we went and set down with
 them and had a satisfactory meeting with them in
 the afternoon, some of our company feeling an inclination
 of setting with them in their afternoon, accordingly three
 went 20th: Part of our Company went to fort Schyler to see if Jacob
 Taylor had come with our things farming utensils, the other three spent the
 day in going to see the families at their houses, they
 Receiv'd our visit very kindly, there’s about fifty six families
 in this settlement, their lands consists of about ten thousand
 Acres lacking a few, all surveyed and divided into lots of 
 about fifty and some a hundred Acres each, those that are setted have one
 Lott, each except some few who were have been the first setters
 who they have agreed should have more, they have gathered
 from several of the Eastern States, and continue to gather
 that & when they come those lots that are not already
 Occupied are mined & such as suits the new
 comer he fixes himself upon, this Spring or last Winter
 several families have come mov'd here, these lots remain
 are to be remain unoccupied until such times as be fill'd up setted by
 such as may come from time to time. From this circumstance
 of their coming from different parts gave the name of
 the place was nam'd Brothertown. There’s considerable improvement which
 they now enjoy without their Labour having Labour'd
their having bestowing any labour for, Before the Legislatur last
 fall interfear'd they had least their lands to the White
 People who in a few years, had built houses clear'd land
 and were seated thereon, many of them had a prospect, from their
 expressions, of keeping their foothold & with great reluctance mov'd
 off by the time appointed in the Law made for regulating
 these Indians affairs, In short notwithstanding they appear
 very Poor at this time with respect to their having a sufficiency
 of Household goods and Stock of Creatures & farming utentials
 from the many Corroborating circumstances, they may become
 very good living if not a Wealthy people, their lands extraordinary good, having now
 several Lotts of Grass some containing 3, 4 & 10 & 12 acres 
 of Englishof Timothy, & some Clover mixed with the Timothy
 equal very little inferior to any we have ever seen at any place. They have an
 yearly income from the State of New York of 860 pounds
 and better, an Interest for the whole sum valuedthe State purchased upon the
 lands sold by them to governmentthe State, they having already receiv'd
 their some Cattle & are direct to purchase a considerable number
 of both Cattle & sheep so that they may have stock enough
 for their lands in a few years the greatest block in their
 having a plentifull & a comfortable living is 21st: This morning we left our friends the Brotherton
 & came to Stockbridge to our old home Hendrick Aupaumut s.
 Obediah Sepio ’s wife is David Fowler ’s daughter inform'd Us
 she had recovered from a disorder in theher Blood which which
 had grievous afflicted her for I think four years which is call'd
 the King’s evil, and after trying the skill of several Doctors, &
 many things, was told that by taking the Blood or Red Root
 and puting it Spirits might it was likely help her, that had
 been known to cure several under that desperate disorder
 which she accordingly did which had affected a cure on her
 the disorder by her relation appeared to have raged in a very desperate
 degree. 22nd: We in the afternoon met our these friends that left us on the 20th:
 to go to Scyler town who brought us word they could hear no tidings
 of Jacob Taylor & goods, which now begins to give us concern
 as the most material preparatory business to the application
 of those goods seems nearly gone through, this visit to the Oneidas
 settlement is to look about to find a suitable spot to fix our
 young men & their farm, we believing it might be best to
 settle there as they appear to be much less cultivated than the Stockbridges
 after some time spent looking about the settlement, we went to
 see the Sawmill which lies about half a mile from the main
 body of their town Houses, it appears to be a very good seat for
 mills the dam remains broke unrepaired a few hands a day
 a Couple of days might repair the Dam, but don't find
they seem as tho they had no Interest in it, the foundation for
 a Grist mill is laid & is to be built by government, from thence
 we went except one of us to view a place about 4 miles off to see whether it
 would suit for our farm which, we found to be a flat Grass
 of several hundred Acres mostly covered with a good 
 grass, & above all places that I ever saw this exceeded for Strawberrys
 here four of us Staid all night, next morning on the 23rd
 again went to the Oneida settlement when we after viewing
 the the place again we agreed upon the placea lot we believed would
 answer the our purpose, then return'd to our home Captain
 Hendricks it being the 23rd. At our return were inform'd
 the two Commissioners from Boston, (Presbyterian
 ministers) who at the request or direction of their Brethren
 of Scotland had in the forenoon held a Counsel with the
 Stockbridges & was then gone to Oneida to a Counsel
 with them. They had 24 questions in writing as how many Pagans,
 how many Indians of the nation, whether they increased or deceased
 and the rest I do not recollect, What gave rise to the
 Visit was it seems the Oneidas had made complaint in writing
 to the Society that their Kirkland did not
 preach but once in a while, that he had an £100
 a year they thought he ought to serve them faithfully
 they came to see whether the complaint was well Grounded or not Some of our company had an opportunity with them
 who said they appeared very friendly to our concern &
 told Us or one of them he wish'd us success in our under
taking that he thought we had got upon the right
 bottom to make a fair proof of what can be done
 to change their habits of Life, likewise they requested
 if we had no objection they might have a Copy of our
 Minute from the Committee they should send one to
 their Brethren in Scotland, we furnished gave them
 one, their Names 24th: held our little weekday Meeting in our Landlord’s
 Barn, in the after noon committed stated our proposi
tions in writing which respect to what we want
 the Oneida to grant that they and Ourselves things
 might be upon Certainties next morning 25th: three
 of our company went called a Counsel of theSeveral of their
 Chiefs Read them and which were Interpreted
 which seem'd to be agreeable to them, they requested
 to have them until Second day the day appointed to
 again meet them in Counsel they had them accordingly
 J. Pierse and Myself spent part of the day in Visiting the
 Sick and Aged, who Received with with marks of great friendship Acknowledging
 it a sure mark of our great friendship to them the Poor
 Indians when we had left our homes & had Rode so far
 to see them, As a mark of their friendship Gratitude one Instance
 verifies, one of the persons Women, a widow who had before invited
 us to see her sick sister had sent a present of half a
 very good lamb this morning, She has Seven Children the
 youngest about two years old & her sick Sister who had been
 so for near Two years, there is her family she appears to
 live as Comfortably as any of her neighbors, She told us she
 had ten sheep, & that she had the wool spun, & was afterward
 inform'd by their Minister she last year made fourteen
 yards of Cloth, when we were willing to pay her for the Lamb
 we had Receiv'd from her but wish'd she might kill no more
 for Us, that we wanted them the Indians to get a great
 many more Sheep so that they might make their own
 Cloathing, she said she did not propose killing any more 
 more that she should not have killed that, but she thought
 she must for us who had come so far to see them, neither
 did not want any pay for it, At several different times
 the Woman has afforded sufficient tokens of friendship their gratitude
 by their bowls of strawberries brought us— 26th: It being first day held our little meeting in our Landlord’s
 House none but our selves present – Captain Hendrick gave me an history relating to the Circumstance
 of their Nation the Stockbridges giving the Remains of the Delawares
 our Edgpelick Indians title of Grandfathers, and the Edgpelick them Grandson
 that it was from an Antient Covenant between them, that
 the Delawares in their general Counsels, had a very strong
 Voice which sunk deep in their hearts, and that they were
 apt to give advice to the other Nations, There’s one circumstance that might have been in a more
 proper place perhaps, that is with respect to the Brotherton
 People, by profession they are Baptists, they have no set preacher
 but are in the practice of holding meeting on first day twice
 in the forenoon and afternoon, when some of them either
 Men or Women speak as they feel an inclination, as they hold
 it right for Women to Speak, the day we were with them David
 Fowler & son David both spoke the father appear'd in supplication
 prayer, From our feelings we doubted their foundation being 
 upon that which was not Immovable, so we perceiv'd
 in the interval for whilst the Commissioners who were here upon the Oneidas
 Complaint, they sent one of their number Isaac Wabe 
 a young man One of their Peacemakers to propose to them
 their request them to acquaint their Brethren of the
 home fraternity that they were without a Minister that
 they would Interceed and use their endeavors to provide and send them
 a Preacher, by this piece of conduct we may readily call in question their
 foundation of standing firm & Secure, in the faith that they 
 professing to be Baptists should desire the Presbyterians
 to furnish them with a Preacher. 27th: Made ready for the Oneidas Counsel in the morning
 whilst at Breakfast a few lines was brought to us
 from a Chief of the Tuscaroras informing that we the
 Quakers must not go to the Oneidas to counsel but
 that the Oneidas would come to them at Stockbridge
 that he was desired so to do by them, so we waited with
 considerable degree of patience having experienced
 it an article very necessary in transacting business
 with these People as they seldom appear in a hurry
 and in an especial manner their Counsels, but this day
 almost exhausted all our store for the day ended & we
 heard no tidings from them — 28th: This morning
 somewhat wet or else we had concluded to have all
 went but after some time concluded to send to know
 the reason of their disappointing Us, was
 accordingly sent and after some time return'd with
 a salmon Fish in his bag, and an answer to Us that
 they had gone to Fort Stanwix to receive a part
 of their annual pay from Government & that it
 was not likely we could not have an opportunity before
 the day after tomorrow, which afresh discovers our
 necessity of multiplying our patience on this To the great Sachem and Chiefs of the State of New-York, now sitting
 around the great councill fire at New-York Brothers, Before you cover your council-fire, We beg your at
tention to the Voice of your Brethren the different Tribes living
 Oneida Country – speaks to you in remembrance of the friend
ship you have manifested toward them in all their Treaties
 We ourselves have held Counsels at different times to
 contemplate the welfare of our nations, because we cannot
 but groan to see our situation – It is also melancholy to
 reflect on the ways of our forefathers Brothers you are sometimes sorry to see the deplorable situ
ation of your Indian Brethren, for which you have
 given us many good Counsels though we feel ourselves willing
 to follow your Counsel, though we feel ourselves willing to follow your Counsel, but it has made no effect as yet
 our situation is still miserable – Our ancestors were
 Conquered immediately after you came over this Island
– By the strong heroe who does still reign among
 Indian Tribes with tyranny, -- who has rob'd us every
thing that was precious on our eyes– But we not men
tion everything particular how this Tyrant has used
 us – For your eyes have been open to behold our dismal
 Situation – By the power of our enemy our eyes have
 been blinded. – Our Young men seems become willing
 Slaves to this Despotic Heroe – so that we displeased the
 great Spirit Good spirit, and could not become Civilized
 People – in looking back we see nothing but desolation
 of our mighty men – In looking forward we see the
 desolation of our tribes – Our Chiefs has used their
 endeavors to reform their respective People but having
 seen no success they seems discouraged and hang down
 their heads. ~ Brothers – In remembrance of your kind promises We write
 our cries to you for help – Perhaps you are ready
 to think what man that must be that has abused
 so much of our Brethren – never was such Heroe or Tyrant
 heard that ever meddled with Indians
 – but in literally he is your only begotten son
 – & his name you call Rum – And the names of his
 Officers are Brandy - Wine & Gin – And we know you have power to controul him
 – And as we desire to live in peace & to become Civilized
 nations – We earnestly entreat you to use your
 power & Wisdom to prevent all people whether White
 or Black who may cause rum and other Spiritous
 liquors throughout your State to come into the hands of
 our Tribes except when sickness required our Chiefs may keep little for that purpose – For your compliance with this our request
 – We will ever acknowledge your friendship Done at the Oneida Village
 on the 15th of March
 1796 is from your Brethren

 of their land than in their Treaty they had agreed for
 that necessity required their speedy attention thereto
 however our earnestness for transacting of business, did
 not move them from their usual Deliberation, for when
 we informed them that we were desirous of meeting them
 to day they seemed to make an essay thereto, by sending
 a runner to bring them to Counsel, but after some time
 we were informed there could be no Counsel today that
 they had in Companies gone to their Corn field to hoe their
 Corn, that tomorrow they would meet us, this is the fourth

 Oneida met them about 11 O’clock, after sitting a short
 time they mentioned by the Interpreter Jacob Reed 
 that they had considered our propositions and then
 stated the Objections, which appeared to us somewhat
 reasonable, they mentioning a place for our farm
 less injurious to them, upon viewing the place con
cluded to fix our farm there, which
 we inform'd them then they appeared well pleas'd
 with our conclusions & the Counsel concluded for
 the present, we then rented a house of one of their
 Chiefs (whose mother we spoke with, her Children

 early in the morning, after rising & washed attending
 attended to the business for which I had come out
 upon and about nine o’clock, my esteem'd friend
 Joshua Evans came to my lodgings (at a Tavern
 with two other Friends, the Name of the One
 Solomon Height Dutches County Washington township living at Nine Partners & Thomas
 Almy from
 Schoharry County Dunlough township about 28 miles from
Coopers town 14 miles from Cherry Valley after my I had done with the publick
 concerns on which I had went come out upon, went with the afore
said friends set out for Brothertown settlement
 where our sd friend Joshua had a Draft in Love
 to visit them, at fort Schyler last night a House
 was Burnt down, and a child of about 6 years
 old burnt in it, it is supposed she it was set it
 on fire by by the Child consumed in the flames
 in a room. About four O’clock came to Brothertown
 and put up our horses in the pasture of George
 Crosly. Two of Us staid their myself & one
 of the other friends went to J. Tupics my Old quarters
 where we lodg'd, next this morning being the
 2nd of the month & 4th of the Week we meet with 3rd of the Month & first of the Week, having last evening inform'd
 some of People that our friend propos'd having a Meeting
 with them desiring them to give notice thereof, at the usual
 time of 10 OClock we went to th after some time our friend
 spoke in his usual plain manner with life, in the after
 noon went to their afternoon meeting, after a little time
 of silence some there appeared in some that they thought
 there a disposition to be doing something that they might
 be employ'd externally as though the Almighty could not know
 how the heart was engag'd except the Tongue express'd it
 our friend again express'd as at the former willing his
 desire for them that they might feel after that that
 worship which was inward and spiritual, and not so much
 after a formal & Outward One, when the meeting ended
 After taking our leave of them in a friendly manner
 some of them acknowledging that it was a mark of
 much love to come to see them from who were so far.
 We all AndRode to our quarters at Stockbridge altho late in after
noon, and Wet withal, likewise my own situation being
 such that I should have been willing to have staid all Night
 just before the close of the afternoon meeting felt Chilly
 had Evening as that on Sixth day evening
 last, which was for the first, which was, taken it was afore there appear'd
 a necessity for our returning this evening. John Pierse one of
 our Company & C Hendrick having information from my
 Companions on sixth day to Whitestown at their return
 to our Friends, that our friend Joshua had gone to
 Brothertown to have a meeting with them this day, They
 came to the meeting, and J.P. inform'd Us They had
 notified the Stockbridges to meet them in Counsel tomorrow
 morning at 9 OClock, we about such set came to our Old
 quarters C. Hendricks with our friends J.E. and the two
 York friends. 4th: of the Month. met the Stockbridges according to appointment.
 Read them our propositions, of what we had thought of doing
 for them, which were that we concluded to assist them in
 Building them a Grist Mill so that we would pay of the sd
 expences exclusive of what work they themselves did in
 getting the Timber and all other things they could do within
 themselves, three Doler tho of the cost, they to be at rest But if Government
 came forward to build their Mill, as in Their treaty it
 was agreed they should be done at Publick cost, then when 
ever it tothey should refund all our money back to Us
 again -- That they should have our Smiths Tools,
 that we would would give 100 Dollars to their Schoolmaster
 for Teaching one Year provided they to make up the rest
 provided he produces a testimony Signed by two of their
 Chiefs that the School had been regularly kept for the
 time,-- That we That to encourage their improvement in husbandry
 we had thought of propose giveing them a Bounty for every 12 Yds. of
 Cloth or linnen manufactured of Wooll or Flax rais'd by
 any Individual & manufactured by such an individuals Wife
 in his or her own house for every such 12 Yds one Dollar
 for every 50 Busls. of Wheat, 2 Dollars, for every 100 Busls
 of Indian Corn 2 Dollars, and for every 3 Ton of hay
 cut & put into Stack or Barn by any Individual rais'd by
 him or her in one year off of ther off of their farm 2 Dollars, provided
 he or she produce a Certificate signed by two of their Chiefs to the
 Truth
 after those offers were read by Hendrickson & Interpretted
 they were advis'd to watchfulness & care over themselves
 that they did not let their inclination to strong Liquor
 be their ruin, but those who were so weak as to gaddicted
 to be allways upon their guard and never use it at all, that
 they would should be industrious & not love to be running about
 but to stay at home & mind their own business that they
 thereby with a divine blessing would have plenty to live on
 the Great Spirit would no doubt be pleas'd with such a life
 as this & that if they did but mind that inward something
 in their own breasts that made them feel Quiet and Peaceable
 for well doing, and on the contrary for getting drunk and other Evil things
 which displeased the Great Spirit they felt sorrow &
 Disquiet in their hearts. Then after sitting a short time
 Hendrick in behalf of the his people spoke to this effect
 that they were glad of to hear our words that 
they would endeavor to mind them, That they were
 glad of the our offer to them that they believed we were
 there true Friends. But that he remembered that we
 said that after trying them for a while and there appeared
 no improvement among them that then we should be discouraged
 from giving them any more assistance, which he
 hoped might not be the case* But if they should make
 improvement they wanted to know if their Brothers
 and friends the Quakers would then continue to help
 them or no. They were answered we were in hopes
 that if they were but industrious and sober and minded our
 counsel & our friends instruction that stayed with them
 they would want but little more help from their friends
 the Counsel pretty soon broke up after this this appear'd to
 be but an artfull Query to draw from Friends a promise
 altho it might be but a slender one yet they would hold
 them bound to their engagements thereby as tho there were or had
 been the strongest covenants, so the Counsel ended. In the
 afternoon our friend Joshua had a meeting with them
 to a pretty good degree of satisfaction, having before at the
 Counsel mentioned it & the appointed time— 5th. This morning took a puke of our Indian Doctress’s
 preparing which pretty soon work'd me, that & other things
 seem'd to help me for this being my fit day it ended & felt
 nothing of it, the rest of the day was by some of us employ'd
 in preparing letters to forward to our friends, & others on
 concerns to our business. 6th: This day held the last Counsel with the Oneidas
 got there between 9 & 10, time enough to receive the Friend
 with part of our goods, after dinner rec'd the rest in a broken
 Waggon goods none damaged. Between 2 & 3 the Counsel met
 there appearing at first as tho we should be frustrated one
 of our having return'd from visiting the Interpreter J.
 Read & informed us he was so in liquor which set discoura
ging, a young man was apply'd to who came with restrictions
 by importunity by some of our company he was one of
 of their People a very Comely Genteel modest person
 who it was said could Interpret very well, but had
 not been accustomed to it, therefore modestly refused after some time the
 Old Interpreter came altho he appeared a little in
 yet we believed he was not so much as to render him
 incapable and after a little time appeared it with
 repeating & Imprinting the former agreement
 between Us and them relative to our farm &
 things relative, to the carrying it on, which was now
 drawn and signed by Us, with a request that if they
 agree'd to them that their Chiefs would do so too, which
 they accordingly did, We endeavor'd to impress their
 Chiefs with the need there was for them to be kind to
 our Young Men who stay'd with them for their good
 and to watch over their young men andthat they should
 not be abusive to them when they were in Liquor.
 If they should what a grief it would be to their parents to hear
 of any such things towards their sons, after we
 expressing what we felt on the Occasion the
 Counsel concluded & we all returned to our old
 quarters to Lodge for the last night. 7th: This morning after breakfast, took our leave of our
 Stockbridgefriends, many of them coming to take their
 leave of bid us farewell, had a solid opportunity with
 them & parted not without considerable marks of respect
 from most more particularly from the women (who had all along
 discovered it by their strawberries & other things
 for our sustenance,) went to our friends station, in order
 to take our farewell of where we came between 9 & 10 O’clock
 at our usual time we all sat down in our little meeting
 capacity to feel after, a little refreshment which some of
 were favored with I believe, then took dinner at Schonodores 
 whilst at Dinner our friend Joshua felt his mind
 drawn towards having a sitting infarewell opportunity
 with this people, there appear'd more of them Men &
 Women than we had seen together at one time before, it
 might be to bid us farewell perhaps, notwithstanding
 we seem'd to have cleared out with them Yesterday, tho not
 very satisfactorily, we thought well of his proposition, they
 were inform'd of it, and were willing, then we carried
 seats for ourselves a little distance from the House &
 sat down in the sun, Jacob Reed Interpreter who to
day was perfectly sober, they presently spread themselves
 round about us on the ground, some sitting, others lying,
 they in general sat quiet and still, during the time
 were together we most of Us had to acknowledge much
 more to our satisfaction than yesterday’s at the close day, they
 expressing their satisfaction with the opportunity partic
ly the women. Then return'd to our friends Home & got
 our Horses ready for starting, when ready took a farewell
 of our young friends with much affection, regard it being a time of
 reflection upon these lonely situation but they were then we
 mounted not without Seriously reflecting at on their
 Station and Situation. We left Oneida Castle between 3 and 4 O’clock, with our
 faces toward the western country with full expectations of
 seeing strange faces and meeting with new exercises. Road this afternoon
 12 miles and lodg'd at Jacob an Indian farmer who kept a Dram
 Shop tho it’s under the character of a Tavern, he is settled
 on the Oneida reservation nearby the out borders. Eighth, This morning started before sunrise rode
 6 ½ between 6 and 7 miles to and Breakfasted with Elijah
 Philips for several miles altho lately setted yet high
ly unproved some The Eighth this morning started before sunrise rode
 between 6 & 7 Miles to Breakfasted with Elijah
 Philips for several Miles altho lately setted yet high
ly improv'd some The Eighth this morning started before Here being
 six of these farmers setted together, having been brought up
 with the Dutch, have an experimental knowledge of
 farming business, but from our observation, their Original
 disposition & habit remains even with them, for our
 landlords wife was an Oneida bred, even for their
 habits he with considerable part himself
 being possessed of considerable share of their national
 Indhabits of indolence, he having a white man
 a Tenant, who gives him one half that’s rais'd, which
 appears chief of their subsistence. The Eight started before sunrise rode to breakfast
 6 ½ miles with at an inn, Elijah Philips keeper
 and when we had breakfasted mounted mounted & rid
 11 miles to Major Danfords where we Bated
 our horses & got some victuals ourselves, this morning
 ride altho thro a new setted country yet very considerably 
 improv'd, their improvements in grass is wonderfull.
 Timothy in a exceedingly luxuriant there appearing to
 be no little no great difference in the Height of the Wheat in the adjoining
 Lott & it, so that where we Breakfasted the man had
 considerable of his ground under such like Grass
 and said he believed they it would yield him three Tons
 to the Acre-- After we had eaten at Danfords went
 to with the Onandogos Interpreter to their settlement about
 3 miles from unfavorable Circumstance attending this
 interview, there being but few at Home having gone to
 the Lake to fish & hunt, there it appearing best to take
 this opportunity altho with but two of their Chief & a few others who
 we thought might communicate what little we had
 thought of doing for them to the Rest, the Interpreter
 seem'd so Interested for the Indians welfare made
 no' doubt but that it would be done; they appearing
 not satisfied because these we did not offer them enough
 or as much as they wish'd, for he had imbib'd an Idia
 that we proposed to bring them Oxen & from that
 notion neglected Laying out their own money for Oxen when
 received but a few months back, the Interpreters name
 Ephraim Webster . He seems very much Interested on account
 account of them for their welfare seemingly with
 a great deal of sincerity, appearing to be a man of inte
grity, he Inform'd they were so improvident as to
 Sell their Blankets which they received of Government Annually
 for Rum before they would get home, this was the 
 care of most, some few excepted, who had more prudence
 than to sell their Cloathing just as winter approaches and
 that their money they received appeared a greater
 injury than Service, that it was more frequently as
 is the saying Eaten up before they received it than otherwise
 that they have to redeem their Guns of the White
 people when received they receive their money. After our opportunity with
 them return'd and staid all Night at Danford s This morning the Eighth Ninth I got a mile on our
 way by Sunrise, Breakfasted at Moses Carpenter ’s
 15 miles, after which we rode to Henry More ’s
 12 miles who lives about two miles from the
 ferry Road over the Lake Cayuga Lake, towards
 Scipio Town, where we Bated & got our Diners
 after which went near the settlement of the Cayuga’s
 5 miles to Frederick Geerhearts. This morning
 for about nine mile we rode on the Onondago
 reservatio sold to Government last year, Surveyors
 employ'd now in dividing it into Plantations Lotts
 the rest of the way, except near Geerhearts on the
 Military Lands, very little improv'd but
 very little improv'd, mostly in the hands of
 Land Jobers who purchased them of the
 poor Soldiers, pretty much at the same rate the
 public Securities were purchased of them even at a
 very inconsiderable price - We were inform'd that
 there were but of very few of the Original who retain'd their
 Lands. We found the Cayuga’s settlement was about
 two & an half Miles from the place we now are were at, at
 our request, Frederick went with us to their Settlement
 & to the Wigwam of a young couple the man an Oneida
 his wife of the Stockbridge his name John Jourden 
 They who said they spoke pretty good English, his having the
 language so well was the reason of his being among them
 as an Interpreter for them having their Language
 likewise. We mentioned to him our business he understood and define of having
 them together in a few hours, but he inform'd us they
 were gone a Hunting & could not come be got together before
 tomorrow about ten O’clock, which would disconcerted our plan
 very much intending to have moved forward toward 
Canadaqua after the Op when our business was gone
 through with them, there were a few of them at home
 however therefore had them summoned together, but there
 when together there number being so inconsiderable that
 it could not be satisfactory nor best to go into the business
 with them at this time, & tomorrow being first day we could
 not fully approve of Meeting them on business then, least
 the people round about might take occasion to vilify Us.
 Under these several considerations concluded to stay in the
 place & meetfor them to meet Us about sunrise Second
 day morning. Left them they were to send for the rest
 that we might see them all together, then Left them and
 returned to our Pilot’s to his house where we proposed to him
 & wife if they were free, of staying till we had the proposed our
 opportunity with the Indians they seemed free - When we
 found we were like to stay in the neighborhood tomorrow
 our friend Joshua proposed before we left the Indians of
 having a meeting with them in the afternoon & let them
 know it desiring that they would acquaint all
 their People thereof, When we returned several of the neighbors
 were there, acquainted them of our meeting tomorrow
 morning at our Quarters, our Landlords & Wife’s liberty having
 been previously gotten, they having liv'd at Great Valley
 in Pennsylvania untill about seven years ago then
 Pack'd up their alls having & three Children one Daughter married who with their family also without
 ever seeing the place till they came, the Indians
 gave them the liberty of setting on their land at
 that time it was There’s last fall it where he now lives
 but last fall it was purchased with it it’s in that
 part purchased by Government last fall, but he is to
 keep his title improvements by paying the everidge price of those lands
 when sold~ Tenth of the month and first of the week, at the time
 appointed several of the neighbors came, & set down
 with us in silence under the shade of a Tree to a good
 degree of satisfaction. One of the neighboring women
 informed us she had been brought up in the Neighborhood
 of Friends on Rhode Island that her Husband was a
 had been a member of our Society that his Parents
 were now members, they had liv'd in this neighbor
 place about four years, that he was now gone to
 the Westward and had not yet returned. Her heart seem'd much
 affected, & seem'd under concern because she knew not where
 her lot would be cast, expressing her satisfaction if there
 was but a meeting near her, at parting she desired our company at her
 house, if we could but, expressing her the satisfaction it would
 be to her. We near the time appointed went to attend
 the appointed meeting with the Indians, when we got
 there sat down with the company of our Landlord & a few
 others that was at the meeting at his house in the morning, which
 ended without the Company of any of our Indian
 Brethen friends oh not an individual attended. Even the
 interpreter abseanted himself which we thought more singular manifested
 there a singular indifference toward Us as he had, had a
 Colledge Breeding we understood. After a short time in
 sitting together we went to our quarters~ Eleventh, Showery morning which was acceptable
 it now having had the appearance of a Drowth, there having
 fell but little Rain since we came into the Indian
 Country. got Breakfast and setted with our landlord for
 the time of our Quartering with him, who seem'd much
 more moderate in his Charges than most of the places
 were where we partook of their provision, he & Wife
 making Us heartily treating us with Civility & Respect
 finishing with the best they had & that very good, she
 having received her instruction education near Philadelphia
 is not to be so much marveled at. After which we Bid our
 host and family farewell. Rode to the Indian Interpreter’s, the
 place appointed, they having not as yet come neither were
 many more expected than these were on Seventh day when
 we left them, after some time there sachem 
 one Chief & one Warrior, with four of their women which made
 up the Counsel, they inform'd us that whatever proposition we
 made them should be delivered to the rest, so that they were willing
 to receive what we had to say, We found them pretty much in
 the same situation with the Onondagos, treated them made
 them nearly the same offers, which they said they were glad to
 hear from Us and should in the fall send some of their Boys to
 us to school. Besides Educating and learning several of their
 lads trades, we told both these and the Onondagos, they should
 have some axes & hoes sent them in the Spring, their situations
 are very similar as to subsistence having their whole dependence
 on Wild game and fish both are very plenty, these last have
 the advantage of the others there so being so near the Lake
 their huts standing near the brink, at any time they
 go out may in a short time take a dozen or two of very
 large fat eels, much fatter in the opinion of such of the
 Company as had been acquainted with this kind of fish
 than they had ever seen before, as well as much larger; they
 take them with the spear, and so they do the Pike which
 which is also of a superior size, between 3 & 4 feet in
 length, to weigh near 20 weight. We now left them
 2 ½ miles from our Quarters, to their Castle from thence to 
 7 Miles more to the ferry rode near the lake, land of a very different kind
 from the county in general having a Barren appearance, the timber almost
 altogether white oak, the Timber short trees low, and not as
 we got to the ferry and in the turn we took to the Indian 
 settlement from M. Carpenters where we breakfasted. Rode about
 twenty seven and an half Miles when if we had kept
 the common road we should not have rode no more than
 Twenty. ThereforeAt this ferry the keeper John Harris from
 Harrisburg in Pennsylvania, we found a very convenient boat in which
 the ferryman said he had carried thirty head of Cattle
 at a time. There was seven of Us in Company with Horses
 who all got into the wind being fair we were just twenty
 Minutes by my watch from the time we started from
 one shore untill we got out on the opposite one the distance
 by measurement we were inform'd had been taken when
 the waters were frozen one & a quarter miles & some
 perch. Now on this shore we met with another Pennsylvan
ian of the name of James Bennit near Harrisburg his wife of
 the family of the Richardsons who were at the Valley forge have
 been settled here six years. This ferry appears to be a place
 of much business as its the alone passage by land to the Western
 country, the lake forty miles in length & in some places
 four in Breadth. Here we Bated our horses on hay &
 got dinner, having in our company the Post who
 rides from Whites town to Canadockway thought it best
 to keep his Company notwithstanding it rain'd, having
 began since our getting over the ferry, he proposing reach
ing Geneva this afternoon which should was in distance
 fourteen miles; therefore mounted our horses in the rain and
 as we rode the rain increased so that it may be said we
 had indeed a very Rainy Ride all the way till we got
 to port. This land between the two lakes call'd the Military Tract unsettled except a
 very few new beginnings, of a good fertile appearance Timbered
 not unlike our best land the land in our Country of the best
 Quallity 
 quallity with Black Oak, White Oak, Hickory in places likewise Beech,
 maple, ash, not so lofty as it hath been in many other parts
 we have of this county we rode thro, at Geneva we stayed all
 night. This place it seems takes its name from a town in
 Switzerland which it resembles, standing at the north West
 corner of the Lake which is said to be forty
 miles long, two miles short of the Cayuga is the Head or Upper extent of the Water
 communication from Albany into this country from
 Albany up the Mohawk. It’s a very pretty situation on the
 banks of the lake several well looking Buildings of 
 Houses and Stores put up & more going up there it’s believ'd
 that it will be a place of considerable trade here we saw
 a Vessel upon the Stocks it was said to be a Shallop, to be kept
 employ'd in trading on this Lake there being a town at the
 upper end of it which they call Catherene’s Town Twelfth this morning rainy. Did not start untill we
 had our Breakfast then the rain abated, prepared for
 moving by this time it cleared away, the post still our guide. We had a pretty comfortable
 ride much more so than we expected from the representation
 we received of this part of the Road, whenever it became the
 subject of conversation being represented as Intolerable
 the dry weather having been much in our favor in this
 respect as in many others, this morning’s ride to Canandaigua
 which is said to be tho we Rode a new road which is suppos'd to be much more than
 16 miles, This lake is said to be 24 Miles in
 length. We don’t find this off from This town situated as Geneva lying
 near the brink of the Water but pass by the Lake &
 on rising ground from the Lake nearly half a mile in the
 town several showey Houses, frame buildings and painted 
 White. They have laid out a Six Rod Road from the Lake
 for a considerable distance back, by which the buildings
 the Houses stand; there’s now 25 frame besides several log houses Erected, here
 stands their Courthouse. This is called Ontario County.
 having put up at a public house & got Dinner, went to
 Israel Chaping’s to learn whether the Indians further
 West were dispos'd to receive friends offers. We find him
 not to live in Opulence not even equal to what we had
 expected, but he has a appears a sober discreet well behaved
 person & informed Us that Indians generally favor'd our
 Offers; Cornplanter was the only tribe who favored our settling with them as 
 after after a short opportunity, concluded we would
 leave this business for a few days and recruit our selves
 among our friends at Mud Creek & Horses in Company with our friend Joshua Evans (who
 now had now come to the end of his Journey, (having now
 come to us again he having found Just at our first coming to
 the Lake about three miles back had found one of those
 friends he came to this Country to see his name
 William Ingle ) we mounted our Horses for Mudd Creek
 having for our pilot Jared Comstock who was in Town, son of Nathan Comstock 
 The place where we propos'd going to in about five miles on the
 way parted, J.P. & I.R. went to Jacob Smith ’s the
 other three of Us kept with our Pilot & in five miles more
 got to his father’s after Riding from Canadarkway
 10 miles & nearly as bad road as we have found in this Country. Thirteenth. After breakfast, the friend Jared Comstock our Pilot walk'd
 with Us to Abraham Lapham ’s about three miles distance
 where we was kindly received by himself & wife as we were
 at the friends where we staid last Night who land Here we find five families of our wandering seated with wanderedfriends
 seated on in what was seven years
 ago a Wilderness, four hundred miles from their native
 homes & their kindred, 
 in Boston or Massachusetts state, on land of a
 superior kind, having now, fields of Indian Corn, Wheat,
 Grass, Buildings where they seem to enjoy a plenty of
 the things of Life in a plain Homespun manner; their
 land seems wonderfully adapted to Indian Corn & Grass. They take
 a piece of their lofty timbered land in the winter &
 spring, along Cut the Timber off by the first of the Fifth Month
 when they with the Hoe only without any other Operration
 put the corn in about three feet each way, the Customary
 of the Corn way of planting in distance of planting their Corn, this seems to be the
 main part of the Labour for a Crop, then cut up some few
 weeds that comes up among the Corn, rarely doing any
 more to it, not even hilling itself, till the Crop comes
 to perfection; this practice was performed to a field of
 nearly ten acres of Nathan Comstock which in the
 fall last was cloth'd with living timber now is in
 a beautiful field of Corn planted after the twentyeth
 of the fifth Month, their corn yealds them from twenty
 to forty bushels to the Acre by their information. In this
 settlement is many more families professers with friends from the
 same place and places adjacent. This Country is divided
 in Countys, the Counties in to townships of six miles 23040 acres, these
 Townships in to lots of 320 Acres each numbered so many lots seven
 years ago last fall the purchase of this Township was
 for 1152 pounds, now one of these lots will sell 
 or hath been sold for £1600 which serves to show the rapid
 increase of this Country. Fourteenth our friend J. Evans had a meeting at Nathan
 Comstocks having before inform'd friends they the Neighbors
 at or near the time they met & had a favor'd opportunity at
 the close intimated he had desired them who were or had
 disown'd or stood so, with those who are members, which was Fourteenth our friend Joshua Evans mentioning his a mind, of having
 a meeting at the place we were at N. Comstock ’s, there being
 information thereof given to friends and Neighbors, who met
 (and our friend had an open time among opportunity with them, at the
 close of the after which he mentioned a desire of an he had
 some few of having an opportunity with those who were mem
bers in company with together with such as stood disown'd.
 They accordingly collected into a together when he their
 state & situation seem'd to be opened pretty clearly, setting
 before them the great danger, without living near to that divine
 principal within them of their becoming a Reproach to the
 Name they made profession of, the condition of their Children
 for want of the Hedge of the Discipline kept up around
 them by the way would go of into Irregularities and Immoralities
 and thereby suffer great loss, and for want of this Hedge which
 has such a tendency of Keeping sweet and Clean, there would be a
 falling into one thing after another to the great grief of such
 among them as beheld the great beauty there was in holiness
 endeavoring to impress their minds with the absolute necessity of
 feeling deeply by after help, & that their they might have their eyes might
 be opened, if this come to be the case they could not become
 content short of a reconciliation with their friends again that
 which would much contribute to their welfare, with their
 their own endeavors, to maintain the truths of the
 Gospel, in a Pious Godly Life, by this they might become
 bright shining lights in this place, and be as Salt
 having a good savor among the People. It appear'd a
 time of deep thoughtfulness to many minds, that and
 cannot but believe there are a considerable number who
 are under concern on account of their dangerous situation
 who are well concern'd friends. After noon return'd to
 Canadarkway to meet our Company likewise met
 with them at Israel Chapin ’s where we took Tea and
 after some further information from him respecting our Business
 further West, returned to the Tavern where we yesterday
 put up Dudly’s to~ There seems a doubt in some of our minds whether there’s
 necessity of going further west or returning homewards, not
 having received answers to the Queries, to the different tribes
 last spring that they have that they are desirous we should
 assist them in the way propos'd in the Queries, except
 Cornplanter who with a few others who incline to his counsel is we are inform'd requests
 Friends’ assistance, this circumstance turning up as we
 so that we postpone the resulting untill some future
 time bearing the subject weighing it in our minds
 until, we may be nearly ready for a move forward, in
 there being need of two or three days detention in this place
 on several accounts~ Fifteenth, this day chiefly taken up in getting our Horses
 shoes examined & shod for which we had to pay fourteen
 shilling for shoeing a Horse Round, towards evening
 J. Pierce and I. Rowland went to their former home toward at
 Mud Creek, Jacob Smith ’s, having a mind to be at the
 meeting tomorrow appointed by our friend J.E. the other
 two J.S. & my self stay'd at oun retired Public House, having
 had every little interruption from Crowds of Company which
 on some accounts made the place agreeable, but the reason
 why it was so made an dispos'd Us to seek a new one, their
 poor provision & inattention (which we were witnesses
 unto) as from information was the Occasion of our happening
 with respect to the little company at this place, however
 our horses could not be done before Evening
 made our stay here one Nightmare. Sixteenth took breakfast with at with our landladys,
 which was on very bad made Coffee and Toast without Butter
 or Cheese having neither, after which prepar'd for a move for new Quarters.
 Settled the Bill and for this Breakfast paid 2/0, then mounted
 our horses & rode to William Ingle s the place where we left
 J.E. and we went on our way to Canadarque, where we were
 kindly received by him & Wife, being glad as they said
 when they met with any from near Philadelphia
 the Woman a member of all their Children which
 is seven, the Man disowned for some transaction in the
 difficultys during the Commotions when friends 
 in this Land respecting War when many more were set and still stands as he now does Since my being among these people in their settlement
 have felt an exercise on my mind on their Truths
 as well as their account; many of their Wif Wives
 and more of their Children having an actual Right
 in society they all up taking
 here they be without any outward Helps, nothing more
 likely than for them to fall into Irregularities of one
 kind or another, till they bring Reproach on themselves Still, under all such Immoralities let it be ever so Heinous to
 in the Eyes of all Sober people of whatever denomination
 yet still they are members, and are distinguished from
 other denominations of the place by Quakers, to the very
 great reproach of the Holy profession of the Truth which
 we hold forth to the World that I do verily believe it’s a
 matter which does deeply concern Society least they become
 a Blemish and Spot in the Church, and instead of
 becoming Lights to the people of the place where they are planted in will
 be as Blocks & hindrences in the way of such who are
 of enquiring minds after the way to Truth & Peace
 as I make no doubt there be such in this place, as well
 as in most others, That they may be helped with a little
 with a little help is the very great desire of my mind.
 There we staid all Night, with with to be at a meeting
 our friend J. E. Appointed here tomorrow. Seventeenth we had a satisfactory meeting this morning, most of
 neighboring people came and sat Commendably still and quiet
 several came from the Town, as our said friend came through town
 his company Abraham Lapham invited to said meeting, they
 seem'd to admire that it had not been held in town some of
 whom were the principal people of the place, offering the
 Court House if he would appoint a meeting in the afternoon
 which they seem'd desirous of. Our friend seem'd to incline
 so to do & accordingly notice was given & four o’clock the time
 appointed to meet. Near the the time several of our friends
 went in company with our said friends to the meeting
 who said it was to their satisfaction, a considerable number
 of the people attending of the town attending. There’s not any
 meeting of any denomination near this place. Eighteenth, This 
 7th Month 19th Started from CanadarkwayLodg'd at
 last Night Canadadarkway with our faces
 set Homeward, breakfasted at our friend William
 Engles two miles from Town then from thence
 20 miles to the Head of the Lake where we Dined
 at Thence to
 6 miles but thinking we might reach some further rode
 3 miles and staid at Hookers all
 Night where our horses fair'd poorly if we had but
 staid at the other stage three miles short, horses
 might faired pretty well. Twentieth rose by the time it was
 well Light prepar'd and mounted rode to Bath
 20 miles, here is several cross'd the 
 three times on which this settlement is, whatever
 inducement of the founder of this town is a
 secret to us, why it should be on so extreme
 unfertile a Soil, equal to the meanness of our
 Gloucester Pine Land for several miles distance
 to be sure yet there’s a narrow strip of middling good
 Bottom near the Brook on each side, but in our
 opinion no ways to compare with the greater
 part of the Bottom land in general here’s
 several good well looking Frame Houses, our Stage
 John Madcalf Public House, here we took
 Breakfast & Dinner in the same Meal between
 eleven & twelve, again mounted, in about one Mile
 distance stopp'd at William Kersey ’s, who about
 two month since came to this place with his wife and family to the Place
 friend who a few years ago was in good esteem, he acts in
 the capacity of surveyor and sits in the seat as second
 judge of the courts, lives in a very small log
 House at near the brink of a small Lake, appearing to us
 very singular, were told its half a mile from one shore
 to the Opposite one, nearly bound, that in some parts
 had been fathomed to the depth of 40 Fathom without
 reaching bottom, no visible streams in nor out
 of it multitudes of fish of various kinds some to be seen
 in deep water of a large kind; lands round about Laid
 out 12 Acre lots as tho navagible water stream a short
 distance from this William son in about Building
 his House to reside live in, its cause of admiration to see
 the Choice of this Wise Rich Man, who having such
 an extent of excellent Land, yet make choice of so extreme
 poor soil to seat himself on spot, this in the
 the county town, from hence we went to the Painted Post
 18 miles, went two miles East of this place to a little town
 to lodg this afternoons ride most of the way on a Soil

 Patterson in this Town three stores & Post Office
 kept, Past rides to here had very good accommodation for
 selves & Horses Twenty first, started pretty early and Cross'd the 
 at the Painted Post rode by the Tioga in the water of which
 we saw a large flock of Ducks, they forc'd up the stream 
 faster than our common Gate had to hasten very
 much to pass them after which stopt in full view near
 the water edge they still remaining in the water
 14 miles we rode this morning to Breakfast at the

 far Twenty second this day got in early, took supper early

 start in the morning having a very disagreeable tedious
 Journey in view tomorrow agreeable to the representation
 from all who knew anything about it we having
 prevailed upon our this nights landlord to go with us and be pilot partly from importunity, partly on inclination
 and considerably upon our prosess of rewarding him

 Travellers subsistence, except meat to bring thro
 this Wilderness on Horseback, the Moon a little
 after its full, at twelve o’clock rise & half past

 part of our journey prety good which suited our
 the heavy Drowsy disposition we were in half
 past five in the afternoon came to James Thomson s

 more, Bated three times in this days ride the subsistence we
 and our Horses had this rout through we procured at
 the Widows Lindsley, yesterday, second time Bated
 at Anthony Sons twenty five miles from where we
 started in the morning at a very suitable stage in point of distance
 but in every other way miserable, having neither food
 for Man nor Horse, of an Infamous character & of such a
 nature that Travellers dreads the making a night stage
 of this place having reports on both sides that he’s both
 a murderer & Robber. By the time we got to Thomp
sonsboth our selves and Horses were thoroughly fatigued
 not having seen any other house but the sd house
 until we came within about three miles of our
 Quarters, it’s call'd the Wilderness for twenty miles
 of the way mountainous part very stony, other parts
 very Miry on greater part of the way has
 an appearance nearly alike much of the Land
 we have pass'd through in the Neighboring
 Country would do well to be settled upon settle on. The
 Top of this Mountain pretty levil until we came
 near the decent, where we have when we
 descend very fast for between some more than a
 Mile, while at the Top & in the decent saw Vapor
 Vapors rising and became Clouds
 below the Tops of the Mountains. Twenty third, Did not rise very early, examining our
 Horses found mine the back swollen, so that it would
 not be safe to Ride it, therefore concluded to clothe
 her only with the saddle & other appurtenances & I
 too take it a foot to our friends at Munsey which
 was about twenty miles, we thought it right now
 to part J.L. went concluded to go with our friend
 J.E. Likewise our Pilot still continuing their Pilot
 before we seperated made him a rewarded
 him with better than four Dollars, then we con
cluded we were great gainers, without him we
 should have been in continual Anxiety about

 House. I having walk'd cheaf chief of the way the other two
 spelling me by turns came this morning
 20 miles, this morning crossed the Lycomming

 Waters a little above where the two waters unite. We here on the south side of the Wilderness find
 there harvest for the most part gathered, with all
 a wet harvest, whilst on the North Harvest
 not no Grain Harvested season very dry Here we heard of singular circumstance of
 Person a Frenchman who was 
 on third day last about fording the Waters
 of the Loyalsock about twenty above the fork
 when his horse rear'd fell back upon his Rider
 near a Ripple Shortly was carried into a
 deep hole where an eddy drew him
 under, and among Trash of Timber lying under
 Water, notwithstanding the earliest search made
 by the person where he lodg'd having but just
 before at the brink of the water parted and return
ing home from the water. in his own country He appears to be a Person
 of considerable note, also of large very exten
sive property, having here, having Wife &
 family at Germantown or in that neighborhood. Also another feeling account of 
 an Englishman a Friend who
 last Winter thought in time of snow on the ground
 would take his Gun & go out to try if he could
 not kill a Deer not intending as he said of
 staying longer than three or four hours, took
 three Dogs, his Company, pretty soon found him
self bewildered, when he wandered for four days
 & three Nights in which time wore his shoes out

 Extreme Necessity roasted some and eat of it
 wandering until had no more ability left
 in him then laid prepared himself for Death, when
 his neighbors who were in search of him
