 Some account of my residence among
 the Indians Continued -- 3rd Mo the 1st The weather very
 Cold and Snow near three feet deep
 In the last month the Indians generally
 collected to Cornplanters Town to perform
 their Yearly sacrifice where the continued
 near twenty days with their usual parade
 of dancing musick and feasting, and such was
 their zeal to have their people generally
 collected that a certain lame man whom
 we had instructing in school learning
 the drag'd on Deer skins to the Lower village
 and an old lame man unable to travel the
 drew 13 or 14 miles in the same manner -- At this time they had much counseling
 about appointing some young Chiefs
 but could not agree generally in their
 Choice -- At the Indians request the 2nd of this
 month I went to Cornplanters village
 in order to write something which they
 wish'd to keep in remembrance and on
 my arival they people were generally 
 collectd together when I found the writeing
 they wanted done was a speech which Corn-plan
 ters Brother was going to make respecting what
 (he saith) he had seen in a trance some time
 before, which I would willingly have evaded write
 ing but could not without giveing offence to the
 Indians which I though best to avoid at that time. The old man related several strange things
 which he said was shown unto him, all which
 I wrote but shall avoid inserting here - and after
 the whole was related they desired me to tell them
 my opinion of it and whether I thought
 it was true -- But I told them I had, had but
 little time to think about it and could not
 tell, and therefore avoided giveing them an
 answer at that time -- Then the Council
 ended and next day I return'd home -- 29th of the month By a certain Francis
 King who was setled on the waters of
 this River about 60 miles above us we received
 a number of Letters from Philadelphia
 and also from our relations in the
 adjacent parts which after a long winter
 in which we had receivd but little informa
 tion from them was truly satisfactory We also got intelligence from the committee 
 on Indian affairs which informd us that the
 two Young Men - (Jacob Taylor and Jonathan Thomas )
 who had been residenters at the Onieda settlement
 did not appear releast from further service among
 the Indians and that there was some expec-
 tation of them comeing to spend some time at
 our settlement which was encourageing and
 comfortable intelligence to me as I had for
 several months past had a prospect of being
 releast from the present engagement the
 ensuing summer, haveing inform'd the
 Committee on Indian affairs thereof
 accordingly -- 5th month the 4th Receivd a letter from
 my Father in which he express much
 desire for my return before the ensuing
 Harvest if the way should open for it, men
 tioning his bodily infirmities were much
 encreased so as to render him incapable
 of takeing the necessary care of his concerns
 which created a little anxiety in my mind
 on his account as the prospect of my get-
 ting away that soon was somewhat uncertain
 no certain accounts haveing yet arived of
 others comeing forward to keep up the
 settlement at this place -- About this time Cornplanter and a member
 of his people went to Buffalo Creek to receive their
 yearly annuity from Goverment at which
 place a general Council of the Seneca Nation was
 held where the Superintendant of Indian affairs
 Attended -- On their return Corn-planter 
 requested us to attend at their Village when
 the collected to divide their money which we
 did accordingly the 8th of this month, Corn-
 planter then informd us of their proceeding
 at the Late Counsel at Buffalo Creek and of
 the disunity that was like to take place
 among the different tribes -- also gave us a
 sorrowful account of a Murder that was com-
 mitted at that place during his stay there,
 by an Indian who lived in the Genesee
 Countrey. -- In the house of Wm. Johnson 
 a Negro Man was playing with a Child
 that was runing about the Floor - The Indian
 comeing in said to him You are a Negro, you
 have no business here, do you go away -- but
 the poor Black man little thinking his
 doom was so near paid little attention to him
 but being told the Indian had a knife in
 his hand he flew back to the wall, &
 the Indian without any further provocation 
 immediately pursued him and stab'd him
 throw the heart so that he expird in a few minutes
 The murderer stay'd about and saw him expire
 without any appearance of conviction or dismay
 and was not apprehended at that time tho
 numbers of White people were present -- While we were speaking with Cornplanter 
 a member came in to tell him of another murder
 that was committed a few days before among
 his own people -- Two Indians that were brothers
 being down the River about Stump Creek a hunt-
 ing differed between themselves and the oldest kill'd
 the younger -- This latter appear'd to be the dread
 ful efforts of strong drink that great engine of
 Human wretchedness which too many alas that
 are called Christians are earnestly contending for
 the use of notwithstanding the dismal effects it
 produces in almost every quarter of the land and
 more particularly among these poor Ignorant
 inhabitants of the wilderness -- These affecting
 Circumstances and many others produced by
 the use of Spiritous Liquors together with some
 occurrences that took place during the late
 Council at Buffalo Creek caused Corn-plan
 ter to write to Congress on the Occasion -- After the Indians had divided their money 
 which amounted to three dollars a Soul they call'd
 us into the house and inform'd us that the had
 reserv'd a little for us -- Observeing that we had
 now been a great while among them trying to do
 them good and had given them a great deal, &
 said they knew we were not in the way of hunt-
 ing to get meat as they did, that we had to buy
 Skins to make ourselves Mokinsons, and that
 it was very hard if they should never give us
 any thing to help us to get our liveing -- We replied the offer was very kind of
 them but that we did not stand in need
 of any assistance - that we came among them
 to do them good and try to learn them the
 good ways of the White people, and that we
 often had told them we wanted nothing
 from them for all our trouble, but when
 we stood in need of any money to buy provisions
 our friends gave it to us, that we did not
 depend on the forrests for meat but killd
 the Pig and the Cow, and that many of
 the Indians was very kind to us when
 they killd plenty of meat they often gave
 us share -- Corn-planter then observ'd we had but 
 one Cow to give us milk, and that it was hard
 we had not plenty of Milk that we might
 go and buy ourselves another good Cow, and insisted
 upon us takeing the money, which as it was
 given as a present from the Indians we accepted
 though with much reluctance, but concluded to give
 them the value of it in something else that would
 be of as much use to them -- The 25th of this month in the morning arived
 our friends Jacob Taylor and Jonathan Thomas 
 whom we had some expectation of for several
 weeks past -- Their arival to me was glad
 tideings of much Joy, as I had since receiving
 the last letter from my father some expect
 Anxiety to hear of some comeing forward to
 unite in endeavouring to promote the welfare
 of the Natives in this Quarter - but now the
 Addition of two valuable experienced friends
 caused those anxieties to subside and the way
 appeard to open with considerable Clearness
 for me to look towards my native land
 with gladening Sensations which appear'd to
 mingle with the expectations and desires of
 some of my relations and concern'd friend who
 visited me with several acceptable letters by
 the late oppertunity -- 6 mo the 2nd Went down to the lower Village
 with Jacob Taylor and Jonathan Thomas , Corn
 planter and a number of his people being gone to
 Pittsburgh prevented us from haveing an interview
 with the Indians to inform them generally of
 the intentions of our newly come friends but
 the few that were at home appeard respectful
 and glad to see them -- 8th of the month An express came from
 the Cataraugus Indians that the Millwrights
 were ariv'd at Buffalo Creek who had undertaken
 to build their Saw Mill and was therefore desirous
 that some of us might go over and give them
 a little assistance in planing the business, as
 they had such a Grant from Jacob Taylor and
 Jonathan Thomas if call'd upon -- Altho, I was
 only waiting for the Indians return from Pitts
 burgh to take leave of this place and return to
 my native land, this intelligence from Cataraugus
 reviv'd some desires to Which before had
 to town see that place, again before I left the Countrey &
 therefore Jacob Taylor and myself concluded
 to set forward next morning on the Journey. 9th Accordingly set out about 8 Oclock and
 rode thro' the woods till near sundown, came
 to the Delaware Indians hunting Camp found 
 a fire ready kindled and rested comfortably
 beside it till morning -- 9st Set forward on our way and reach'd the
 Neighbourhood of Cataraugus about noon, and
 spent sometime in exploreing a Stream of
 water a little east of the Delaware vilage on which
 we thought a favourable situation might be had
 for a sawmill, and where was some open plains
 I had not before seen the most delightful for cul-
 -tivation of any I had ever seen being extensive
 fertile flats surrounded with beautiful groves
 of White Oak White Pine & sugar Maple -- And
 a pretty stream flowing thro' the Midst thereof
 furnishing abundant oppertunities for settlements
 on either side -- We then rode down to the Seneca
 village and went to the Chief Warriors house who was
 not at home but his wife treated us with much
 hospitallity and manifested her hearty good will
 will towards us by furnishing us with the best
 accommodations she could afford -- The Mill
 wrights we understood was ariv'd and gone to the
 propos'd place for building the sawmill which was
 on the south side of the River near a mile above
 the Village -- After refreshing ourselves the
 Chiefs wife and several others accompanied us
 to the place whe the Millwrights had begun to work 
 The situation was very beautifull for the purpose
 but the stream we thought was rather smal &
 several of the Indians express'd their fears about it.
 And seem'd desirours we should take a review of
 the other Stream which we attended to the next
 day in company with the Millwrights and were
 still of the mind a good mill seat might be had
 at that place but the Mill wrights seem'd to throw
 several Obstacles in the way, and persisted in going on
 with the work where the had begun and the Indians
 conclueding the other stream might answer their pur-
 pose tho' it would not saw all the year, we found
 best to leave the Matter pretty much to them
 selves, yet the return'd us many thanks for our
 care in comeing to advise them -- This evening we mentioned to some of their Chiefs
 that we propos'd going home to morrow & should
 like to see a few of them collected together next
 morning to take leave of them before we departed.
 They replied they had thought of the same
 thing and would be happy to speak a few words
 with them us before we went away -- 12th of the month Accordingly this forenoon
 the chiefs and others collected and call'd us into
 the Counsel room where we had some further
 conversation about the sawmill with which the 
 appear'd satisfied -- I also thought proper to inform
 them that I was now about to leave the Indian
 Country and go home to any friends, that I had been
 very happy in liveing this thwo years among their
 Brethren on the Allegany River endeavouring to be
 useful to them, and that I felt so much regard for them
 as to come and see them before I left their Countrey
 that I was well pleas'd in viewing their Land and
 glad the had reserv'd such a fine piece of Land to
 live upon, and was desirous they might use all
 endeavours to cultivate this Land that they might
 came to enjoy plenty to live upon -- also that I
 heard of their resolutions to quit the use of Strong
 drink, and hoped they might be strong in them
 so as to gain a victory -- After some further re-
 marks the Young war Chief (who appears to be
 a man of an active understanding) made a reply
 that he was thankful the Great Spirit above
 had preseved such a fine day for us to meet together
 and that we appear'd to be of one mind -- And
 then repeated a Speech nearly in substance
 to what he had delivered to Jacob Taylor &
 Jonathan Thomas about two weeks before, which
 which was as follows "We feel happy to see you
 arive at our Town & thank the great Spirit
 for preserveing you safe on the Journey as if 
 he had appointed this day for us to meet together -
 We call you Brothers because you are willing to instruct
 us and we thank you for takeing the pains
 to call to see us - we now want to enquire of
 you concerning a speech we sent down to Philadel-
 phia last winter to our friends - Quakers - we
 have had a great deal of difficulty about the sale
 of our lands, and much counseling together have
 got this piece reserved for ourselves to live upon -
 we have looked round on every side to see if
 there was any people that regarded the good
 Spirit so much as to deal Justly and honestly
 with us - we heard of the Quakers that they
 were honest and might be depended on, & we
 unanimously agreed in counsel to apply to
 them for assistance and instruction, and in
 the first place requested them to furnish us with
 a set of Sawmill Irons which they have kindly
 granted and sent forward -- we often consider
 our wild situation and sometimes think we
 are too wild to become a civilized people, but
 we have come to a resolution to try all we
 can, and now their is not any body can
 charge the people of this Town with doing any
 damage or Mischief neither has there been 
 one shilling of our annuity kept back on account
 of the misconduct of our warriors -- we are deter-
 mined to persevere in the resolutions we have formed
 and altho' we may not yet make much progress in
 this way yet we look forward to our Children and think
 the instruction of our friends Quakers will have a
 lasting good effect on them -- we therefore think
 our friends may afford us assistance as the see
 encouragement and according as our conduct deserves." This was in substance repeated to us at this
 time and the Young Chief also made some
 further observations desireing that I might tell
 their Old friends the Quakers when I went home
 that they were exceedinly thankful for the
 kindnesses shewn them and the assistance we
 had already given them that they were now
 determined to follow our advice as far as they were
 Able, and to spill all the Whisky that traders
 should bring among them for sale -- & that we
 must not think they were offended at us try
 ing to make them sensible of their weaknesses
 for even their young men & young women
 rejoiced to hear it and were in hopes their
 hands would grow stronger that they might
 be enabled to gain the victory -- 
 Also that they were determined to try to help
 themselves and lay up money to purchase
 useful articles to go to farming with for the pitied
 their poor women and saw it was too hard for them
 to do all their Labour and work out in the hot sun.
 and altho the could not ask any more favours
 of us - they were desirous we should remember
 them, and as we saw on knew their poor situation
 they would leave it to ourselves to do whatsoever
 we thought best for them, but one thing in
 particular (they said) we desire you to remem-
 ber that we are a poor Ignorant people and for
 want of Learning, in the course of our dealings
 with the white people have been greatly wronged
 and Lost much of our property -- we want some
 of our Children instructed that they may
 have their eyes open'd and be able to do the
 business of our nation, and if any of your
 society will come and live amongst us and
 instruct our Children that rich flat which
 we were viewing yeasterday we have set apart
 for them to live upon and it shall be for them
 as long as the choose to stay on it" -- We told them we were glad to hear the resolu
 tions they had formed and desired they
 might be strong and keep to them, and that 
 I would inform their Old friends in Philadel
 phia of their talk, but we could not tell whether
 any of our society would come to live among them
 or not, yet we would still remember them &
 be their friends, and when the got their saw
 mill built if the wanted any assistance about
 it or instruction to work with it some of our
 company from the Allegany would be willing
 to come and spend some time with them &
 that in addition to some hoes and Axes that
 were comeing forward for their use we would
 add a set of plow Irons, for all which they
 returnd many thanks and thus our inter-
 view ended to good satisfaction, a favourable
 openness we thought appearing Among the
 Indians at that place for further endeavours
 being used to promote the work of Civilization.
 About noon we set off homewards, call'd by
 the way to see the Delaware Indians, lodg'd
 again under an Indians camp and reach'd
 Allegany next day about two Oclock -- 14th The Indians being return'd from
 Pittsburgh we all went down in a Cannoe
 to Conishadaga to Meet them in counsel
 haveing sent them word the evening before --
 Shortly after we ariv'd a Number of the 
 Indians collected when four new come friends certi
 ficate from the Committee on Indian affairs was
 read and explaind to them with which they
 appeard well satisfied and said it was true what
 our friends had told them last fall that if any
 other young men should incline to come and live among
 the Indians they would be encouraged to come for-
 ward good by civilization and they were
 well pleas'd with the Quakers being among them for
 they thought it was so ordered by the Great Spirit-- I then told them I was about to take up my
 pack and go to my own Countrey -- that I had
 lived very happy this two years among them
 endeavouring to be useful to them and was
 thankful to the Great Spirit that all that
 time we had lived together like Brothers and in good
 friendship, & they must not think hard of
 my leaveing them for I still desired their prosperrity
 and welfare and hoped the would gradually
 come forward in the good work of civilization
 and be strong in their resolutions to overcome
 that great evil strong drink -- Several
 further remarks were made to them but for
 want of an interpreter well qualified for the
 business we could not explain matters so fully
 as was desirable -- 
 We told them that some time ago they had
 made us a small present of some money which
 we were not willing to keep and had therefore
 concluded to add as much to it of our money
 as would purchase them a Yoke of Oxen for
 the use of that Town -- Several matters were
 spoken too by our company for their encourage
 ment in a sober industrious life, and Cornplanter 
 enquireing which way I intended to go home I told
 him up the waters of this River and from thence
 across to the susquehannah - he then concluded
 sending some of his people with me a part of the
 way and said he would come and see me set out on the
 Journey -- Our interview lasted two or three hours
 and ended to good satisfaction an openness still
 appearing among the Indians towards us as at
 the begining, and the way appear'd clearly open
 in my View, to leave them, feeling nothing but
 love towards them as at the begining, and the
 reward of peace for my feeble endeavours to render
 their lifes more comfortable and happy -- And notwithstanding their advancement in
 the work of civilization was but slow and no
 very great progress as yet observable there is sufficient
 cause to hope the work is gradually advan-
 cing, that the Labour bestowd upon that 
 poor distressed people will not be lost but thro'
 faithfulness in those called thereunto be in
 due time crown'd with a degree of the desired
 success at least so far as to leave them with-
 out excuse, and perhaps be like bread cast
 upon the waters which may be gathered
 after many days -- 17th Being the day appointed for my leaveing
 the Indian Countrey Corn-planter came early in
 the morning to take leave of me and return'd
 many thanks for my services amongst
 them, also desired me to remember him to
 my people, and wish'd I might get home
 safe and find my people all well, and in
 particularly desired me to tell the Chiefs of
 the Quakers that he was very thankful
 for their kind endeavours to instruct
 them in a life of civilization and believ'd
 the Great Spirit above was well pleas-
 ed with them it -- My intended route
 being up the Allegany River and across
 to the waters of the Susquehannah Corn-
 planter thought proper that three
 Indians should accompany a part of the
 way One to take my Creature by land
 and two to take me in a Cannoe by water 
 about 60 miles up this River -- Most of
 the men women and Children in our
 Village came to see me set off and divers of
 them appeard very sorry saying it was hard
 they should never see me again -- All things
 being ready and my companion Joel in-
 tending to accompany me a part of the
 way about 8 Oclock We embark'd and
 bid adieu to Genesinguhta where I had
 spent two years & upwards very conten
 ted and happy -- As we past up the river I call'd to bid
 the Indians of the upper Settlement
 farewell who appear'd very friendly and
 some of them manifested their hearty
 good will by furnishing us with the
 best provisions they could afford --
 This day went up the river about 30 miles
 encampt near the mouth of a Creek
 comeing in on the South side of the
 River call'd Teunewanguant which
 Cannoes can pass up several miles
 the evening being wet erected a bark
 shed under which we Lodg'd comfort
 ably, & the Indians haveing kill'd a
 Deer in the River it afforded us plenty 
 of fresh venison which we roasted at
 the fire -- 18th Set forward early, pass'd by some
 fertile flats on the north side of the River
 on one of which is a large plumb Orchard
 near the head of the Indians reservation,
 past the mouth of Chicaswanue, & Issue
 about noon, the latter of which is a boatable
 stream for near forty miles and interlocks
 with the waters of the Genesee River - at the
 mouth of this stream the Indians former
 -ly lived -- Eight miles above Issue the 
 Oswega unites with the Allegany comeing
 in on the North Side which we passt up
 to Francis Kings Settlement 6 miles from
 its mouth and 60 miles from Genesinguh
 ta -- At this place a Town is laid out calld
 Ceres and near it a place calld Lebanon.
 Several houses built, a sawmill erected and
 proposals made for building a Grist mill
 this Summer -- The Land appears to be fertile
 and (except some flats along the river which
 abound with White walnut Hickory & Sugar
 Maple) Generally heavy timbered and hard
 to Clear being Coverd with Hemlock white
 pine, Beech, &c. At this place we Lodg'd 
 and a path being markt thro' the wilderness
 to pine creek which emties into the west Branch
 of Susquehannah Francis King propos'd send
 ing a pilot with me thro the as far as the
 first settlement on Pine Creek -- 19th About eight Oclock tok Leave of my
 companion Joel & the Indians that were with
 me, and proceeded on thro' the wilderness nearly
 an east and sometimes southeast direction--
 past up the waters of the Oswego Creek about
 15 miles, thence over two or three mountains
 and encampt on one of the head waters of the
 Allegany River where it was about large enough
 to turn a mill haveing come I supose twenty
 five miles the path generally pretty good, the Land
 Clear of Stone and of an exelent Quality abound
 ing with Hemlock white paine Beech, and
 in some places wild Cherry and Sugar Maple.
 The night being Clear Lodg'd very comfort-
 ably beside our fire with out any Covering -- 20th Set forward early and pass'd up a remark
 able hollow or narrow vale for about three
 miles which appeard to be about 40 Rod wide
 at the entrance and terminated at a point
 In very high Land running nearly eastward
 thence over the high ridge to the head 
 waters of pine Creek about 20 miles from our
 lodgeing -- This ridge is supposed to be the
 highest Land in the state of Pensylvania, as
 it divides the head waters of the Allegany
 which runs to the westward from the head
 waters of the Tioga and other waters of the
 Susquehannah running eastward, and
 the head waters of the Genesee River which
 runs north, from other waters of the
 Susquehannah running Southward --
 all these streams haveing their sources
 within a few miles of each other -- The land on this Ridge is of a superior
 quality Clear of Stone and favourable
 for Cultivation abounding with much
 Sugar Maple and wild Cherry -- On the East side is the head waters
 of pine Creek which runs very swiftly
 the Land Stony and path very diffi
 cult getting along in places, after going
 down it about 3 miles met with seve
 ral hands cutting a road thro' the
 woods towards the Allegany River
 who were moveing out with their
 Families to settle on the western
 waters -- in a few miles further we 
 come to their encampments where their
 wives were sitting with a number of
 small children beside them, haveing been
 about a month on their Journey thus far
 and I suppos'd it would take them near
 another month to get thro' to the Boat
 able waters of the Allegany -- The men
 cut the road: open about 2 miles pr.
 day, and every few days mov'd their encamp-
 ments their property being drawn on
 sleds by Oxen -- The women were com
 plaining their provisions were nearly
 exhausted & I thought indeed they had a
 dull prospect before them, going into a
 new Countrey where little could be had
 but what they could obtain by hunting. After traveling down this Rapid stream
 12 or 14 miles, some part of the way
 good Land and several smaller streams
 emtying in furnishing abundand opper
 tunity for water works we came to the
 Great Elk lick at which place I was
 inform'd a white man had killed &
 salted up 14 Barrels of Elk meat last
 Fall -- It appeard to be a small pond
 about fifty or sixty yards in circumferance 
 and roads beat in every direction from
 it by the numurous herds of Elk and
 deer that resort thither to water - it is
 said near thirty Elk have been seen
 about it in one drove, & evident marks
 appear that the Indians have formerly
 made it a memorable place -- To this
 place Canoes can come up this stream
 being near 70 miles from where it
 unites with the Susquehannah --
 past on about six miles further and
 met with a small cabbin, (one of the
 before mentioned peoples encampments)
 where we lodg'd comfortably on our blankets
 an exelent flat being near afforded pasture
 for our horses haveing traveled about 30 miles -- 21st Set out early and rode down the Creek
 6 miles to the third fork Where stands the
 first house being 60 miles from kings Settle
 ment -- this was formerly a noted place
 by the Indians, calld the big Meadows -
 some exelent flats here abounding with
 Hickory & White Walnut -- At this place lived one James Mills 
 who had a large family, and one Daughter
 whose activity in hunting was nearly
 equal to that of an Indian, killing Elk
 Deer, and Bears in great numbers --
 Breakfasted here and rode down the
 Creek about 18 miles to the next
 Settlement - the way very difficult to get
 along in many places - the creek on all
 sides Bounded by high towering mountains whose
 craggy lofty tops surpasseth all description -
 In some places I suppos'd them to be 500 feet
 high, cover'd with such stupendous piles
 of Rocks as renderd all approach inac-
 cessible, and some of the tops projected over
 so much that the sun shineing in
 the Front in the afternoon of the day
 made a shadow a considerable ways down
 the Side -- On the summit of one of these
 Rocks I saw a large white animal sitting
 which appeard to be of the fowl kind --
 what it was I could not tell, but the
 wild romantic prospect of the place
 exceeded any thing of the kind I had ever
 ever before seen, and probably had never been
 trodden by the foot of man -- This afternoon I saw two Elk Does in the
 Creek with their young ones by their sides
 about Large as young Calves -- Lodg
 travel'd about 24 miles to day, much of
 the way in the water and over stone &
 Rocks without number and Lodg'd in
 a Whitemans Cabbin where the people were
 very kind, but the knots or small flies so
 very numerous as to render it impossible
 resting comfortably. -- 22nd This day parted with my pilot and pro
 ceeded on down the Creek to the mouth about
 38 miles -- The mountains still continue
 to bound the Creek on each side but the
 valleys more extensive than in yesterdays
 Journey, and Settlements made every few
 miles, several sawmills are also erected
 where timber is saw'd and rafted down
 the Susquehannah -- The inhabitants
 appear kind and glad to see travelers
 chiefly depending on hunting for meat
 and many of them were about move
 ing over to the Allegany waters, saying 
 they were tir'd of this place and determi
 ned to move further back in the woods--
 I concluded they were as far back in the wood
 already as I should like to settle, but there
 appears to be a Class of people advanc'd in
 civilization but one degree about Indians
 that cannot live contented when the inha-
 bitants crowds in upon them -- the like
 to be on the frontiers of the Countrey
 their children are brought up without
 education & indulg'd in the habits of
 Savage life, whereby their morals are
 greatly corrupted, and often prove pernitious
 examples to the poor aborigines of the
 Land -- Near the mouth of pine Creek
 in a body of exelent Land some well cultiva
 ted farms and Large fields of good Grain --
 At Lodg'd at Morrisons Tavern where I got
 good entertainment -- 23rd In the morning cross'd the Creek again
 where it was about 100 yards wide (after have
 ing cross'd it I suppose more than 50 times in
 that many miles distance) and rode down
 the west Branch of the Susquehannah 
 to Williamsport where I din'd -- fine cultiva
 ted farms along the River this stage and great
 Crops of Grain -- also a little village call'd
 Newberry near Licoming Creek -- At Williams
 port the County Courts are held for Lycoming
 County a prosperous little village in which
 is five taverns & situate in a fertile Countrey. In the afternoon met with 15 Waggons Loaded
 with families moveing from Bucks county
 out to Genesee and Niagara -- A number
 of Women and Children were on foot drive
 ing herds of Cattle before them-- About dark ariv'd at Muncy and
 Lodg'd at our friend Wm. Ellises a man
 of Great possessions and wonderful building
 on his farm -- 30 miles to day -- 24th Set out about 10 Oclock and rode to
 Catawessy about 30 miles -- the most
 of the way a hilly Barren Countrey
 coverd with pitch pine, yet the soil
 in places natural for Grain & Grass
 where settlements are made --
 about 10 miles from Catawessy I saw 
 the first Locusts which were there in great
 numbers -- Cross'd the ferry near the
 mouth of fishing Creek, and rode into Catawessy
 about sunset a pleasant little village
 containing about 80 houses, & lodg'd at
 Isaiah Willits Tavern -- 25th Set forward early and rode this
 day about 40 miles to Pensingers tavern -
 The most of the way a barren mountain
 ous Countrey a few valleys excepted about
 the head waters of Schuylkill River -- plenty
 of Taverns on the Road to accommodate Travelers.
 Lodgd at Pensingers - the evening very wet -- 26th Rode 9 miles to Carterstown before Break-
 fast - a pleasant little village containing
 60 or 70 houses mostly Dutch people - situ-
 ated on the fertile Banks of the Schuylkill
 River - in thence thro' Reading and on
 to Pottsgrove in the evening where I had
 the consolation to meet with my beloved
 Kinsman Jacob Lindley and his wedding
 Guests haveing that day taken to wife
 the worthy Ruth Anna Ruther a
 Citizen of that place -- on reflecting 
 on the great change that had taken place
 since my parting with him I was some
 what affected, but meeting with a number
 of my friends and relations at this place
 It was a feast of no little satisfaction --
 In two days more reached home being
 the 28th of the month, after haveing been
 away two years and two months -- and
 in my route home traveled about 390
 miles -- In the Summer of 1805 a number
 of the principal Chiefs and warriers of the Six
 Nations of Indians principally Senecas assem
 bled at Buffalo Creek in the State of New York
 at the particular request of a Missionary from
 the State of Massachusets -- The Missionary being furnished with an
 Interpreter and accompanied by the agent of
 the United States for Indian affairs met the
 Indians in council when the following talk took
 place, first by the Agent Brothers of the Six Nations
 I rejoice to meet you at this time and thank
 the Great Spirit that he hath preserved you
 in health and given me another oppertunity
 of takeing you by the hand - - - Brothers the person who now sits by me
 is a freind who has come a great distance to hold
 a talk with you, he will inform you what his
 Business is and it is my request that you should
 listen with attention to his words. Missionary. . .
 My friends I am thankful for the
 oppertunity afforded us in meeting together
 at this time. I had a great desire to see you
 and enquire into your state and welfare 
 for this purpose I have traveled a great distance
 being sent by your old friends the boston Missionary
 Society. You will recollect they formerly sent
 missionaries among you to instruct you in
 religeon and labour for your good. Although
 they have not heard from you for a long time
 yet they have not forgoten their brothers of
 the Six Nations and are still anxious to do you
 good. Brothers,
 I have not come to get your
 lands or your money but to enlighten your
 minds, and to instruct how to worship the
 Great Spirit agreably to his mind and will
 and to preach to you the Gospel of his son
 Jesus Christ. There is but one religeon and
 one way to serve God and if you do not em
 -brace the right way you cannot be happy
 hereafter, you have never worshiped the
 Great Spirit in a manner acceptable to
 him, but have all your lives been in Great
 errors and darkness. To endeavour to remove
 these errors and open your eyes so that you
 may see clearly is my business among you. Brothers
 I wish to talk with you as one
 friend talks with another. and if you have
 any objections to receive the religeon which I
 preach I wish you to state them and I will 
 endeavour to satisfy your minds and
 remove the objections. Brothers
 I want you to speak your minds
 freely for I wish to reason with you on the
 subject and if possible to remove all doubts
 if there be any on your minds. The subject
 is an important one and it is of consequence
 that you give it an early attention while the
 offer is made you. Your friends the Boston
 Missionary Society will continue to send you
 good and faithful ministers to instruct and
 strengthen you in religeon if on your part
 you are willing to receive them. -- Brothers
 Since I have been in this part
 of the Countrey I have visited some of your
 small Villages and talked with your people,
 they appear willing to receive instruction --
 but as the look up to you as their older brothers
 in Council they want first to know your opinion
 on the subject. You have now heard what I have
 to propose at present I hope you will take
 it into consideration and give me an answer
 before we part. -- After about two hours consultation
 among themselves the Chief commonly cal-
 led by the white people *Red Jacket arose &
 spoke as follows -- * His Indian name is Se,go,he,wautah , which 
 signifies keeper Arise. - - - Brother you say you want an
 answer to your talk before you leave this place
 - it is wright you should have one as you are
 a great distance from home and we dont wish
 to detain you, but we will first look back a
 little and tell you what our Fathers have told
 us and what we have heard from the white
 people -- Friend & Brother
 It was the will of the
 Great Spirit that we should meet together
 this day - he orders all things and has given us
 a fine day for our council - He has taken
 his Garment from before the Sun and caused
 it to shine in with brightness upon us - Our eyes
 are open that we see clearly, our ears are
 unstoped that we have been able to hear
 distinctly the words you have spoken, for
 all these favours we tahank the Great Spirit
 and him only -- Brother
 This Council fire was kindled
 by you it was at your request that we
 came together at this time - we have listen'd
 with attention to what you have said - you
 requested us to speak our minds freely - This
 gives us great joy for we now consider 
 that we stand upright before you and
 can speak what we think -- all have heard your
 voice and all speak to you now as one man, our
 minds are agreed -- Brother
 You say you wanted an answer
 to your talk before you leave this place - it is
 right you should have one as you are a
 great distance from home and we dont
 wish to detain you -- but we will first look
 back a little and tell you what our fathers
 have told us, and what we have heard from
 the white people -- Brother listen to what we say,
 There was
 a time when our fore fathers owned this Great
 Island -- There seats extended from the riseing to
 the Setting sun - The Great Spirit had made
 it for the use of Indians - he had created the 
 Buffalo the Deer and other Animals for food
 he made the Bear and the Beaver, their skins
 served us for clotheing - he had scattered them
 over the Countrey and taught us how to take
 them -- he had caused the earth to produce
 corn for bread. All this he had done for his
 Red children because he loved them - If we
 had some disputes about hunting ground
 they were generally setled without the sheding
 of much blood - But an evil day came up 
 upon us. Your forefathers crossed the great
 waters and landed on this Island -- Their num
 bers were small, they found friends and not
 enemies -- They told us they had fled from
 their own Countrey for fear of wicked men
 and had come here to enjoy their religeon -- They asked for a small seat -- we took pity
 on them granted their request and they
 sat down beside amongst -- we gave them corn and
 meat they gave us pison (alludeing it is
 suppered to ardent spirits) in return. The White people had now found our Countrey
 Tideings were carried Back and more came
 amongst us, yet we did not fear them, we
 took them to be friends they called us Bro-
 thers, we believed them and gave them a
 larger seat -- at length their numbers had
 greatly encreased - they wanted more land
 they wanted our Countrey - our eyes were
 open'd and our minds were became uneasy - Wars
 took place - Indians were hired to fight against
 Indians -- and many of our people were
 destroy'd -- They also brought strong liquors
 amongst us -- it was strong and powerful
 and has slain thousands -- Brother
 Our seats were once large and
 yours were small - you have now become
 a great people - and we have scarcely a 
 place left to spread our blankets - you
 have got our countrey but are not satisfied
 you want to force your religeon upon us. Brother Continue to listen
 You say you are
 sent to instruct us how to worship the
 great Spirit agreably to his mind, and if
 we dont take hold of the religeon which you
 teach we shall be unhappy hereafter -- You
 say that you are right and we are lost -- how
 do you know this to be true? - we understand
 that your religeon is written in a book. if
 it was intended for us as well as you -- why
 has not the Great Spirit given to us, and
 not only to us -- but why did he not give to our
 forefathers the knowledge of that book with
 the means of understanding it rightly?
 We only know what you tell us about it.
 How shall we know what to believe being
 so often deceivd by the white people -- Brother
 You say there is but one way
 to worship & serve the Great Spirit -- if there
 is but one religeon why do you white
 people differ so much about it? Why not
 all agree as you can all read the book. -- Brother
 We do not understand these things 
 We are told that your religeon was given
 to your forefathers and has been handed
 down from father to son - we also have a
 religeon which was given to our forefathers
 and has been handed down to us their children
 we worship in that way, it teaches us to
 be thankful for all the favours we receive
 to love each other and to be unite, we never
 quarrel about religeon.... Brothers,
 The Great Spirit has made us
 all but he has made a great difference --
 between his white & red children. He has
 given us different complexions and differ
 -ent customes. To you he has given the 
 ark, to these he has not open'd our eyes
 we know these things to be true. Since he
 has made so great a difference between
 us in other things - why may we not con
 clude that he has given us a different
 religeon -- according to our understand-
 -ings. the great Spirit does right. He knows
 what is best for his children - we are satisfied. Brother
 we do not want to destroy you
 religeon or to take it from you we only 
 want to enjoy our own. Brother we are told that you have
 been preaching to the white people in
 this place - These people are our neighbours
 we are acquainted with them. we will wait
 a little while and see what effect your prea-
 -ching has upon them - If we find it does them
 good - makes them honest and less dispos'd to
 cheat Indians we will then consider again
 what you have said. -- Brother
 You have now heard our answer
 to your talk, and this is all we have to
 say at present as we are going to part
 we will come and take you by the hand
 and hope the Great Spirit will protect
 you on your Journey and return you
 safe to your friends -- As the Indians began to approach the
 missionary he arose hastily from his seat
 and replied that he would not take them
 by the hand - that there was no fellowship
 between the religeon of God and the works
 of the Devil. This being interpreted to the
 Indians they smild and retir'd in a peac-
 able manner -- The Speech of Red Jacket a chief
 of the Seneca Nation in answer to a 
 Speech of one Richardson who applied
 to the buy the Indians right to the reser-
 -vations lying in the territory commonly
 called the Holland purchase delivered (at
 a Council held at Buffalo Creek in may
 1811 -- Brother we opened our ears to the talk
 you lately delivered to us at our council
 fire. In doing important business it is
 Best not to tell long stories but to come
 to it in a few words. we therefore shall not
 repeat your talk which is fresh in your minds
 we have well considered it, and the advantages
 and disadvantages of your offers. we request
 your attention to our offers answer which is
 not from the speaker alone but from
 all the Sachems and chiefs now round our
 Council fire -- Brother We know that great men as well
 as great Nations haveing different interrest
 have different minds, and do not see the same
 subject in the same light, but we hope our
 answer will be agreable to you and your
 employers -- Brother your application for the purchase
 of our lands is to our minds very extra-
 -ordinary. It has been made in a crooked 
 manner -- You have not walked in the
 strait path pointed out by the great coun-
 -cil of your nation -- you have no writeing
 from our Great father the President. In make-
 -ing up our minds we have looked back and re-
 membered how the Yorkers purchased and lands
 in former times. They bought them piece after
 piece for a little money paid to a few men
 in our nation and not to all our Brethren
 untill our planting & hunting grounds have become very
 small - & if we sell these we know not where to
 spread our blankets -- Brother you tell us your employers have purchased
 of the Council of Yorkers a right to buy our lands
 we do not understand how this can be the
 lands do not belong to the Yorkers they are
 ours and were given to us by the Great Spirit Brother, we think it strange that you should
 Jump over the lands of our brethren in the
 east and came to our council fire so far off
 to get our lands. When we sold our lands in
 the East to the white people, we determined
 never to sell those we kept which are as small
 as we can live comfortably on -- Brother you want us to travel with you
 and look for other lands. If we should sell our
 lands and move off into a distant countrey
 towards the Setting Sun, we should be look'd 
 upon in the Countrey to which we go as
 forreigners & strangers and be despised by the
 red as well as the white people men and we
 should soon be surrounded by the white
 people who will there also kill our game
 come upon our lands and try to get them
 from us -- Brother - We are determined not to sell our
 lands but to continue on them. They are
 fruitfull and produce us corn in abundance
 for the support of our women and chil-
 dren and grass and herbs for our Cattle -- Brother At the Treaties held for the purchase of
 our lands the white men with sweet voices
 and smileing countenances faces told us
 they loved us & that they would not cheat
 us -- but that the kings children on the other
 side of the Lake would cheat us. When we go on
 the other side of the Lake the kings children tell
 us they your people will cheat us best with
 sweet voices and smileing faces assure us of their
 love; and that they will not cheat us. These
 things puzzle our heads and we believe that
 they Indians must take care of themselves
 and trust either in your people or in the
 Kings children -- Brother At a late Council we requested
 our Agents to tell you that we would not sell
 our lands and we think you have not spoken 
 to our Agents since they would have told
 you so, and we should not have met you at our
 Council fire at this time. Brother they white people buy and sell false
 rights to our Lands and your employers you say
 have paid a great price for their right - They must
 have plenty of money to spend it in buying and
 selling false wrights to lands belonging to Indians
 They loss of it will not hurt them but our
 lands are of great value to us and we wish
 you to go back to your employers and to tell them
 and the Yorkers that they have no right to
 buy and sell false wrights to our lands belonging to
 Indians -- Brother this is all we got to say.
