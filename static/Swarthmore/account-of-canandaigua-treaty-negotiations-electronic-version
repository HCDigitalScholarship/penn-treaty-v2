 To the Meeting for Sufferings
 Dear Friends
 Agreeably to our prospect of attending the Treaty to be 
 held with the Indians of the Six Nations at Canandaque in New York 
 Government, we left this City the 15th of the 9th Mo: and reached that 
 place on the 26th of the same: On our arrival we found but about 160 
 collected, and these chiefly of the Oneida Tribe, with whom we had divers 
 conferences before the others came in; we also found about 30 Members of 
 our religious Society settled within the compass of fifteen Miles of the place 
 of Treaty who had emigrated chiefly from the New England Governments, 
 these friends in their distant & scattered situation appeared glad to see us 
 and engaged our attention & concern. We had Meetings on the 
 first Days of the Week during our continuance there, which were held to 
 satisfaction and attended by our fellow professors & many others both 
 Indians & Whites; amongst these people we apprehend a few Books might 
 be profitably distributed. All the Indians who were expected being at length assembled 
 to the amount of 1600 and upwards, the Treaty commenced; we attended 
 all the public Councils as well as some which were held by the Commissi 
 oner more privately, and had frequent & satisfactory opportunities of 
 conference with the Sachems & other Chiefs, in which we endeavoured 
 to impress thier Minds with a sense of the advantages to be derived from 
 living in peace one with another and with all Men, and of the expedi- 
 ency of leading a more sober & quiet Life, that they might draw down 
 the divine Blessing upon them; they heard us with attention and we 
 hope it was not without some good effect. They still retain a 
 lively remembrance of the the just & friendly treatment thier forefathers 
 experienced from the first founders of Pennsylvania, continue to dis- 
 tinguish him by the name of Onas and consider friends as his de- 
 scendants, expressing that if we deceive them they can no more place 
 any confidence in mankind As an enquiry had been made in time past respecting the 
 original Owners of the Land about Hopewell in Virginia , soon after 
 the Indians were collected, some of the principal Cheifs of the different 
 Nations visited us on the occasion and revived the subject, expressing 
 their gladness that friends were willing to do justice; divers conferences 
 were held amongst themselves and with us relative to that business, the 
 Issue of which was that we were all of opinion the Tuscaroras were the 
 people who formerly owned that Country; they are now the sixth Nation 
 in the Confederacy, live on the Seneca's Land and sit with them in 
 Council, but we believe are not considered as having a right in the 
 Soil; General Chapin Superintendent of the Six Nations upon en- 
 quiry being of the same opinion, gave us his judgement in writing, which 
 we have now to present to the Meeting. About 20 Delawares also 
 attended the Treaty, some of whom came from Conestogoe Manor & com- 
 plained to us of the murder of their relations and of their having been 
 driven from their profsessions without any just compensation being 
 made, requesting we would mention it on our return, that the Injuries 
 done them & their people might be redressed. Early in the Business we presented the address of friends, which 
 was read & interpreted, they were attentive to it's contents and expressed 
 their satisfaction During our stay with them they made several speeches to us, 
 and some difficulties occuring in the course of the Treaty, they re- 
 quested our council & advice, which we gave them as well as we were 
 qualified in our delicate & trying situation: some of these Speeches 
 express a regard & friendship for our religious society, which; with some 
 observations & occurences contained in our Notes, may if the Meeting 
 thinks proper be selected with the assistance of a few friends & offered 
 to a future Meeting. It may be proper to remark that altho' it afforded us satis- 
 faction that a Treaty was concluded in such a manner as that we 
 hope peace is established between the six Nations & the United 
 States, yet as it confirms the right of the United States to large 
 Tracts of their Country which were obtained by right of conquest 
 we were therefore most easy to omit subscribing our Names as wit- 
 nesses to the Articles thereof. At the close of the Treaty we assembled the Chiefs of all 
 the Nations and delivered them the presents of friends, which they 
 gratefully received; Jaspar Parrish an Interpreter for Government distri- 
 uted them at their request agreeable to the Numbers contained in each 
 Nation. We continued with them about seven weeks, and had no cause 
 to doubt our having been in our proper places, yet with sorrow had to 
 observe that the pernicious effecs of spirituous liquors being handed 
 freely to them were highly injurious and considerably retarded the Issue 
 of the Business. Many are the Difficulties & Sufferings to which the Indians are 
 subjected and their present situation appears loudly to claim the Sym- 
 pathy & attention of the Members of our religious Society & others who 
 have grown numerous & opulent on the former inheritance of these 
 poor declining people: we can not but believe some mode may be 
 fallen upon of rendering them more essential service than has yet 
 been adopted. Our Engagements were often very trying & straitning, yet 
 thro' the kindness of providence we were preserved in much harmony 
 & Unity through them all, and on the whole have reason to hope, the 
 object of the Concern was in some degree answered & are thankful 
 in being permitted to return home with a portion of peace after 
 an exercising & fatiguing Journey Philada:20th:12 mo:1794 John Parrish David Bacon William Savery James Emlen
