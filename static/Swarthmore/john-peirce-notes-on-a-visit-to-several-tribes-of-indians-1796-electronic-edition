 Notes, on a visit to Several Tribes of Indians. 1796
 Fifth month 30th about
 ten in the morning left
 my Habitation at Darby;
 was accompanied by my
 Friends John Humphreys 
 and John Hunt as far as
 Casper Hains’ in German
-town, where our Company
 had appointed to meet;
 who accordingly attended,
 being as follows, viz. Isaiah
 Rowland, James Cooper ,
 Joseph Sansom , Henry
 Symmons & Enoch Walker ;
 here we dined; and after Dinner,
 taking Leave of our Friends,
 we proceeded on to David Cum-
min’s this Evening; where
 we lodged. 31st Proceeded on, dined at Oliver
 Paxtons, near Curruls Ferry
 on Dalaware, from Phila-
34.delphia about 34 Miles. -
 Thence up the River, and
 crossed at Michel’s Ferry,
 16.and thence to Kingwood, 16
 Miles, lodged at Henry
 Clifton’s and Jon Allen ’s. Between the last mentioned
 Stages crossed a commanding
 Eminence, called Calvin’s Hill which,
 which I supposed to rise more
 than 200 Feet in perpendi-
cular Height, and what was
 remarkable, on the Top, or
 near it, was a nearly level
 Meadow, which appeared to be
 a cold sour Swamp. Sixth mo. 1st. This Day crossed
 several considerable Moun-
tains; on some of which we had
 a grand prospect of the ma-
jestic works of Nature, in an
 extended view of a large Coun-
try, variegated with less, and
 greater Hills, Valleys, and
 Plains; producing Reflecti-
ons humbling to my
 Mind 
 we stopped twice at Inns to
 feed our Horses, at one of
 which got some dry victuals
 which served us for a Dinner,
 and arrived in the Evening
 at Jacob Lunday’s in Hard-
wick County, in the Jersey;
 35.from Kingwood about 35 Miles. This Friend is seated in a
 fertile Valey almost surround
-ed with Barren Mountains,
 his Wife is public, and has
 visited many of the Meetings
 in this Continent; by which
 means she was both known
 and nearly esteemed by some
 of us; that meeting with
 her here under her own and
 Husband’s hospitable Roof was
 reviving. 2nd. Continued up a kind of a
 Valey, between two considerable
 Mountains, stoped twice at
 Inns to feed, at one of which
 dined, and got to an Inn at
 Chester in Orange County, in
50. the Evening; where we lodged 50
 Miles. 3rd. This morning concluded
 to turn a little out of our direct
 Course, for the purpose of fall-
ing in with some of our Friends,
 rode about 7 Miles to Breakfast,
 and about 13 more to Daniel
 Byrns’ on the North River,
 where we dined, and rested
 ourselves Several Hours; –– -
 Thence up the River about
 12 Miles, to Edward Halluck’s ,
 where we lodged, and were
 kindly entertained, he being an
 Ancient Friend of a very kind
 and hospitable Disposition.
 32.Travailed this Day but 32 miles. Here we Stand two Days &
 rested ourselves, wrote some Letters Home, and attended
 their Meeting on first Day. 6th. Being Second Day, left our
 agreeable Quarters, and pro-
ceeded on our Journey, our Gd.
 Friend Edward Halluck , accom-
paning us Several Miles;
 20.dined at Eusopus, about 20 Miles;
 This Town was entirely burnt
 by the English in 1777; and
 has now a Considerable Num-
ber of good Houses; then
 rode to Cats.kill where we
24. Lodged; 24 Miles. Here we were entertained
 at a private House; for com-
ing to the Creek after Night,
 and finding no Inn on this
 Side; the Creek not rideable,
 and no Boat to be had, things
 wore a disagreeable Appearance,
 but a friendly Man, Jacob
 Bogarder, being privy to
 our Distress, very compli-
santly offered us Entertain-
ment, which we gratefully
 accepted; and found him
 to be a Man of Intelligence,
 and some Consequence, andliving
 in considerable State, for this
 part of the Country. 7th. Staid Breakfast this
 Morning at our Lodgings,
 and while it was preparing,
 took a walk with our Land-
lord to view the following curious Phaeno-
menon, on his Farm, from
 60 to 100 Perches from his
 dwelling House; A Hill
 which laid in the Northwest
 Angle, formed by the Meeting of the North River &
 Cats.Kill Creek which raised,
 as I supposed from 100 to 150
 feet of perpendicular Height,
 from the Bed of said Waters, three
 Days since, broke near the Extre-
mity of the Ellivation; and one
 part of it sunk almost perpen-
dicularly down between 50 &
 60 feet, next adjoining the great-
est Elevation, and gradually up
 toward the Declivity of
 the Hill, leaving the ground
 almost level; the Quantity
 moved was about two Acres; we
 walked over the Ground, and
 indeed it was an amazing and
 Solemn Sight, the Stupendous
 Cracks and broken Earth made
 an awful appearance; The
 Inhabitants of a small town over the Creek saw it going, and
 were much alarmed, supposing
 it to have been the Beginning
 of an Earthquake, but they
 heard no rumbling, nor discovered
any Shock: there was also on this
 Hill when it sunk a flock of
 Sheep grazing, which appeared
 much frighted with the first
 Motion of the Earth, and(as it
 sunk gradually) and ran vio-
lently several Courses at first,
 but quickly gathered all close
 together, near the Center, and
 went down with the Ground,
 and received no hurt. After Breakfast ferried over
 this Creek, and proceeded on,
 dined at Edward Halluck Junr. 
 at a small Town, on the
 North River, called Baltimore,
 from our Last Stage about 22 miles
 42.thence to albany, about 20 miles,
 here we put up our Horses
 at an Inn, and lodged some
 of us at a Friend’s House, and
 others of us at a friendly Man’s
 named Thomas Spencer , where
 we were kindly entertained. This we are informed is
 the oldest City in the Conti-
nent, but it appears a poor
 place; they have no regular
 Market; the Streets are ex-
tremely irregular, crooked and
 dirty; the walks on each Side,
 are paved with very indifferent
 Stone, the middles generally
 not paved at all: They Say
 there are better than 1000
 Houses in this place, and
 some of them are three
 Stories and otherways good
 and handsome Buildings;
 but the greater part appear
 to be old & inconvenient, of one,
 one and an half and two sto-
ries, mostly of brick on Wood. Here we received Informa-
tion from a Man who had
 been in the Indian Coun-
try that the greater part
 of the Oneida, Onondaga &
 Cayuga Reservations had
 been lately purchased by
 the State of New York:
 This Information a little
 alarmed us, and we concluded
 it expedient to wait on the
 Surveyor General at his Office
 in this Town; and two of us
 being named for that Ser-
vice, we accordingly went to
 his Office, and found him
 a very obliging and inteligent
 man,
 Man, and he marked out on
 our Map, what had been pur-
chased, and what was still
 reserved; by which we were
 fully satisfied with Regard
 to the Quantity of Land still
 in possession of the Indians:
 This Interview was on the
 Morning of the 8th Instant;
 and in the Afternoon we
 concluded to move forward;
 and accordingly rode to Sche-
nectady a Town on the
14. Mohawk River 14 Miles
 from Albany. Here we lodged at a good Inn
 kept by English people; our
 Entertainment and Attendance
 excited Admiration, being equal,
 especially in the Womans de-
partment, to almost any thing
 in that way, in the City of
 Philadelphia: This is a
 Smart Town containing, as they
 say, about 600 Houses many
 of them good Buildings: from
 here the Mohawk is boatable
 upwards of 100 Miles; but the
 Navigation is so extremely
 difficult, by reason of Shoal
 Water and Rapids, that, if the
 Roads were good, Land Carriage
 would be preferable: Between
 here and the North River
 is a large falls, which occasions
 a
 a carrying place from Albany
 here of 14 miles. 9th. This Morning crossed the Mo-
hawk in a Boat, continued up
 the River between two Moun-
tains; the flats on each Side
 the River appeared fertile,
 but narrow; in about 20 miles
 came to old general Jonstons 
 Seat; it was a large Stone House,
 for this part of the Country; and
 had Some out Houses of a curious
 Structure; dined at Cagnawago,
 25. from Schenectady 25 miles: This
 is an Indian Name, the Etymology
 of which is, Cag in the Wagon. Here John Jonston , son of
 old William Jonston , with about 
 600 Indians and Regulars,
 did much mischief, in the
 Time of the American War;
 they burnt the Country for
 about 40 Miles up and down
 the River, and many of the
 Inhabitants lost their Lives,
 amongst which was the parents,
 and other Connections of our
 Present Landlady, which has
 tended to embitter her
 Mind against the Natives
 to this Day. Thence up the River to
 Jacob Spraker ’s, who keeps a ferry
 over the Mohawk, where we
 lodged: He has a gracious
 House
 House on the Outside, but
 within, in most respects, below
 indifferent; from our last
10. Stage 10 Miles. 10th. Crossed the River in a
9. Boat, and rode about 9 Miles
 to Breakfast: here, and for
 Some Miles back, the
 fertile Flats are much
 wider than they were for
 Some Distance, where we
 rode yesterday morning: In the Course of this Stage,
 riding up the River, and ob-
serving the fertility of the Land,
 and particularly that of the
 Flats on each Side of the River,
 which a few years ago were
 occupied by the Indians, my
 Mind was tendered in reflecting
 on their Situation; how they
 are tossed from place to place,
 and deprived of their Lands,
 almost as soon as their
 fertility becomes known to
 the white people; and it
 settled in my Mind, that
 it could hardly be the Will
 of the great Founder of the
 Universe, that this valu-
able Country should remain
 unimproved; and that therefore,
 the only Means, whereby the
 Natives can secure to them-
selves their possessions, is
 to endeavor to improve
 in Civilization, and in the
 holy fear of the Lord; becoming
 gradually a religiously organ-
ized Body. Thence up the River about
 18 Miles further and dined
18. at a place called the German
 Flats; here we were informed,
 that these Flats, for Several
 Miles back of this place, have
 been settled with white peo-
ple for near 80 years, and
 we observed in the Course of
 our last stage several old
 Houses, and Orchards, the Ap-
pearance of Which accorded
 with this Information: We also saw many Sugar
 Maples in this Day’s ride, one
 of which was four feet over;
 but generally from one to
 two, and two and a half. We are also informed, that
 notwithstanding the fertility
 of the Land here, there is ve-
ry Little Grain of any kind
 raised for Market: the Land
 being generally in possession
 of the Dutch, and their De-
scendents; who have a Character
 here directly opposed to that of their
 Country People in Pennsyl-
vania. Thence up the River
 to a little Village called Fort-
Schuyler 18 Miles from our
 last Stage; here we crossed the
 Riveron a Bridge, and pro-
ceeded on to White’s Town
 4 Miles further, where we
22. lodged. Twelve or fifteen Miles of
 this last Stage was through a
 new Settled Country; the Land
 appears good, & the Settlements
 rapid and thriving; the Set-
lers mostly from New England,
 but some from New Jersey:
 These people generally build
 their Houses contiguous to
 each other, and are content
 with small Farms; many
 of them not more than
 100 Acres with the Allowance
 that the Country for many
 Miles together along the great Road resembles
 a scattered Village. 11th. This morning had
 a Conference together at
 our Lodgings and being
 now near the Indian
 Country, we felt our
 Minds seriously impressed
 with an increasing weight
 of the Business we are 
 engaged in; and united in
 the expediency of keeping
 Minutes of our proceedings
 therein; and one of our
 Number was appointed
 to that Service. After which we had
 a satisfactory Conference
 with Col. Floyd , one of the
 Superintendants appointed
 by the Government of
 New York to the Special
 Care and Oversight of the
 Brothertown Indians; and
 he informed us, that this
 Tribe is sufficiently provided
 for, in all necessary agricultural
 Implements &c. and that they
 Stand in no need of any Assis-
tance from us, except in Ad-
vice, Instruction &c. and also
 that it would be very desirable
 to him, and those connected
 with him, that one of our
 Friends should reside for
 Some time with this tribe
 in the Capacity of an In-
structor in Husbandry &c.
 which proposition is re-
ferred for future Considera-
tion, when we may be more
 fully acquainted with the
 Situation of the neighbour-
ing Tribes. This respectable Man also
 informed us, that he believed
 the general Disposition of
 the people in those parts,
 tho’ so near the frontiers, would
 be very favorable to our Bu-
siness; which was to our En-
couragement; as we had met
 with Evincements of a
 contrary Disposition
 about 40 Miles further
 down the River. After Dinner agreed to go
 forward into the Indian Country;
 we were informed it was about
 20 Miles to the Stockbridge
 Settlement, where we wished
 to go this Evening: We rode
 about 9 miles through the
 white Settlements, and stopping
 at a House to enquire the
 way, we found it to be the last
 belonging to white people: Here we met with an In-
dian, who knowing, or at least
 mistrusting us, by our Appear
ance, shewed great Friendship,
 calling us Brothers & Quakers,
 and offered to pilot us to the
 Indian Settlement; but being
 much in Liquor, and having a
 Gun and Hatchet, it appeared
 some Trial to accept his Of-
fer; more especially as the
 Evening was approaching;
 but understanding the Road
 was difficult, and not a single
 House to be found on it, we
 at length concluded to Submit
 to it: He was one of the Oneida’s,
 and appeared very wild and sa-
vage, and would frequently make
 a loud, and frightful shouting
 as he went through the Woods;
 but he brought us Safe to a
 Small Indian Settlement of
 the Oneidas, within about three
 Miles of Captain Hendricks ,
 Chief of the Stockbridge, where
 we had proposed going, but
 Night being come upon us,
 we concluded to take up our
 Lodging here; which we
 accordingly did, having rid-
den about 17 miles, of Such
17. Roads, particularly the
 last half of it, as none of
 our company excepting
 our Indian Guide, had
 ever seen before. Here we began our Indian
 Fare, took our Blankets for our
 Beds, and Saddles for our pillows;
 and supped on Milk, with a
 little Indian Bread in it, having
 wooden spoons, or Ladles to
 sup it out of a large general
 Reservoir: But I believe we were all
 favored with quiet and easy
 Minds; though we were cold
 in the Night, and Sore and
 Stiff in the Morning. The Name of our Host was
 Hendrick Smith , who with his
 Brother in law, a Stockbridge, could
 talk a little English: He had
 18 Head of horned Cattle, Several
 of his Cows were excellent; he
 had about three Acres of Indian
 Corn planted, and enclosed, and
 a grass Lot of nearly equal
 Dimensions also enclosed; and
 had made some preparations
 for building a new House; but
 he said he was afraid to build;
 for by and by his Chiefs would
 sell the Land to white people,
 and then he should have to
 leave it; he wished we would
 make their Chiefs divide
 the Land and let every one
 have his own Share; and
 then, he said, he would clear
 a great deal: This he and
 his Brother-in-law informed us,
 was what the Indians wanted;
 but their Chiefs would not
 agree to it. This Sentiment appeared
 to be accompanied with
 Rationality, and some of
 us were ready to adopt Se-
cret Conclusions, that it
 would be our Duty to give
 it our Interest; but upon
 further acquaintance with
 those people, and more minute-
ly investigating the Subject,
 we found, that it
 had its origin, perhaps with
 the greater part who
 approved it, in a Disposition
 very contrary to what we would
 wish to encourage amongst
 them; viz. that of being indivi-
dually able to sell and lease
 Lands to the white people; which
 power had been heretofore suf-
ficiently proven prejudicial
 to several of the Tribes, now
 living in this reservation, by
 tending finally to root them
 out of their native possessions. There nevertheless appears
 great Room for prudent Exer-
tions to encourage and assist
 these people, in falling up-
on some safe plan of securing
 to Individuals, and their Offsp
 Offspring, the Fruits of their
 Industry: for whilst Improve-
ments remain in the present
 precarious State, the reflecting
 Mind must inevitably feel
 a Strong blunt to the Stimulus
 of Action. 12th. This Morning our Indian
 Host, came in and told us his
 Horse was dead, he had been
 ailing about three weeks; and
 that this was the eleventh Horse
 which he had lost within five
 years: this Accorded with an
 Account we had before received
 of the Mortality of Horses in
 this Country. About eight o’clock clock Cap. Hendricks
 Aupaumut, principle Chief
 of the Stockbridge Nation, and to
 whom we had sent a Runner
 the Evening before, came, with
 two others of his Tribe, to meet
 us, and conduct us to his Town;
 with whom we went, and ariving
 at his Habitation, we were a
 little surprised with the smalness
 and meanness of it; but having
 no prospect of bettering ourselves,
 we very deliberately lit, and after
 some time ventured in, but our
 surprise was soon turned into
 astonishment, when we saw
 the Table spread for our Break-
fast; the Tea Tackling was
 brought out; good wheat Bread,
 and Butter of a superlative Qua-
lity made their appearance; that,
 in short, we had a first Rate
 Pennsylvania Breakfast. This being first Day, we
 felt our Minds engaged, to set
 down together, to feel after inward
 Stillness, and ability to perform
 Spiritual Worship; and about
 eleven OClock, having obtained
 leave of our Host, who appears
 a serious, sensible Man, we sat
 down, in Company with him,
 his Family, and Several of
 his Indian Neighbors, who,
 without any Invitation from us,
 came in; they sat in a good
 Degree Solid, and appeared
 thoughtful
 thoughtful; but, as I conceived,
 shewed some Uneasiness with
 our Silence: A few Words were
 Spoken, informing that none
 of our Number were public
 Ministers, and pointing out
 the necessity of inward and
 Spiritual Worship. In the Evening of this Day
 had a Conference with several
 several of the Chiefs and Coun-
selors of the Stockbridge nation,
 at the House of our Host Cap.
 Hendrick; in which he made
 us a speech, expressive of their
 Gladness to See us; and that we
 were heartily welcome to their
 Town; then proceeded to inform
 us of their former and present
 Situation, which he did with
 great Clearness, and precision: We then briefly informed them
 of our motives for coming to
 their Country; and adjourned
 to meet their whole Nation,
 in general Council tomorrow
 Morning at 10 OClock. 13th. Within about an hour of the
 Time appointed, the Indians
 generally met, made us a
 Short Speech, expressing their
 Gladness to see us, and apolo-
gising for their Deficiency
 with regard to the Hour ap-
pointed; we then proceeded to
 inform them of the Nature
 of our Business, and read
 our
 our Certificate to them; after
 which we were enabled, pretty
 clearly to point out to them
 many of the obvious Causes
 of their present Inferiority,
 in point of Living, to the White
 people; together with the means
 whereby this disparity might
 be removed, greatly to the Advan-
tage of them and their posterity,
 with which they appeared to
 be satisfied; and after a short
 Consultation amongst themselves,
 they informed us, that they had
 Listened to us with Attention,
 and had, as it were, swallowed
 down our Words, and should
 deeply consider them; after
 which they would give us
 their Mind on the different
 Subjects recommended to them. From several private Con-
ferences with some of their Chiefs
 we learn, that the Stockbridge
 Indians (who are not of the five
 Nations) consist of about sixty
 Families, and 300 Individuals;
 The possess 23040 Acres of
 excellent Land, which was given
 to them by the Oneidas; about
 the Close of the American War;
 and was confirmed by deed,
 containing a Clause baring
 against their selling or leasing
 to white people: They divide
 their Land into 100 Acre Lots;
 and every Family has one Lot;
 and every Son is to have a Lot,
 laid off by a certain Order un-
til the whole is Occupied: They
 have a sawmill, three Carts, three
 pair of good Oxen, and perhaps
 some other Things which they
 enjoy in common; but in gene-
ral they possess their Improve-
ments, and other Fruits of their
 Industry as private property;
 and even buy and sell, of and to
 the white people and one an-
other; sometimes giving their
 Notes and Obligations in like
 Manner with them: and we
 are informed our Host, Cap.
 Hendrick, raised near 100 Bus.
 of wheat last year, besides a
 Quantity of Indian Corn. They have also an Income
 from general Government
 of 350 Dollars a year: They
 do not appear ignorant in
 any considerable Degree, of
 good Matters of tilling their
 Ground: most Families have
 one Cow, and some of them
 have Several; that little appears
 to be wanting here but a spi-
rit of Industry, Sobriety and fru-
gality, to make these people,
 not only tolerable, but easy
 in their Circumstances: and 
 to this End a skillful provision
 for the Security of private In-
terest might much contribute. Here it may be seasonable
 to
 to remark, that we have
 found, since we came to this
 Place, serious Occasion for
 the Necessity of Friends, both
 in a collective and private
 Capacity, being scrupulously
 guarded in the Letters they
 send to these people; for we
 find them very ingenious
 in construing them to their
 own advantage; and they
 appear to hold them little
 inferior, in point of Obligation
 to the most absolute Contrasts. 14th. Attended a general Coun-
cil of the Oneida’s, at their
 Town, about four Miles from
 the Stockbridge Settlement;
 and in about two Hours after
 the Time appointed they
 collected; and the Business
 was opened by a short
 Speech on their part, ex-
pressing their Gladness
 to see their old Friends
 the Quakers, that we might
 speak Face to face. We
 then briefly informed them
 of our Errand into their Coun-
try; and finding that we had
 a very imperfect Interpre-
ter, we confided to adjourn
 the
 the Council ‘til 5th Day
 the 16th. at ten OClock
 in the morning, and re-
quested the Attendance of
 their Women and young
 people: then returned
 to our Lodgings at Stockbridge. 15th. This morning three of
 our Number attended with
 several of the Stockbridge
 Chiefs and principle men,
 in consulting the best me-
thods of repairing their Saw-
mill Dam, whilst others of
 our Company were employed
 in a useful Improvement at
 our Lodgings. In the Afternoon attended
 a general Council of a small
 Body of the Tuscororas, who live
 on sufferance upon the Oneida
 Lands; these people consist of
 twelve Families, about 58 In-
dividuals, have 43 horned Cat-
tle, 2 Yoke of Oxen, and one plow;
 and have the Offer of 200 Acres
 of Land to a family by the
 Oneidas; but only three of
 their Number have yet taken
 up with the Offer; they be-
ing generally too indolent to
 enclose, clear and till Land
 when given to them; although
 the Land here is of an excel-
lent Quality, and easy of Culture. They also conceive themselves
 under some Difficulties with
 Regard to the Oneidas Offer
 of Land; as they refuse to se-
cure any Quantity to them
 in a National Capacity; but
 merely admit them to indivi-
dually enjoy the aforesaid Quan-
tity in like Manner with
 their own people; and sub-
ject to the future disposal
 of the Oneida Chiefs. These people reminded us
 of an Expectation given them
 by Friends at a late Treaty,
 of a Compensation for some
 Lands settled by Friends
 and others in a certain place
 in Virginia; where they sup-
pose themselves to have some
 Claim: this led us into a
 particular Enquiry into the
 Nature of their Claim; but
 we found them very imperfect
 in their Knowledge of the
 Matter, so that we could get
 no Light from them on the
 Subject. 16th. Again attended the ge-
neral Council of the Oneida’s;
 they assembled as usual, more
 than an hour after the time
 appointed; and opened the
 Council with a short welcome;
 we
 we now had Cap. Jacob Reed 
 for our Interpreter, who had
 been educated in an English
 School: We again opened the
 Nature of our Business; and read
 our Certificate from our friends
 to them; after which we proceeded
 to shew them the Advantage and
 necessity of a Change in their
 Manner of Life; that their young
 Men ought to work, and be indus-
trious to plow and sow their Land,
 to raise Grain to make Bread
 for themselves; and for their
 old People and Children who could
 not work; and that they should
 get many Cows to give them
 Milk; and keep Sheep and
 Such Things like the white
 people do; and that their
 Women should learn to spin
 the wool that would come off
 their Sheep, to make them
 Blankets and Clothes, to keep
 them and their Children
 warm in cold Weather; and
 that we were willing to shew
 them how to do those things;
 that some of our young men
 would stay a while with them,
 (if they were willing,) to instruct
 them how the white people
 tilled the land (for we had before
 united in the Belief that this
 was the most fruitable place
 to make our Settlement) but
 but informed them withal, that
 they ought not depend too much
 on their Brothers, the Quakers,
 for help; but that they must try
 to help themselves; that we were
 willing to assist them a little
 in the Beginning; but as we
 wanted to help all their In-
dian Brothers a little, and
 as there was a great many
 of them, they could not expect
 that we could do a great deal
 for any one Nation; and more-
over, as we saw they had a great
 deal of very good Land; an as we
 were willing to shew them
 how to work their good Land,
 that they might live comfortably,
 and have plenty of every thing, if
 they would but take our Advice,
 and learn to work, and to be in-
dustrious, sober, and saving; but
 if they would not be persuaded
 to help themselves, but would
 still continue to live in their
 old way, that their Brothers
 the Quakers would soon grow
 tired of helping them: after
 we had thus fully opened our
 Prospects, and relieved our
 Minds to them, they gave
 us a short answer expressing
 their Willingness to comply
 with our Advice: The Council
 then braking up they mostly
 withdrew; but the Chiefs, &
 old Men soon returned, and
 desired to speak a few more
 words to us; which when we
 had agreed to, and were seated
 down, they proceeded to inform,
 that their Women had heard
 the good words that we had said
 to them; and that they had
 now exorted their Husbands &
 all their Men, to mind all
 the good Words that their Bro-
thers the Quakers, had said
 to them; and that every thing
 that they had said was good;
 and that they ought to do it all. Here it may be proper
 to remark, that truly the
 women have great Cause
 to be on our side in this Bu-
siness; for in proportion to
 the Rudeness, and uncultiva-
tion of these people, are the
 Hardships and Difficulties
 of their Women greatly increas-
ed; for where the Men think
 it a reproach for them to work,
 all the Chopping, Howing &c.
 necessarily fall upon their
 Women: and as they increase
 in Civilization, as is evident
 in the Stockbridge and Bro-
thertown’s, the women are
 gradually relieved from this
 Drudgery, and their Labours
 con confined more of their Houses, and
 amongst their Children, where
 they ought to be. And such has lately been the
 Case, as we are creditably informed,
 among the Oneida’s, that if a
 Man was catched caught by his friend
 cutting off a stick of wood, or how-
ing a Hill of Corn, he would
 appear as much ashamed, as
 if he had been caught in a dis-
honorable or wicked Action. At the Close of this Council
 we had a Conference with the
 Chiefs; from which, and our
 own Observations, we learn,
 that the Oneida’s possess a
 large Tract of excellent Land,
 supposed to be about 12 miles
 by 20: They consist of about
 620 Individuals, have an In-
come from general Govern-
ment of 700 Dollars a year;
 out of which Government
 has Liberty to furnish them
 with a Smith and Materials;
 which has been done at the
 Expense of about 200 Dollars
 a year; they have also Liberty
 out of this Sum to furnish
 them with a School, by employ-
ing a Schoolmaster, which is
 not done, said to be from the
 Difficulty of getting a suitable
 Teacher; which we regret, as such
 an Institution, if rightly under-
taken and prosecuted must cer-
tainly be much more advanta-
geous to these people than
 the Money. They have also about
 5000 Dollars annually
 coming in from the State
 of New York; they have also
 a Sawmill built by Govern-
ment; and a Gristmill begun;
 which Government are under
 Obligations to complete. They have a considerable Num-
ber of horned Cattle, Horses,
 and some good working Cattle. From the above Delineation
 of the Circumstances and Si-
tuation of these people, it must
 evidently appear; that their
 Chance for a comfortable Sub-
stance far exceeds that of
 the majority of the white
 Inhabitants of Pennsylvania
 and parts adjacent. - That
 in short there appears but
 little in the way of their
 becoming good Livers but
 their excessive Indolence,
 want of Oeconomy, and Love
 of Strong Drink; in the latter
 of which Some Exertions have
 been made by the old Men
 and Chiefs here, as well as
 amongst the Stockbridge’s, and
 we understand no strong Drink
 is allowed to be sold in their
 Towns; and we have, at each
 place, been concerned to Strength-
en these Exertions; yet it is
 Sorrowfully evident, that they
 too frequently find Means to
 get this baneful Article by
 applying to the frontier retail-
ers: After obtaining the above,
 we returned in the Evening
 to our Lodgings at Stockbridge.
 17th. The forepart of this Day
 some of our Company were en
gaged in writing and digesting
 our Concerns, whilst others
 were usefully employed in
 the completion of a domes-
tic Improvement, some
 Days ago begun. In the afternoon two of
 us, at the request of the
 Indians, attended a Council
 of the Oneida's, Tuscorora's &
 Stockbridge's together, which
 we found to be on Business of
 their own unconnected with
 ours: The business was con-
ducted with great Decorum
 &
 and Formality and a clear and
 decisive Judgment passed upon
 some disorderly Walkers of unruly spirits who
 were endeavoring to disturb and
 lay waste the internal Govern-
ment of one of these nations. The principle Leaders of
 this Faction are Jacob Konka-
pot, John Konkapot , and Moses
 Sonkankeheh: these Men had
 complained to the Oneida
 Chiefs against their own
 chiefs, viz. the Stockbridge; and
 had requested of them some
 Seperate Lands, that they
 might live independant of
 their Chiefs; who they said
 had required them to sign
 some piece of writing, contrary
 to the Custom of Indians; and
 that they did not understand the
 writing, and therefore would not
 sign it; and because they had
 refused to sign this writing,
 their Chiefs had taken away
 their Lots and had deprived
 them of several national
 priviledges; and divers other
 Charges they had brought against
 them. The Oneida Speaker, Cap
 Peter, opened the Council
 with the customary Formality
 of Thankfulness to the great
 Spirit for being favoured to
 meet Face to Face in that
 Council; then proceeded, in
 substance as follows: Brothers: You remember your
 former situation when you
 were in Distress, having leased
 all your Lands, at old Stock-
bridge in New England, one
 piece after another, to the
 white people, 'till at last
 you had no Land left for
 yourselves. You know; Brothers,
 in this Distress, we your elder
 Brother took pity upon you,
 and gave you this Dish, that
 you might put a spoon into
 it and live; and in order
 that our younger Brother should
 never get such trouble again,
 we made this Dish of steel,
 that it might last forever x,
 and we thought, Brothers, that
 you had put a steel spoon into
 this good Dish; we admire
 then, that our younger Bro-
thers should get to differing
 about the spoon, but we are
 astonished how you should
 breake a steel spoon, so that
 you cannot all get a Living
 together out of this good Dish
 that we have given you; but
x This steel Dish very aptly alluded
 to a clause in their Deed of Gifts,
 barring against their selling or
 leasing to white people. that any of you should pretend
 asto [?] A new Dish to themselves:
 Brothers, we can’t agree to this;
 for if we should give some of
 you a new dish, it may be
 that Dish may be made of
 Wood, and then it will soon
 get broke, and you will
 have no Dish againt: No Brothers,
 we will not do this, but we
 will try to mend your spoon
 for you, so that you may all This wooden Dish represented the
 Disposition of the Complainants
 to sell and lease Lands to the
 white people, for which they
 have been noted. live happily together out of this
 good steel Dish that we have
 given you; and maybe the spoon
 is not broke yet, but only bent
 a little, and we will try to
 straighten it for you: And now
 Brothers, in order to straiten the
 Spoon you must dig a Hole
 in the Ground, and you must
 dig it deep, and in it you must
 bury all these old Contentions
 and Complaints, and you
 must cover them so deep, that
 they can never get up again;
 and then the Spoon will be
 mended; and you will all eat
 together comfortably out of this
 Steel Dish again; Now Brother
 we have done, think of these
 Things; and the Chiefs, and
 young Warriors who complain,
 have liberty to speak for them-
selves. Then the Oneidas and Tus-
cororas withdrew to smoke
 a Pipe, and eat their Din-
ners; During which Time Cap.
 Hendrick repeated the substance
 of the foregoing speech, in the
 Stockbridge Language; to his
 own people; it having been
 delivered in the Oneida Language
 and interpreted into English;
 After which they consulted toge-
ther and not being able to recon-
cile
 cile and restore the Compain-
ants; On the Return of the
 Oneidas and Tuscororas; Cap.
 Hendricks, on behalf of him-
self and his Brother Chiefs,
 made the following Defence;
 viz. Brothers, we are happy
 that the great Spirit has al-
lowed us to smoke a pipe
 together on this Occasion;
 and we understand perfectly
 well all what you have said
 to us: now we will answer
 as far as concerns us. Brothers, it is true we have
 agreed to help one another
 especially when one Brother
 meets with any Difficulty
 the other shall help him
 out; Brothers, All what
 you have said to us and to our
 young Men, we like it well,
 and you know, Brothers, it
 is a common thing for the
 Chiefs of all Nations to
 endeavor to promote the
 Good of their Nation; and
 you also know that they al-
ways receive as a sallery
 therefor the Reproaches
 of some of their people;
 because, that in every nation
 there are some bad people, that
 will not regard good and
 wholesome Rules, but will
 always be wanting to have
 their own way; We have
 such: And now, Bro-
thers, we shall begin to
 speak to the Accusations,
 which those people bring
 against us; and we are glad
 you have had such Wisdom,
 as not to judge in this Mat-
ter without a general Coun
cil, and giving us Leave to
 speak for ourselves, that
 so the Truth may come out;
 The
 The first thing we Shall ob-
serve; they have told you
 Brothers, that we have done
 them Injury; and they say
 that we have let out Lands
 to white people, and that
 we have taken away their
 Lots from them; now Bro-
thers, we deny this; we have
 done no Such Thing: you
 know very well, Brothers,
 that we have maintained our
 Covenant which we
 made with you at Schenec-
tady about this Land, this
 Dish; you are our Witnesses
 that we have never took trouble
 to ourselves, by giving Lease
 of any of this Land to white
 people; and also the great men
 of the State of New York are
 our witnessest; and our writ-
ings testify the same thing;
 By these Things, Brothers, we
 are able to deny this part
 of the Accusation: Brothers, now we will speak
 on the other Hand; these our
 young Men have been trying
 this two years to take away our
 spoon and breake this Dish;
 Some- This appeal to the Great Men of the
 State of New York, had reference, to
 a petition taken in by the Complain
ants for Liberty to sell and lease Lands
 to white people; which was opposed by the Chiefs Sometime, the white people
 will lay hold of the Spoon,
 and try to bend it, and pull
 it this way, and that way;
 and these our young Men will
 join with them, and take
 hold with their Hands, and
 try to bend it; now when
 we saw that our spoon was
 in danger, we the Chiefs
 would take hold; and our
 orderly young Men would take
 hold, and try to bring it back
 again, and to straiten our
 Spoon; to this you are our
 Witnesses, and the great Men
 of
 of the State of New York, are
 our witnesses; And you know,
 Brothers, that we have kept
 our Dish and our Spoon, that
 they are not broke yet, but
 are kept bright; and we in-
tend to keep them bright for
 the use of our Children. Brothers, The next thing we
 shall observe, They say we
 take in Strangers; to this
 we acknowledge; because our
 Covenant we made with you
 was such, as to open a Door
 to take in Strangers of our
 own Colour; Because, Brothers,
 you
 you know, that it is natural
 amongst all nations, to have
 Compassion towards one another;
 for Instance, Brothers, you your-
selves have done Such Thing
 many Years ago; for these
 Tuscororas, who are now at
 this Council, were Strangers,
 and ye took them in, and
 gave them a Dish; and we
 ourselves were also Strangers,
 and ye took us in and gave
 us a Dish; now Brothers, in
 keeping the same Rules among
 us, the Chiefs of our Nation,
 who can find fault with
 us, in that Respect. Brothers, We will observe another
 thing, our young Men have
 told you, that we draw writings,
 and these writings are signed
 by many; and they could not
 understand these writings;
 and therefore would not sign
 them: you also, Brothers, seem
 to be astonished yourselves at these things;
 you say, you do not know how
 these writings should come,
 and why they should be signed:
 Now Brothers, we acknowledge
 we have such writings, and
 if you desire, you shall hear
 these writings, that ye shall
 rightly understand them; but
 before I read you this wri-
ting, we shall let you know,
 that our Chiefs always had
 in their Hearts the welfare
 of the Nation, and often con-
templated what would be
 most for the welfare of the
 whole nation; and about
 twelve years ago, before we
 come to your Country, we found
 it would be for our Welfare, to
 make a Strong Covenant, to
 keep us together, and draw
 writings to keep out Memory
 bright; so long as we maintain
 that agreement, we find it
 do us good, and five years ago,
 since we come to this town,
 we renew that Covenant; and
 since that, now lately, we be-
gin to see the same spirit
 which had made Disturbance
 amongst us before, and which
 must inevitably bring ruin
 both to the spirituals and tem-
porals; therefore the Chiefs
 was alarmed, and believe it
 their Duty to use their law-
ful Endeavour to frustrate
 that Design; and they called
 the Nation together in general
 Council, to consult what shall
 be done, and they agreed to enter
 into
 into Covenant, and draw writings,
 and sign them: now Brothers,
 I will read you the writings: viz.
 Article 1st: The Union of the
 Nation which was established
 at old Stockbridge in the year
 1784 and afterwards renewed
 at different Times is hereby
 again confirmed, that the
 same shall remain inviolable. 2nd. As many as are thus unit-
ed shall abide firm in all the
 good Agreements heretofore
 made in our public Meetings;
 which are recorded in the
 Town Book; but more especially
 in
 in keeping our Lands; and that
 we never should take trouble
 to ourselves, in Endeavouring
 to lease Land to white people.
 3rd. The Said united Inhabitants
 of this town, shall equally par-
take of all the privileges confered
 on us from abroad, and in like
 manner shall equally bear all
 the public Business incum-
bent on the nation. 4th. All those who refuse to
 join in this happy Union
 shall be positively excluded
 from all the aforesaid privileges,
 except preaching and School;
 these two shall remain free as
 usual; yet if any of them should
 see
 see his folly, and disadvantage
 by it, and be disposed to comply
 with the Articles of this Agree-
ment, he or they shall be ad-
mitted, by signing the aforesaid
 agreement to enjoy equal pri-
vileges with the others. 5th. Public meetings shall
 be free and open, the Sachems
 and Chiefs of the Nation shall
 be respected and obeyed in all
 the good Counsels they give. 6th. If any of the members
 of the Union be in distress, his
 Business is to inform his Situ-
ation to the principle men,
 and he shall be afforded all pos-
sible Relief. 7th. And if any man shall do
 a public service he shall
 be entitled to a Reward. 8th. If anyone, whether a mem-
ber of this Union or not, should
 brake either of the Articles of
 this agreement, and persisting
 to do contrary, or making direct
 Opposition against it, as to excite
 others to transgress with him,
 he shall be under penalty
 of the Law. Witness our Hands this
 3rd Day of June 1796. Brothers, you see, and
 understand clearly, what writ-
ings we have drawn, and why
 we should sign these writings;
 that we may know how many
 of us are of one mind: By
 this Agreement you see, that
 we do not take any mans
 property, or do any Injury
 to any; the matter is free
 to every one to act as he pleases;
 if anyone is excluded any
 privileges, he does it himself,
 of his own Choice; but it
 is not the Choice of the
 Chiefs or of the orderly young
 Men: Brothers, we
 have now informed you every
 Thing, particular; now you
 are able to judge who are
 in the fault; whether the
 Chiefs, or these our young men;
 now you must be plain, if
 you find fault with us, tell
 us plainly; we are ready to
 make up, if there is any
 thing against us; but we think
 we can say this, that in stead
 of doing them hurt, we have
 ever endeavoured to promote
 their happiness: Brothers, this is all what
 we have to say at present; only
 one of our young men will speak
 a word to you; if you are willing. Which being admitted, John
 Quinney spoke on Behalf of him-
self, &
 and the rest of the orderly young men, as
 follows; viz. Brother, Chiefs of the Oneida
 and Tuscorora’s, I would inform you, that I believe it is not
 the will of the great Spirit,
 that we the young warriors
 should usurp Authority over
 the our Chiefs; but that it is
 our Duty to obey our Chiefs,
 in all their good Counsels, be-
cause we know, and have ex-
perienced that our Chiefs have
 more wisdom and Knowledge
 than we have; and that they
 have been faithful in promot-
ing our Happiness; so that we
 think it is a great Shame
 for any of us to rise up against
 them; and indeed there are only
 a few who have done such thing;
 now Brothers, we also declare
 that all what our Chiefs have
 related to you, is true: This is all I got to say After a short pause Cap. Peter ,
 the Oneida speaker, replied in
 Substance, as follows. Brothers, We are very glad
 that you have opened your
 Minds to us so fully, that we
 understand clearly all these
 Circumstances that you have
 mentioned; we are glad to
 find
 find that you have maintained
 all our agreements, so that the
 Spoon is safe and bright; and
 all what you have related
 to us, is very agreeable to us;
 and also the writing which you
 have shewn us is good, we
 like it very well; and we do
 not find any fault on your
 side; and we now understand
 where the Blame lies; that
 it lies upon your young men
 there; Brothers, now we hear-
tily thank you Chiefs; and all
 our Chiefs thank you, for the
 Information you have given
 us
 us; and we will now speak
 a word to your orderly young
 Warrior, who spoke a few words
 to us, we like all his words
 well; we are glad to find such
 Disposition in young warriors
 to obey their Chiefs; and we
 are very glad to hear him;
 and we thank him for letting
 us know that there are very
 few young men warriors among you that disobey
 their Chiefs; and we should
 be glad all our young War-
riors would be so disposed; then
 addressing himself to the
 young Men who had com-
plained, he said,
 Brothers
 Brothers, We are sorry to find
 that you yourselves have
 created all these Difficul-
ties that you complain
 of; and now we wish you
 to make up, and Shake
 Hands with your Chiefs
 before our Face, that we
 may see it done, and then
 we will be very glad and
 Satisfied: So Brothers that
 is all we got to say to you:
 The Complainants refused
 to comply with this Advice,
 so the Council broke up; all
 satisfied to appearance, except-
ing these Disturbers of the
 public Tranquility. 18th. This Day attended a
 general Council of the Bro-
thertown Indians, at their
 Town, about 9 miles from
 the Stockbridge Settlement;
 who, as usual, were a long
 Time in getting together; we
 opened our Business without
 any Interpreter, these people
 mostly understanding English,
 and using no other Language
 in their families; after which
 and reading our Certificate
 to them; we desired their pa-
tience, reminding them
 that we had come a great
 way to see them in Love,
 without any prospect of
 worldly Advantage to ourselves,
 and that we were desirous
 they should endeavour
 to still and quiet their
 Minds, as well as their
 Bodies, that they might
 be in a proper Situation
 to hear and understand, if
 we should have any thing
 to say to them: this seems
 to be too little understood
 by these people generally
 where we have been; they
 appear hardly to know how
 to compose themselves many
 Minutes at a Time, unless we
 are speaking to them: but
 we were here favoured with
 a Solid Opportunity; being
 enabled with great planning,
 and Love to labour with them;
 pointing out with Clearness
 the pernicious Effects of the
 Use of Strong Drink; and the
 necessity of avoiding every
 Occasion of Temptation
 thereto; as well as the Ad-
vantage of improving in In-
dustry and Application to their
 Farming, in order to pro-
cure to themselves and their
 families a comfortable Living;
 and
 and also shewing them
 that by Industry and At-
tention to their Business,
 they would be preserved from
 the frequent Temptations,
 which a more indolant and
 wandering Life would expose
 them to, with regard to this
 Bane of their Happiness,
 Strong Liquor. Some of these
 people appear to be indus-
trious, and in general, their
 Dress and manner of Life,
 approaches nearer to that
 of the white people, than
 any of the other Tribes where
 we have been; and notwithstan
 notwithstanding the Gloo-
miness of some of our for-
mer, as well as present
 prospects relative to the
 Concern which we are en-
gaged in, we are in measure
 encouraged to believe in the
 Rectitude of our Undertak-
ing; both from the solid Co-
vering graciously vouchsafed
 at several of our Conferen-
ces, and particularly so this
 Day, to the stilling, if not
 tendering many of the minds
 of these people; and also
 from the Observance of an
 Advancement in Civiliza-
tion amongst these differ-
ent Tribes, in proportion
 to the Serious Exertions
 which have, from time to
 time, been made by white
 people towards some of them,
 for we understand, that, even
 the Oneida’s, who now appear
 to us in a very Rude and
 uncultivated State, were
 still much more so, a few
 year ago, before their Ac-
quaintance with the other
 more civilized Tribes. The Brothertown Indians
 are under the particular
 Care of the State of New York;
 there are three men appointed
 by Government as Commissioners,
 or Superintendents of their Lands
 &c. Two of whom are friends,
 viz. Edward Prior and Thomas
 Eddy, both of New York; the
 third is Col. Floyd , a repu-
table Man, and friend to these
 People: Four of these In-
dians, viz. David Fowler , John
 Toohie, John Skesuck , and Isaac
 Wauby, have received Com-
missions of the Peace from
 Government; and they have
 a Counsellor at Law, ap-
pointed for their Assistance
 in difficult Cases; viz. Joseph
 Herkland. They consist
 of about 56 Families, have
 9900 Acres of Land, which is
 secured to them by Law, in
 such a Manner, that no
 Individual of them has power
 to sell or lease any part of
 it to white people; but it
 is divided into Lots, some of an
 hundred & some of fifty acres,
 and they possess their Land
 and other Things as distinct
 and private property; They
 received this Land, in the first
 place, with considerable more,
 by Gift from the Oneidas; who
 afterwards sold the whole,
 with other Lands, to the State
 of New-York; but the State
 discovering the prior Right
 of the Brothertown’s, repurchased
 the greater part of them, and
 secure the above quantity,
 in manner aforesaid: They have one Saw mill
 on their Land, which is private
 property, and there is a grist-
mill belonging to white peo-
ple within about two miles
 of
 of the Center of their Build-
ings; they have some good
 Cattle, Cows & working Oxen;
 and they have £800 a year
 coming in from the State
 of New-York; as Interest
 for the purchase Money of
 their Lands: That they ap-
pear to be in a very promis-
ing way to do well as to world-
ly Affairs, if their Industry
 & Sobriety keep Pace with
 their Knowledge and Op-
portunity. 19th. Being first Day, and un-
derstanding these people
 made
 made a practice of meeting
 together to worship, without
 any Hireling, or set Minister,
 we felt our Minds easy to attend
 with them; which we accordingly
 did; and altho’ they conformed
 to our Manner, yet we had
 reason to believe Silence was
 not very acceptable to them; nor
 their Minds sensible of true
 inward Stillness and Quietude
 in worship; their manner
 being, for some or other of
 them, either Man or woman,
 to be almost Constantly em-
ployed in preaching, praying,
 singing of Psalms or some
 other outward and visible Acts
 of
 of Devotion. 20th. This morning we sepe-
rated; three of our number
 going for fort Schuyler, to look
 after our Goods, and to wait
 on some man in that Neigh-
bourhood, to whom we had a
 Letter of Credit, whilst the
 Remainder of our Company
 concluded to make themselves
 better acquainted with the Situ-
ation and Circumstances of
 these people, by paying
 them a friendly Visit in
 their Cottages; in which
 Service the Remainder
 of this Day was employed, to
 the mutual Satisfaction
 of the Indians & ourselves. 21st. The forepart of this
 Day concluded our friendly
 Visit to the families of the
 Brothertown’s, having missed
 but two or three in their
 whole settlement: After
 which, upon a Consultation
 together, we united in Judgment
 with that of Col. Floyd , here-
tofore noted in these minutes:
 viz. That these people were
 in a promising way to live
 comfortably; and that they
 stood in no absolute need of
 any present assistance, in the
 way of farming Utensils &c.- After Dinner took our Leave of
 these people, who had generally
 expressed their Satisfaction and
 thankfulness, for the brotherly
 freedom we had manifested
 amongst them in visiting them
 in their Houses; then proceeded
 to our Lodgings at Stockbridge;
 where we arrived in the evening. 22nd. This Day about noon met
 at Oneida Town, at John Sho-
nandoah’s with our friends who
 had left us two Days since to
 go to fort Schuyler; they inform,
 that they have done the Busi-
ness for which they went; but
 have heard no Tidings of Jacob
 Taylor: We now concluded it
 necessary to make ourselves better
 acquainted with the different
 Situations of the Country belonging
 to this Tribe, in order to form
 some Idea where of the best
 Place to make our Settlement;
 and a place about four Miles
 from this being recommended
 to us, we proceeded to view it; and
 after examining the nature
 of the Soil, situation &c. we
 United in Opinion that
 it was not a suitable place
 for our purpose: Here four
 of us took up our Lodgings at
 the House of a white Man,
 who had settled on an hundred
 Acres of the Indian Lands, under
 a
 a Licence from Government,
 given to his Brother, who is
 Black smith for that Nation:
 This House being on the great
 Road leading to the Genesee
 Country, and keeping Liquor
 and other things to sell, is be-
come a place of much Re-
sort; and we doubt not much
 to the Advantage of the Indians,
 who we understand are uneasy
 with his Conduct: We had
 a very uncomfortable Night;
 and left there in the morning,
 being, 23rd. Went to Shonandoah’s ,
 this being at the principal
 Town, and particularly viewed
 the
 the adjoining Lands; after
 which united in believing
 somewhere near this place,
 the most suitable, on divers
 accounts, for our Stand: we then
 proceeded to our Lodgings at
 Stockbridge: and in the afternoon,
 confered together, and entered
 upon a plan the Digestion of
 a plan for our Settlement. 24th. Resumed the Consideration
 of our plan of a Settlement at
 Oneida; and after several
 Conferences, in which the
 weight and Importance of our
 Undertaking was very sensibly
 felt; and much Harmony and
 brotherly condescension experienced,
 we
 we were enabled to unitedly a-
gree on the following proposi-
tions to the Oneida Nation. viz. Brothers of the Oneida Nation,
 You now know that we are sent
 to you by your old Friends, the
 people called Quakers, of Pennsylvania and
 parts adjacent, not merely to
 make you presents, which
 would soon be spent; leaving you
 poor and needy; but to shew
 you how the white people
 manage to raise a great deal
 of Food and Clothing off of a
 little Land, that you may
 become able to support your-
selves, and your Children
 comfortably without being
 beholden to any body, and have
 something to share for the old
 and infirm, as well as to lay
 by, against Times of Scarcity. Brothers, remember that we have
 left all that was dear to us at
 home, not to get your Lands
 from you, or any thing that
 is yours; but to visit you, and
 to stay with you, if happily
 we may put you in the way
 to enjoy the manifested Blessings
 of the all bountiful Creator;
 now we have seen and reflected
 upon your Situation, and consult-
ed one another for the future
 prosperity of your whole Nation
 and
 and the three Tribes you have
 kindly permitted to settle on
 your Lands; and we have put
 our Conclusions in writing,
 that it may be known what
 we are willing to undertake for
 you, and what we desire you
 to do towards it yourselves; for
 we mean to set you a clear ex-
ample if you will agree to follow it. Brothers, We trust that we
 possess your Confidence un-
mixed with any Jealousy and
 fears; and we request you to
 listen patiently and attentive-
ly to what we are a going to
 propose
 propose to you, for your own
 Good; and if any part of it
 displeases you, tell us so and
 we will reconsider it. Brothers, Three of our Friends
 intend to stay with you for
 these purposes, namely Ja-
cob Taylor, Henry Simmons ,
 and Enoch Walker ; but they
 are not bound to remain
 by any thing but good Will;
 Neither are they obliged to
 work more than they think
 necessary; nor to be altogether
 amongst you, as they are to go
 sometimes to Tuscorora, Stock-
bridge, and Brothertown: We
 earnestly desire, that none
 of you may discourage them
 by
 by Swearing, Idleness, Drunken-
ness, or misbehavior, for these
 things are very disagreeable
 to us; as you know they are
 to the good Spirit. Brothers, We must have some
 Land to work upon; and we should
 like to begin upon that part
 of the Common which lies
 west of the Path from Shonan-
doah’s to Stockbridge, South
 of the Road to Onondago,
 East of the Boundaries of
 the old Fort, and north of
 Shanandoah Creek, excepting
 any part thereof now occu-
pied by your Families. Brothers, If we think there is
 Encouragement to undertake
 more another year, we shall
 ask you for it seasonably, and
 agree together where it shall
 be. Brothers, You know it is hard-
ly practicable for all to learn
 at once together; we will begin
 with a few, who much stick
 to the work; the rest will see
 how they get forward, and
 be ready to take their turn
 when it comes round; we want
 to engage five or eight Sober
 young Men as Apprentices
 till next Spring. Brothers,
 We suppose you will
 be willing, that we should feed
 our Horses, Cattle &c. upon
 the Commons, and that
 you will allow us some
 Suitable grass Lots to provide
 Hay for them in the winter;
 to cut fire-wood, railing, and
 Timber for building in your
 Woods; have the use of the Saw-
mill, and Smith’s shop, when
 we have occasion for them;
 and sometimes work your
 Horses and Oxen when
 they are not wanted by you. Brothers,
 You are to under-
stand that our Friends are
 to live plentifully, as their
 own people do at home,
 and their live stock are
 also to be kept by the pro-
duce of their Labour in the
 first place; then the eighth
 part of the Remainder is
 to reserved for the relief
 of your old Men” and infirm
 people; and the rest is to be
 divided amongst the young
 Indian Apprentices; that they
 may enjoy the fruit of
 their Labour; and have
 some-
 something to begin with
 for themselves, when other
 Apprentices are taken in
 their Stead; provided they
 behave well; but in case
 of continued Idleness, Drun-
kenness, Swearing, or other
 Misbehavior in any
 of them, our friends must
 not keep bad Company;
 and we request you to appoint
 three of your Chiefs to unite
 with our Friends as Judges,
 that if four of them agree,
 the person offending may
 be justly discharged. Brothers, Our stay amongst you
 will depend upon several
 Circumstances, and particu-
larly the Encouragement we
 may have to hope that your
 Nation will become, in time
 Sober, industrious and frugal,
 laying up something for
 themselves against Sickness
 and old Age: Whenever we
 leave you, the improvements
 we make on your Lands
 will belong to you; but the
 Cattle and other Things we
 bring with us, we shall con-
sider as our own. Joseph Sansom James Cooper Henry Simmons John O'eirn Enoch Walker Isaiah Rowland 25th. After copying the above
 propositions it was agreed that
 three of our Number should
 go to the Oneida Town, collect
 as many of their Chiefs
 together as they conveniently
 could; read and explain the
 above propositions to them;
 and leave them under their
 Consideration; informing
 them that we should expect
 to meet a general Council
 of their Chiefs and principle
 Men on Second Day the 27th.
 in order to fully consider,
 and agree upon the Several
 particulars mentioned in Said
 propositions. The rest of our Company
 were employed in writing, and
 paying a friendly Visit to Some
 of the Families of the Stock-
bridge’s: which was to mu-
tual Satisfaction. 26th. Being first Day, we kept
 together at our Lodgings, and
 had a Time of private retire-
ment, which was somewhat
 trying; and we hope excited
 profitable self examination
 into the Cause. 27th. This morning as we
 were preparing to go to the
 Oneida Town, agreeable to
 the Conclusions of seventh
 Day
 Day last, we received a Letter
 from Nicholas Schuisick Chief
 of the Tuscorora’s informing
 that we need not go to Oneida
 this Day, for their Chiefs in-
tended to come to us at Stockbridge,
 we were at a loss to understand
 the Motives for this Change in
 the State of our Business; but
 could readily perceive Patience
 to be a very necessary Attainment
 whilst we have any Concerns to
 transact with these people;
 We therefore concluded to wait
 for their Reception at our Lodg-
ings; which we accordingly
 did, but heard no more of them
 this Day. 28th. This morning dispatched
 a Runner to Oneida Town, to
 bring us Word of the Reason of
 our Disappointment yesterday;
 and also to know when and
 where we might soonest
 meet them in Council: About Eleven OClock our
 Messenger returned, brought
 us word that the Oneida Chiefs
 went yesterday to Fort Stan-
wick to meet the State Com-
missioners relative to some
 Land which they had sold,
 and they they intended to
 come to us at Stockbridge,
 after
 after their Return; which
 is expected this Evening: so
 that it appears we can have
 no Opportunity with them
 before tomorrow Morning. 29th. Notwithstanding the
 Information of yesterday re-
specting the Oneida Chiefs
 coming to us, we thought it
 best to go to them; and accord-
ingly we went to Schonandoah 
 one of their Chiefs, where we
 before met; but to our Surprise,
 found no preparation making
 either to receive us there, or
 to come to us at Stockbridge:~
 One of us went after Jacob
 Reed, their Interpreter, who
 when he was come, together
 with the Chief Schonandoah ,
 concluded to try to collect
 the most of their Chiefs to-
gether or at least pretended
 so to us; and that they had
 dispatched Runners for that
 purpose: we waited ‘till about
 two or three OClock; when we
 were informed, they were out at
 work, and could not be collected
 this Day: but that they would
 meet early tomorrow Morning:
 this was somewhat trying;
 and
 and notwithstanding we have
 met with various Instances,
 in each of these Tribes, of un-
feigned Regard and Affection,
 yet it appeared now Seasonable
 to shew some marks of the
 Discouragements naturally
 consiquent on the present
 seeming Ingratitude; and
 to hint to them our Sensibility
 of such Treatment; which, it
 is hoped, will have some effect
 upon their minds: We
 then agreed to meet them tomor-
row morning; and returned
 to our Lodgings, at Captain Hendricks : In the Evening resumed the 
 Consideration of some propositi-
ons to the Stockbridge Nation,
 which at Intervals of Leisure,
 for Several Days past had been
 seriously before us: We now unit-
edly concluded upon the follow-
ing. Viz. Brothers of the Stockbridge Nation,
 we are very glad to find, that
 through the Blessing of the
 great Spirit, and your honest
 Industry, and frugal Sobriety,
 you may soon be in a way to
 live comfortably, without being
 beholden to anybody for help. Brothers, As you cannot but
 thankfully acknowledge this
 to
 to be the Case with your
 Nation in general; and as you
 know we want to help many
 of your Indian Brothers a
 little, who stand in much
 more need than you do; we
 trust you will not think
 hard of us, if we do not do
 a great deal for you at this
 time: But, Brothers, in
 order to encourage you to be
 Still more industrious and
 Saving, and to set a good Exam-
ple to your indian Brothers
 and neighbors, who are far
 behind you in point of Civil-
ization, we have agreed to help
 you a little, as follows; Brothers,
 We agree to give you
 our Smith’s Tools all complete;
 and one of our Friends can instruct
 you a little in using them; and
 also a share of our Implements
 of Husbandry, which we expect
 up by our Friend Jacob Taylor ,
 whom we left behind, in order to
 bring them up by water. Brothers, We also are willing to en-
courage you in building a Grist
 Mill, by agreeing to advance three
 Dollars to your one, of all the mo
ney actually to be paid for materi-
als, mechanical Labour, and victu
aling the Workmen; you finding
 the
 the Timber, and delivering
 it on the Spot, and doing such
 other parts of the Business
 as you may be capable of, with-
out bringing it into the gene-
ral Charge, of which we have
 agreed to pay three fourths:
 We also agree that the 100 Dol.
 lent to Captain Hendrick by our
 Committee, together with 40
 Dollars, lent to John Serjant , by
 us for the use of your Nations,
 shall be considered as a part
 of this Advance; and left
 in your Hands for the aforesaid
 purpose: provided always,
 that
 if the Government sh
 at any time pay the Expen
 of said Mill, agreeable to an
 Article which you say is con
tained in a late Treaty, then, in
 that Case you are to refund to
 our Committee all and every
 part of the Advance made by
 us towards said Mill. And we propose our Friends
 Jacob Taylor and Enoch Walker 
 to take the special Care and Su-
perintendence of building said
 Mill, without making any
 Change on you for their Trou-
ble: and we further propose,
 that when said Mill is
 erected, that you call a general
 Council, and choose a Suitable
 man amongst yourselves to
 take the Care of this Mill,
 and to grind all your Grain;
 and to keep the Mill in Or-
der; and that you agree on
 some certain and fixed pro-
portion for this man to 
 have, out of every Grist that
 shall be ground, sufficient
 to pay him well for his Trouble
 Time and Trouble, and to ena-
ble him to keep the Mill in
 good repair; which he ought
 to do at his own Expense, out
 of his profits which you allow
 him: and we further propose,
 that you admit your Brother,
 the Tuscarora’s, to enjoy a part
 of the Advantages of this mill. Brothers, We also to propose to
 encourage you, in keeping
 up a School for the Education
 of your Children, by agreeing to
 pay a part of the Salary to your
 former Master, John Quinney ,
 if he will agree again to teach
 we are willing to pay 25 Dol-
lars a Quarter, for our year, at
 least, if you will agree to make
 up as much more as to encourage
 him to keep steadily: Our Friends
 who stay amongst you, will
 pay the Money punctually,
 when a Certificate is produced
 to them signed by two our your
 Chiefs, certifying that the School
 has been kept steadily for the
 Length of Time above mentioned
 for Payments; the Tuscorora’s
 being admitted to partake e-
qually of the Advantages of
 this School. Brothers, We further propose,
 for your Encouragement in
 Agriculture, Industry &c. that,
 for the Term of two years from
 the third month next, we will
 give the following Premiums
 to any Individual Indian of
 the Stockbridge or Tuscorora
 Nations, living in this Reser-
vation, upon the Conditions
 herein after mentioned 1st. For every 50 Bushels of
 Wheat raised in any one year
 within Said Term, by any
 one Farmer, of either of these
 two Nations, on his own Land,
 not worked by white people,
 the Sum of two Dollars. 2nd. For every 100 Bushels of
 Indian Corn, raised in like
 Manner aforesaid, the Sum of
 two Dollars. 3rd. For every 100 Bush. of Pota-
toes raised as aforesaid, the
 Sum of one Dollar & an half. 4th. For every three Tons of hay
 raised as aforesaid, and put
 into a Stack or Barn, the Sum
 of two Dollars. 5th. For every 12 yards of linnen
 Cloth made by and Indian Woman
 out of Flax raised on her, or her
 Husband’s Land, and spun in
 her own House, the Sum of one
 Dollar, to be paid to the woman. 6th. For every 12 yards, of
 Wollen Cloth, made as aforesaid
 out of the Wool of her own, or
 her Husband’s Sheep, spun
 in like Manner aforesaid
 the Sum of one Dollar, to be
 paid to the woman.* Now the Conditions of ob-
taining the above premiums are, *Note, The Stockbridges having an
 Inclination to apply a part of their
 Annual Income from Government,
 to the Encouragement of Industry that the person applying,
 shall produce a Certificate
 signed, at least, by two of the Chiefs
 of his or her particular Tribe,
 certifying the particular Quan-
tity of Grain, Cloth &c. for which
 Said premium shall be demand-
ed, and that it was raised or made
 in the manner above particularly
 specified; and also that the appli-
cant has not, to the best of their
 knowledge, been intoxicated with
 Strong Drink, at least, for the
 Space of one full year before
 such Application be made. 
 by premiums, defined one of us to draw
 them a plan for that purpose; which
 gave rise to the above; this will ac-
count for the smallness of the Sums
 annexed to each Article. And we further propose,
 that any man or woman of
 these two nations, by producing
 a Certificate from two of the
 Chiefs as aforesaid, that he or
 she is highest or foremost in
 any one or more of the above
 particulars, of any other person
 in that nation, he or she shall
 be entitled to a double premium
 for the particular in which
 he or she shall be so highest
 or foremost. And our Friends Jacob
 Taylor, and Henry Simmons ,
 and Enoch Walker are hereby
 authorized, and desired to pay
 the above mentioned premi-
ums, agreeable to what is herein
 above particularly mentioned. Sixth mo 29th. 1796. John Peirce James Cooper Joseph Sansom Isaiah Rowland Henry Symmons Enoch Walker 30th. Again attended the Oneida
 Council, agreeable to the Conclusi-
on of yesterday; met at Schonan-
doah’s between 10 & 11 OClock, and
 Jacob Taylor being arrived this morning attended
 with us; we found the Chiefs &c.
 Collected and waiting for us; so that
 we soon got to Business: Which
 was opened by their speaking
 particularly to our propositions
 of the 25th. Instant, and left
 under their Confederation;
 to the following Effect; viz. Brothers, We find no Difficulty
 in accepting your proposals,
 in anything but the place
 you choose. See 5th. Article.
 many of us are against part-
ing with any of our Commons,
 because we have hardly pasture
 enough for our Cattle now, and
 if we lessen it, they will be famish-
ed, and brake down our fences to
 get at our Corn. Besides which
 we are afraid our young men
 will disturb you there, some-
times when they get in Liquor. Brothers, We think it right to
 propose another place to you,
 which we think will suit you
 better: we will go and shew it
 to you. Upon this the Spot was
 viewed, and mutually agreed
 to, bounded as follows; Beginning
 at a Gut or Run South, South
east of Anthony Shononghleya’s 
 House, and running nearly South
 by a couple of noted trees to Shan-
andoah Creek, extending eastward
 into the woods without Limi-
tation; and one of their Chiefs
 Anthony Shononghleya being
 willing to rent his house, which
 appeared in a good Degree suit-
able for our purpose; we agreed
 to rent it at 20 Dollars a year
 as long as we should stay in this
 Country under the present Con-
cern, paying him one years Rent
 down and covenanting to make
 some Repairs: This House is
 Frame, about 38 feet by 18, one
 story high; and with a small
 Expense will be pretty warm
 and comfortable; and is well
 situated, on an Eminence, com-
manding a view of nearly all
 the aforesaid Trait. They next objected to a part
 of the eighth Article relative
 to the Oxen and Horses and
 Oxen being worked, saying, “We
 have but two pair of Oxen be-
longs to the Town, and some bo-
dy is always using them, but
 therefore we can’t spare them;
 but there is a pair of Steers,
 you may have them to break
 and work: and our Horses we
 can’t spare them; because they
 a'n't good for anything to work. And as to they Hay you asked
 us about, say they, you may
 have as much as you want
 at such and such certain
 Flats, about three miles off,
 which they described to us, and
 which several of our Company
 had seen and believed to be good.
 The above being all the
 Variations they wished to
 make from our proposals;
 we agreed to the Amendments;
 and they appointed John Scho-
nandoah, Anthony Shononghleya ,
 and Nicholas Shagorakorongo to
 unite with our Friends agree-
able to the 9th. Article. We then desired the Copy
 we had given them of our
 proposals in order to insert
 on them the foregoing Excep-
tions and amendments; to
 the End that we might dearly
 understand one another; and
 that we might have it all
 in writing to keep our Memo-
ries bright: we then broke
 up, after informing them
 that we should expect one
 more general Meeting with
 them before we went away,
 which we wished their Women
 and young people to generally
 to attend. We next executed a memo-
randum of agreement between
 Anthony Shononghleya and our
 Friends respecting the House,
 paid him the 20 Dollars for
 the first years Rent, took his
 Reecit therefor; and returned
 to our Lodgings at Cap. Hendricks Seventh mo. 1st. Early this
 Morning three of our Num-
ber set off for fort Schuyler, &
 that Neighbourhood, in order
 to buy a pair of Oxen, and make
 some other necessary prepara-
tions for our new Settlement;
 and to endeavor to get up some
 of our Good; whilst others were
 employed in writing, and arang-
ing different parts of our
 Business; and a proposition
 for the writing of a Letter of
 general Information to our
 Committee at Philadelphia
 being made, the Expediency
 thereof was agreed to, and our
 Essay made. 2nd. Resumed our writing
 and Arangements; and the
 Essay of a general Letter being
 read and considered, was united
 with, and transcribed; being
 as follows: viz. Stockbridge 7th. mo. 1st. 1796 Dear Friends, We are all pretty well
 at present, and through the
 Blessing of Superintending Good-
ness, have been mostly preserved
 in a good Degree so, since we
 left home, tho’ not without some
 Exceptions: We feel ourselves now
 a little revived in our spirits, by
 the arrival of our friend Jacob Taylor ; of
 whom we had heard nothing
 since we left home, ‘till he came
 to us yesterday, at Stockbridge:
 It appears he has had a safe,
 tho’ tedious passage; has safely
 landed, at fort Schuyler about
 22 Miles from this place, all
 the Goods committed to his
 Care: and notwithstanding
 we have been between two
 and
 and three weeks amongst the
 different Tribes in the Oneida
 Reservation, we have not been
 able, with the greatest Assiduity
 and Address that we have been
 capable of, to bring our Business
 into any tolerable State of fix-
edness and arangement until
 the present Time; for we have
 indeed found it tedious, to a
 trying Degree, in doing Busi-
ness with these people. We have attended general
 Councils of the Stockbridge,
 Oneida, Tuscorora, and Brother-
town’s, as there are these four
 distinct Tribes living on this
 Reservation; and have spared
 no reasonable pains to make
 our-
 ourselves thoroughly acquainted
 with their individual and
 relative Situations in various
 respects; having visited many
 of them in their private
 Huts: And as we have kept
 regular Minutes of our
 proceedings since our Arival
 in this Country, which was
 on the 11th. of last month, we
 hope, if favoured to get home,
 to have the Satisfaction of
 laying them before you:
 In the mean time, trust it
 will be acceptable to you
 to receive the following Sum-
mary of our Sense of things here. The Brothertown's are a mixed
 people from various parts of
 the eastern Governments, set-
tled here on a Tract of Land giv-
en to them by the Oneida’s, and
 forming themselves into a kind
 of national Compact under
 the Appellation of Brothers,
 and calling their Settlement
 by the Name of Brothertown,
 they are considered as a distinct
 Tribe under that Name. They consist of about 56 Fa-
milies, have 9900 Acres of
 Land now, but their Original
 Gift from the Oneida’s was
 much more, which has been
 reduced, much through their
 own mismanagement, by
 leasing &c. to the white peo-
ple, ‘till Government out
 of friendship to them, took
 notice of their Situation, pur-
chased the greater part of their
 Tract, and secured the above
 Quantity to them by Law, in
 Such a manner that no Indi-
vidual of them has a right
 to sell or lease any part of
 it to white people;* but it
 is divided into Lots of different
 *Note. The Information in minute, of the
 18th of last mo. p. 97. respecting the Oneida’s
 selling this Land to the State of New York,
 was obtained after writing this Letter,
 and added to that minute; yet does
 not contradict the Reason here given
 for the Loss of their Lands; the State Sizes, which they possess, as
 they do other Things, as distinct
 and private property: They
 have one Sawmill on their Land,
 which is private Property; and
 there is a Grist Mill belonging
 to white people about two or
 three Miles from the Center
 of their Buildings; they have
 some good Cattle, Cows and working
 Oxen, and about ₤800 a year com-
ing in from Government; so that
 they seem to be in a promising
 way to live comfortably, being
 under
 having acknowledged the prior right
 of the Brothertown’s, they might cer-
tainly have retained their whole
 Land, had not their own Imprudence
 rendered the above measure eligible. under the particular Care
 and Superintendence of three
 Men reputable Men ap-
pointed by Government, two
 of whom are friends of New-
 York, T. Eddy and E. Prior , to-
gether with Col. Floyd , who
 appears a true friend to them,
 and with whom we have had
 a very satisfactory Conference,
 relative to our Business, par-
ticularly, as far as it concerned
 this Tribe; and after visiting
 them in general Council, &
 in many of their private
 private Habitations, we
 united with the aforesaid Col.
 Floyd, in believing this Tribe
 not necessarily objects of Friends
 Help at this Time, in the way
 of Farming Utensils &c. they being
 well provided for, by their Super-
intendants, out of their Annual
 Sum aforesaid. The Stockbridge Indians con-
sist of about 60 Families, and
 300 Individuals, these are not
 of the Six Nations, but came
 generally from a place called
 Stockbridge in New England,
 in the year 1784: They pos-
sess 23040 Acres of Land, of a
 good Quality, given to them by
 the Oneida’s, and which they
 divide into 100 Acre Lots,
 and every family has one
 Lot, and every Son is to have
 a
 a Lot laid off by a Settled Order
 ‘till the whole is occupied;
 they have a Sawmill, and
 sundry other Things which
 they enjoy in common; but
 they possess their Land &
 the fruits of it, as distinct
 and private Property; but
 no Individual can sell or
 lease Land to the white people;
 they have 350 Dollars a
 year coming in from General
 Government; but they are
 yet in debt for their Saw-
mill: but, in general they
 also appear in a promising
 way
 way to live comfortably in a
 few years, having made con-
siderable Improvements in
 farming &c. tho’ they have
 great room still to improve,
 especially in Industry: – We united in believing this
 not to be the place to make
 our Settlement, tho’ the people
 appear to us much more deserv-
ing than the Oneida’s, the
 place we have made choise
 of for that purpose: we
 nevertheless thought it right
 to give them Some Encourage-
ment to move forward, and
 set a good Example to their
 less
 less civilized Neighbors;
 we therefore agreed to give
 them our Smiths Tools,
 besides their Share of the
 Implements of Husbandry;
 and to encourage them in keep-
ing up their School, (as they
 have a pretty suitable Master
 amongst themselves) by agree
ing to pay 25 Dollars a quar-
ter as part of his Salary for
 one year at least: and we have
 also agreed to give them some
 assistance in building a Grist
 Mill upon certain stipulated
 Conditions, too lengthy to be par-
ticularly mentioned in this
 Letter
 Letter, together with several
 small conditional premiums
 as Encouragement to Industry
 and Sobriety. The Tuscorora’s are an in-
considerable Remnant of that
 Tribe, the main Body of them
 being removed, as we are informed,
 to grand River: They consist
 of about 12 Families, appear
 very poor and heartless, almost
 without a Leader and without
 Hope: we propose to consider
 them largely in the Distribu-
tion of the property sent up;
 and have considered them in
 the aforesaid proposals to the
 Stockbridge, they living on the
 Oneida Lands within about
 one mile and an half of Cap.
 Hendricks. The Oneida’s are, by far the
 most considerable nation, being
 the Original proprietors of
 all this part of the Country;
 They consist of between six
 and seven hundred Individuals,
 have yet a large quanty of
 Land of a good Quality, tho’ they
 are frequently making it
 less by Sales to Government,
 one of which is now a surveying,
 and has been some in our way,
 by engaging their Attention.
 They appear to be a declin-
ing People, not only in their
 Land going one piece after
 another; but we are informed
 that they actually decrease in
 Numbers; and there is reason
 to believe they will continue
 so to do, unless some reform
 can be happily effected a-
mongst them: They are
 in a much less civilized
 State than the Stockbridge
 or Brothertown’s: they have
 many horses and some Cattle;
 a Sawmill, and Smith’s
 Shop, with a smith hired
 by the year, by Government;
 and about 700 Dollars a
 year from general Government,
 and about 5000 from the
 State of New-York. Here
 we
 we have unitedly agreed
 to make our Settlement,
 and have agreed with them
 respecting the place, as well
 as the Terms and Conditions;
 which we hope is now pretty
 clearly understood by them
 and us; but we have had
 divers Meetings with them
 on the Occasion, and in seve-
ral Respects a trying Time,
 before we could get our plan
 fully established: We have
 a considerable Tract of un-
cultivated Land now allotted
 to us near the Center of
 their Settlement, and
 about four miles from Stock-
bridge, and ten or twelve from
 Brothertown: We have also rent
 a House in a good Situation
 commanding a view of nearly
 all our Tract; it is a frame
 Building about 22 by 18 one
 story high, with two Rooms
 down stairs, and a good Loft;
 and with a small Expence
 can be made a comfortable
 Dwelling: It belonged to one
 of their Chiefs, who to oblige
 us, as well as in consideration
 of a handsome Rent, has a-
greed to move out and give
 us possession next Second
 Day
 Day: The Obtaining of this
 House we considered as a
 favorable Circumstance
 to our Business. Dear Friends, neither the
 Room nor Leisure allotted for
 this Letter will admit the
 Insertion of the various
 propositions and conclu-
sions which have occured
 relative to this Settlement,
 we must ask your patience
 for the particulars until
 we are able to furnish you
 with our Minutes. Three of our Friends are
 this Day gone out for fort
 Schuyler and that Neighbour-
hood in order to purchase Ox
en, and some other Necessaries,
 for our new Settlement, and
 to attend to getting some of
 our Goods up; so that we have
 a Hope to see our Friends
 settled in their new Habi-
tation by secondthird Day next,
 and that we shall be able
 to satisfactorily leave them
 in a couple of Days after. We have been kindly received
 by the Indians in general, and
 have received many marks
 of unfeigned Regard and Af-
fection amongst them; and
 have had the Satisfaction to
 observe a very agreeable
 Disposition amongst the
 white Inhabitants on the
 frontiers, relative to the In-
dians and our Concern; and
 we may thankfully acknow-
ledge, that in several of our
 public Counsels in particular,
 we have been graciously favoured
 with the overshadowing wrong
 of holy Help to our humble
 Encouragement; and to the
 Strengthening of our minds in
 the Belief of the rectitude of
 this Concern; and that its
 Origin is from the Univer-
sal Father of the great family
 of
 of mankind; who cannot but
 be graciously mindful of what-
soever his Hand hath made;
 yet we have had some pretty
 close and Exercising Seasons
 to pass through, more parti-
cularly amongst the Oneida’s;
 who had suffered their Expec-
tations to be raised to an un-
reasonable Height before
 our arrival; so that our pro-
posals, especially at the first,
 instead of exciting Gratitude,
 appeared rather to be received
 with those Sensations attendant
 on disappointed Expectations. We expect to move towards
 Conandarque, taking two small
 Tribes on our way; viz.
 Onondago, about 30 miles
 from Oneida; and Cayuga,
 about 30 further; by the
 foregoing friends will be
 able to form some Idea, when
 we may be expected to reach
 Conandarque; at which
 place we should be very glad
 to hear from our Friends,
 not having received any In-
structions since we left home. With near Love and
 affection to you and our
 friends and Connections in
 general we remain, &c. John Peirce Isaiah Rowland James Cooper Enoch Walker Joseph Sansom In the afternoon of this Day
 we attended a farewell Council
 of the Tuscorora’s, which was
 opened by informing them in
 what Respects we had considered
 them in our propositions to
 the Stockbridge’s, and also that
 we meant to give them a
 large Share, in proportion
 to their numbers, of the Goods
 which we should have to divide,
 after which we were favoured
 renewedly to open before their
 view the Serious necessity of
 a Change in their Manner
 of Life; together with the
 probability that as they increas-
 ed in Industry and Sobriety,
 they would partake more
 plentifully of the Blessings
 of the great Spirit, both in
 Temporals and Spirituals: They appeared in a good
 Degree serious; and Nicholas
 Schusick, their Chief, answered
 on Behalf of the whole, in
 Substance, as follows, viz. “Brothers, We sha’nt say much,
 only a few words, we thank
 the great Spirit, that has put
 it into your Hearts to come
 so far to see us: We acknowledge
 that we are poor, and weak &
 ignorant, and don’t do as we
 ought
 ought to do; but we have some
 Feelings; and we heartily thank
 you for your good Advice, and
 help to poor Indians, both for
 our Bodies and for our Souls:
 and we promise you, we will
 try to follow your advice; and
 we are glad you are going to
 leave some of your friends
 with us, that they may in-
struct us, and put us in
 Mind of your words: for though
 we desire to do what you have
 told us , but we are weak and
 should forget; but now they
 will put us in mind, and
 we hope we shall improve. In the Evening two of our
 friends, who went yesterday to
 the white Settlements, returned,
 and informed, that they have
 bought Oxen, a Cart and some
 other necessaries, and that
 the other Friend was gone
 to Brothertown, in Company
 with our friend Joshua Evans ,
 whom they met with at fort
 Schuyler. They also inform of the fol-
lowing melancholy Accident which
 happened last Evening at the
 aforesaid fort Schuyler: The
 House of one Jonston an
 Innkeeper, who had been
 settled there about two years,
 took fire about Eleven OClock
 at Night, and in less than an
 Hour was burnt to the Ground;
 together with much of the pro-
perty in it; and what was still
 abundantly more trying, one
 of his Daughters a Child of
 about twelve years of Age
 also perished in the Flames:
 This House was a great Re-
ceptacle for Travelers, many
 of whom were now here; but
 our Friend who lodged in this
 Village, was fortunately at
 the Adjoining Inn; but saw
 the frightful Scene. The poor Child who suffered,
 had
 had been imprudently left
 up the last in the House; and
 going to Bed in the Garret, where
 they deposited their flax and
 Tow, and carrying a Candle
 with her, this Accident is
 easily accounted for: There
 were two other Children in
 the Garret, one of which
 ran through the Flames &
 got safely down, being only
 a little singed about the
 Head & face; the other had
 the Composure to recollect
 that the Garret Floor was
 loose, and therefore lifted up
 one of the Boards and sliped
 down, and was saved; but the
 poor Child who had been in-
strumental to the Scene was so
 confused, as not to know how
 to get down, altho’ her Brother
 had opened the Way: and what
 was more extraordinary the
 poor Mother, reflecting on the
 desperate Situation of her Child,
 most earnestly endeavoured to
 press the same on the Men, with the
 possibility of relieving her, by
 means of the floor being loose;
 but the Confusion was so great,
 that all were deaf to her most
 moving Entreaties; even the
 Child’s Father himself. 3rd. This being first Day it
 was considered whether we
 should all go to Brothertown
 to meet our aforesaid Friend
 Joshua Evans , but resulted
 in the negative, that as we
 had made a practice of hold-
ing Meetings regularly amongst
 ourselves, on this Day, it was
 thought best not to decline
 it on the present Occasion;
 and therefore concluded, that
 one of us only should go to
 Brothertown, to give our Said
 Friend a welcome, and if con-
venient, conduct him to our
 Lodgings, which was accordingly
 done, in Company with Cap.
 Hendrick; returned in the
 Evening, together with the afore-
said Friend, whom we were
 all glad to see in this Country. Besides the above acceptable
 visit, we had also had the Com-
pany, a few Days time, of two
 Commissioners departed by
 the Board of Presbyterians
 in Boston, and sent here
 in order to inspect into the
 Truth of some Charges exhibit-
ed by the Oneida Chiefs
 against their Minister
 Kirkland ; These Men be-
sides attending to their own
 Business, enquired particu-
larly
 into the Nature and Design
 of ours, with which they seemed
 much pleased, and pased
 some Encomiums on the
 Benevolence of our Undertaking;
 and expressing their hearty
 Wishes for its Success: One of our Company also,
 felt his mind weightily im-
pressed with some serious
 Considerations relative to
 their Business, and took
 a seasonable opportunity to
 express it to them; reminding
 them how deeply the Re-
putation of that most ho-
ly Religion which we and
 they jointly profess, must be
 effected, in the Eyes of the
 Natives, by the professed
 Promulgations thereof, living
 answerable, or contrary
 to the purity of its Dictates,
 and also calling to their Re-
membrance, the many most
 glaring and painful Abuses,
 of this sacred function, which
 had from time to time, by
 Missionaries of different De-
nominations, been exhibited
 towards the Natives of America,
 to the great Scandal and
 wounding of the common
 Cause of Christianity: and
 modestly suggesting to them, our
 ap-
 apprehensions of the
 present Charges and Com-
plaints before them not
 being wholly groundless; We
 earnestly pressed upon them
 the necessity of great serious-
ness and impartiality in
 investigating and resulting
 upon this Business: They
 expressed their Satisfaction
 with this Interview; and
 parted with us very friendly;
 desiring to be favoured with
 a Line of Information in
 some future State of our
 Concern. Here it may be proper
 to introduce the following anec-
dote, of an Indian Bible, now
 in the Hands of John Serjent ,
 Minister to the Stockbridge
 Nation; and which we had the
 Sight of; it appears to have
 been entire, containing all
 the Books of the Old and
 new Testaments, translated
 into one of the Indian Lan-
guages; and they have a Tra-
dition amongst them; that
 the Translator was so Econo-
mical as to use but two Quills
 in the whole work. 4th. This morning about
 Eleven OClock, again attended
 a general Council of the
 Stockbridge’s, in order to in-
form them what we had
 agreed to do for them, and
 also to take our leave of them;
 Our Friend Joshua Evans ac-
companying us: Our Council
 was opened by a short State-
ment of our proceedings amongst
 them; and then reading the
 propositions agreed to on the
 29th. of last month; after which,
 we had a solid Opportunity
 with them; in which graci-
ous Goodness was experienc'd
 to be near, to the tendering of
 some minds, and furnishing
 with Ability to labour in
 much plainness and Love
 on Several Subjects, but es-
pecially on the use of strong
 Drink; pointing out the
 Way, and the only way, where-
by a Victory might be obtain-
ed over this, and all other
 Temptations of the grand
 Enemy of our Soul’s Happi-
ness; which consisted in Watch-
fulness and inward prayer,
 and faithful Obedience to the
 voice of the good Spirit in our
 Hearts, and a careful avoiding
 of
 of all Places and Occasions
 of Temptation. After which Samuel , an
 old Indian man, and a Mara-
vian, in an affecting Man-
ner spoke to us in substance
 as follows, viz. Brothers, I glad to see you
 in my Heart, and to hear
 your good words; you use us
 just like a father; I am
 old, have lost all my family,
 and can’t live many Days;
 but all this Spring I think
 Jesus will send me some
 Comfort in my trouble;
 but nobody say any thing
 to me ‘till now you are come:
 I wish I was young, then I
 would do what you say direct-
ly, and I will go and see how
 your Friends work at Oneida,
 every two or three Days, &
 tell our young Men how you
 do: He afterwards made
 a moving and weighty Speech
 to the Indians in his own
 Language; the weight of which
 was sensibly felt, even, by us
 who did not understand a
 word of what he said; and we
 afterwards understood was re-
markably so by them; they
 having never heard the like
 from him before. After a short but solemn
 Pause, Cap. Hendrick , in
 Behalf of the Nation, made,
 in substance, the following Reply. Brothers, We shall speak
 but a few words: We are glad
 of your Company amongst
 us these three weeks, that
 as you told us in the first
 Council, you might know
 what was best for all the
 Indians here, and now you
 tell us, what you think pro-
per to do for our Nation. Brothers, We rejoice that the good
 Spirit has put it into your
 Hearts, and into the Hearts of your
 Brothers at home to do us good,
 we believe it is from the good
 Spirit because your Words are weigh-
ty, and we feel them so on our
 Minds. Brothers, The Offers you make us
 are great, we did not expect so
 much from friends at this
 time; we are thankful to the
 great Spirit for putting it into
 your Hearts, and also for giving
 you the Ability to do it. Brothers, You give us Smiths
 Tools, for which we thank you,
 we have suffered much for want
 of them, having been obliged to
 go many miles, and sometimes
 loose
 some Days to get one
 Link of a Chain mended. Brothers, Your assisting us
 to build a Grist-mill, will be a
 great Thing for us; we have suf-
fered many years for want of
 one, as you are sensible of
 it; and especially our women,
 who are obliged to pound our
 Corn; they join us to thank
 you heartily. Brothers, Your Offer to help
 us in keeping up our School is
 very acceptable to us, be assured
 we will do our part towards
 it. Brothers, What you propose re-
specting the money lent us, is
 very agreeable to our minds &
 also the Encouragement you
 offer to our Industry by premi-
ums: we hope our young men
 will have Courage to follow
 those ways you point out to
 us. Brothers, We now freely pro
mise, that we the Chiefs, and
 all our orderly young men,
 will endeavour to follow your
 Advice, and with the Blessing
 of the good Spirit, we hope to
 live more than ever as white
 people do; foe we never received
 such
 such Encouragement before
 from any people. Brothers, We observe what you
 tell us, that we must be an
 Example to other Indians,
 who are far behind us, and we
 will try to be so, more and more. Brothers, We shall remember
 what you request for the young
 men you leave behind you;
 our minds are the same with
 yours, we will maintain our
 Friendship with them; and will
 be always ready to assist them if
 they get in trouble. Brothers, We spoke to you several
 Days ago about the Difficulties
 We are under in not receiving
 our annual Income from the
 United States: We desire your
 Friends would help us in this
 Case, and appoint one to take
 care to get our money sent to
 us regularly; and we also desire
 you to try to get Government to
 fulfil their Agreement with
 us about building a Mill. Brothers, This is all we got
 to Say. 5th. The forepart of this Day,
 we were employed in writing
 Letters home, and making some
 necessary Arangements;
 In the Afternoon two of our
 Number
 Number went to Oneida to
 give notice, and request a gene-
ral Council next Day: This Evening received an
 Account of the fourth Murder
 committed amongst these peo-
ple within these few months
 past; all of which are sup-
posed to have been occasioned
 by the Use of Spirituous Li-
quors; One was of the Tuscoro-
ra’s in the 11th. mo. last, One of
 the Stockbridge’s not long af-
ter, one of the Oneida’s in the
 6th. mo last; and the lastother of
 the Cayuga’s a few Days since;
 Three of these Cases in the
 very neighbourhood where
 we now are; and the other
 about 60 miles from this pla
 place, on our way to Conandar-
que. Some of the minds of these
 people are sensibly affected by
 the melancholy Havoc pro-
duced amongst them by this
 cruel Tyrant: (for so they often
 call it), as the following Me-
morial to the Assembly of
 New-York will evince. To the great Sachem and
 Chiefs of the State of New York,
 now sitting around the great
 Council Fire at New York. Brothers, Before you cover your
 Council, we beg your
 Attention to the voices of your
 brother, the different Tribes living
 Oneida Country; speaks to you in
 the remembrance of the friendship
 you have manifested towards them in
 all their Treaties. We ourselves have held Councils at
 different Times to contemplate the
 welfare of our nations because we
 cannot but groan to see our Situation:
 It is also melancholy to reflect on
 the ways of our forefathers. Brothers You are sometimes sorry
 to see the deplorable Situation of your
 Indian Brethren, for which
 you have given us many good
 Counsels; tho’ we feel ourselves
 willing to follow your Coun-
sels, but it has made no Effect
 as
 as yet. Our Situation is
 Still miserable: Our Ancesters
 were conquered immediately
 after you came over this Island
 by the Strong Hero, who does
 still reign among Indian
 Tribes with Tyranny; who
 has robbed us every Thing that
 was precious in our Eyes:
 But we not mention every
 Thing particular how this
 Tyrant has used us; for your
 Eyes have been open to behold
 our doleful Situation; By the
 power of our Enemy our Eyes
 have been blinded Our young
 Men seem become willing
 Slaves to this despotic Heroe
 so
 so that we displeased the
 great good Spirit, and could
 not become civilized people.
 In looking back we see no-
thing but Desolation of our
 mighty men: In looking
 forward we see the Desola-
tion of our Tribes. Our
 Chiefs have used their Endea-
vours to reform their respective
 people, but having seen
 no Success they seem dis-
couraged, and hang down
 their Heads. Brothers, In remembrance
 of your kind promises, we
 unite our Cries to you for
 help: perhaps some of
 you are ready to say; what
 man that must be that has
 abused so much of our Bre-
thren: never was such Tyrant
 Hero, or Tyrant heard of, that
 ever meddled with Indians;
 but in literally he is your
 only begotten Son, and his
 Name you call rum, and
 the names of his Officers
 are Brandy, Wine, and Gin. And we know you have
 power to control him, and
 as we desire to live in peace,
 and to become civilized Nati-
ons, we earnestly entreat
 you
 you to use your power and
 wisdom to prevent all peo-
ple, whether white or black,
 who may cause Rum and
 other Spirituous Liquors
 throughout your State, to come
 into the Hands of our Tribes;
 except when Sickness requir'd
 our Chiefs may keep little
 for that purpose: for your
 Compliance with this our
 Request, we will ever acknow-
ledge your friendship. Done at
 Oneida
 Village on
 the 15th. Day
 of March

 Chiefs and Warriors of
 Oneida Nation. John Schonandoah Christian Thoningivensera Wm. Thadughgwesera 
 Tuscorora Nicholas Schuysick David Tydeaseagurnel Peter Dyongevet 
 Stockbridge Hendrick Aupaumut Joseph Quinney Joseph Shanquithqueth 6th. This Day attended the
 Oneida Council, agreeably
 to our Conclusions of yesterday;
 which was opened by the revival
 of our Plan of a settlement,
 acording to the variations agreed
 to at our last; and having it
 clearly drawn out, it was sign-
ed by all our number and six
 of their Chiefs; we endeavoured
 to explain the reason of our
 present Offers falling short
 of the Suggestions contained
 in our general Letter of last
 Spring; which we understood
 they had observed, with Express-
ions of surprise; letting them
 know, that every thing must
 have a Beginning; and that
 it could not reasonably be
 expected, that we should go
 into all that was mentioned
 in that Letter at once: They
 appeared to be pretty well
 reconciled to our plan; and
 expressed their Readiness
 to adopt it; and recommend-
ed to their young Men, who
 were present to engage with
 willingness into the Business:
 This Council was however not
 quite so satisfactory as could
 have been desired, none of their
 women being present tho’ de-
sired by us, and some other Cir-
cumstances was not altogether
 agreeable*: In the Evening
 returned to our Lodgings at
 Captain Hendricks , where we
 made out a List, for the Divi
sion of our Articles between
 the Oneida, Stockbridge, and
 Tuscorora’s, retaining a suf-
ficient part for the use of
 our Friends who stay here. *The Interpreter being in Liquor 7th. This morning had
 a very solid and satisfactory
 parting with the principal
 men and women of the
 Stockbridge Nation, at the
 House of their Chief, Cap.
 Hendrick, many of their
 Hearts being tenderly affected
 at parting with us: we then
 set out for Oneida Town; and
 after arriving at our own
 rented House in that place,
 we felt our Minds disposed
 to sit down together to wait,
 for the renewal of our Strength
 in inward Retirement,
 Joshua Evans being also
 with us; and leaving the Door
 and windows open, the Indians
 came and looked at us in
 with silent Admiration, behav
 behaving in a good Degree Solid,
 and making no Disturbance. After this Sitting Joshua
 Evans expressed a Desire to
 have an Oppertunity with
 the Indians, many of whom,
 both of men & women, were now collected together,
 under an Expectation of the
 Goods being divided, and some
 of us also haveing a like Desire,
 not being fully relieved by
 the Opportunity of yesterday;
 it was at length proposed
 to the Indians, and agreed
 to, the Interpreter Jacob Reed 
 being present, and in a better
 agreeable Situation for such Bu-
siness, than at last Council:- This proved a much more
 Satisfactory Oppertunity than
 that of yesterday; our Hearts being
 enlarged with unfeigned Love
 towards them, much Counsel
 was communicated pertinent
 to their Situations; which was
 sensibly felt by some of them,
 especially of the Women, who
 are in general much more
 Solid and reachable than
 the men. After which they
 made us a short Speech, ex-
pressive of their Satisfaction
 with this opportunity; and
 our Business in general; among
 them; Observing that all the
 Time we had been amongst
 them we had spoken the same
 Language, and made no Change
 in our Words or Conduct. After which a venerable
 old woman, on behalf of her-
self and Sisters, observed in
 substance, That it was not
 common for their women
 to speak in Council; but
 that they were very glad
 to hear our good Words, and
 heartily thanked us. After this Opportunity we
 agreed upon the following
 Minute; a Copy of which was
 left with our Friends who
 stay here; viz. At a Conference of the
 Indian Committee held 7th.
 mo. 7th. 1796, at our rented House
 at Oneida Town, it was agreed
 to appoint Jacob Taylor Trea-
surer, for this Concern at this
 place, who is desired to keep
 regular Entries of all the mo-
ney received, and paid away,
 and to whom and for what.
 And there is now left in
 his Hands, after settling all
 Expences up to this Day, One
 Hundred Dollars. About four in the afternoon
 took an affectionate leave of
 our Friends Jacob Taylor , Hen-
ry Simmons, and Enoch
 Walker; and set out towards
 Onondago, lodging at an
 Indian House Eleven Miles
 on our way. Before we leave this Coun-
try it may be proper to note,
 two singular Advantages,
 peculiar to these parts
 above many others; and
 which the Indians, in Com-
mon with the white people,
 may and do enjoy: viz. The
 Sugar Maple & Salt Springs. From the Maple, they are
 able, with a small Expence,
 to furnish themselves with
 a plentiful supply of Sugar,
 Molasses, and Vinegar: And
 from the Salt Spring they
 are furnished plentifully
 with that valuable Article,
 equal in Quality, and perhaps
 lower in price, than in any
 Seaport Town in the United
 States. 8th. Pursued our Jour-
ney, and in about a mile
 and an half crossed the In-
dian Line; and a few miles
 further came to a place
 called deep Spring: This place
 pertinently takes its Name from
 the following curious Appear-
ance: There is a nearly round
 Hole in the Earth, of about
 50 or 60 Feet Diameter at
 the Top, and tapering down
 nearly to a point at the Depth
 of about 50 feet: the Water
 Springs out of the side near
 midway from the Top, to the
 Bottom and trickling down
 in a small Stream, sinks into
 a Cavity at the Bottom. Thence through a fertile and
 well improved new Country;
 more than one half of the cleared Land
 within sight of the Road, being
 either in Grain, or Timothy and
 Clover; some of the latter es-
pecially exceeding any Grass
 that I have ever seen in
 the most fertile Marshes
 of Pennsylvania; dined
 at Asa Danfords , on Onanda-
go Creek; from where we lodged
18. about 18 miles. In the Afternoon attend-
ed a small Council of the
 Onandago’s, at their Settlement
 about two miles up the Creek.
 There are but a small Body
 of them here, some of their
 Tribe being removed to
 Buffalo Creek, in the Seneca
 Country; and many of those
 who live here, having nothing
 to eat, were gone a hunting
 and fishing with their Wives
 and families; The few who
 were now here were very un-
willing to hold a Council with-
out having their Tribe all to-
gether; which, it appeared, could
 not be effected without a great
 Detension to us; we therefore
 proposed, that if they would
 give us an Opportunity to ex-
press our Minds to them
 in Council, and give us such
 Information as they could
 respecting their Circumstan-
ces, that we would leave the
 Substance of what we had
 to say to them, relative to the
 Business in writing; that
 their Interpreter might read
 and explain it to them when
 they should get all together:
 This being agreed to the Coun-
cil was opened, Abraham Ephraim Web-
ster a white man, and friend
 to them, and who had lived ma-
ny years amongst them, being
 our Interpreter: We let them
 know the nature of our Bu-
siness, and endeavoured to press
 on the necessity of a
 Change in their manner of Liv-
ing; and the Advantage that
 would arise to them from their
 Improving in Industry and
 Sobriety: After which obtained
 the following Information, viz.
 That they consist of about 20
 families and 135 Individuals,
 have 12800 Acres of very good
 Land, secured to them by Law
 so than no Individual of them
 can either sell or lease to white
 people; they have 1250 Dollars
 a year coming in from the
 State of new York, besides their
 share of the Gratuity from
 general Government to the
 Six Nations: but they have
 neither plow, Ox, Cow, now Horse;
 and, we are informed, generally
 spend their Money in a few
 Days after they receive it, in
 Rum, and some Trifles of small
 Account to them; and even
 the Blankets which they re-
ceive from general Government,
 are often pawned for Liquor
 before they get them home; They appear to have form-
ed great Expectations from
 our Letter; and shewed evident
 Marks of their Dissatisfac-
tion at their present Disap-
pointment: we let them
 know, that our Design was more
 to try to prevail with them to help
 themselves, and to make the best
 use of what they had, as well as
 to help them a little in the
 Beginning; rather than to
 make them large presents, or
 to hire men to come there to do
 their work from them, whilst they
 themselves lived in Idleness, &
 spent their own Money foolishly,
 [which seems to be much their Idea
 of our Intention]. Upon proposing to them the
 propriety of their buying Oxen &
 Cows with their Annual Income,
 instead of laying it out for Rum,
 &c. they answered, that they had
 concluded to buy a pair of Oxen
 with
 with the money which they
 received in this month; but
 when they received our Letter,
 they thought it not necessary
 to lay out their own money for
 that purpose; intimating that
 they supposed we would find
 them Teams and such things: We were deeply affected with
 the unreasonableness of their
 Expectations; as well as their
 extreme Indolence; or rather
 haughty Contempt of any
 Thing that bore the name of
 Labour; together with their
 apparent utter Insensibility
 of any thing that was said
 to them, on the necessity of
 a Reformation in their Life &
 Manners. We parted from them under
 serious Discouragments returning to the afores’d A. Danfords to lodge and left
 the following in writing with
 their Interpreter, viz. Brothers, We are sent out by the
 people called Quakers, who
 wrote to the Six Nations in the
 Winter to enquire whether they
 were desirous to learn how the
 white people manage their
 Lands; and to have your Children
 taught to read and write, and
 be instructed in useful Trades:
 They have directed us to visit
 you in your Towns, and acquaint
 ourselves with your Circumstan-
ces, and so inform them that
 they may judge what to do
 for you: we have settled Three
 of our Friends at Oneida; and
 some Time hence, we could
 with some of you to go and
 see them: and perhaps also they
 may come and see you: But,
 Brothers, there are so few of
 you here, and there are so ma-
ny larger Bodies of Indians,
 that it is not likely we can
 share any of our people to set-
tle here soon: But we expect,
 however that next Spring we
 can send you some Hoes, Axes,
 Sythes, and other Tools to
 work with: and if you have
 a mind to send six or eight
 of your Boys, from Eight to
 Twelve years of Age to learn
 reading, writing, farming &
 Trades our Friends at Oneida
 will tell you how to send them,
 and we will take Care of them,
 as our own Children; and if they
 behave well ‘till they are twen-
ty one, we will give them some
thing to begin with: And
 then they may return &
 teach you what they have
 learned. Brothers, We find you have
 good Land, and we see you
 raise some Corn; we advise
 you
 you to plant twice as much
 next year; and besides you
 have 1250 Dollars a year, which
 give enough for each family
 to buy a Cow in one or two
 years; we advise every Hous-
keeper to buy one with the
 Money divided to him and
 his Children: you could
 keep your Cows easily; and
 they would give you Milk; &
 then you might make But-
ter and Cheese, for you to eat;
 and besides your Cows would
 make Beef when they
 got old. Brothers, Take our Advice, and
 we shall be encouraged to do
 more for you; for we wish to
 help you; if you will but be
 willing to help yourselves. Onondago 7th. mo. 8th. 1796 John Peirce Joseph Sansom Isaiah Rowland James Cooper 9th. Pursued our Journey
 towards Cayuga, rode 15 miles
 to Breakfast, at Moses Car-
penters: most of this Stage
 good Limestone Land; but
 thinly
 thinly settled; where there
 are farms they appear
 flourishing. Thence to Henry Moors 
 where we dined, 16 miles:
 Thence leaving the Genesee
 Road, and travailing mostly
 through the woods for about
 6 Miles to Frederick Gerard’s , within
 about 2 ½ miles of the
 Indian settlement, on the
 Cayuga Lake: Thence in
 Company with the 
34. him to the Indian Town;
 where we arrived in the
 Evening; but finding se-
veral of their Number
 were gone out a fishing and this
 being seventh Day, we con-
cluded to put off the Coun-
cil ‘till Second Day morn-
ing; and returned with the
 aforesaid Frederick Gerard 
 to lodge: This man, with
 his family, had lived several
 years amongst the Cayuga
 Indians; but his place
 is now, by a late purchase
 made of these people, with-
out their Boundaries. 10th. This being first Day,
 our Friend Joshua Evans had
 notice given of a Meeting
 to be held at the House of
 our Host for the Benefit
 of
 of the white Inhabitants;
 which we attended; as well
 as about 20 of the Neighbour-
ing white people; who be-
haved in a good Degree solid. In the Afternoon Accom-
panied our aforesaid Friend
 to the Cayuga Settlement
 of Indians, where he had
 also appointed to have a Meet-
ing with the Natives, to begin
 at three OClock: we waited
 ‘till after four, and not one
 them came to the place ap-
pointed, and even the In-
terpreter, John Jourdan ,
 at whose Cabbin we met,
 had himself gone away just
 before we got there, and returned
 no more whilst we staid: On
 our Return, some of our Com-
pany met him; and he ap-
peared totally insensible of
 any impropriety in his own,
 or people’s Conduct, relative
 to this Matter; alledging
 that some were gone one way,
 and some another, and could
 not well get together. 11th. This morning agreeably
 to the Appointment of seventh
 Day Evening, we again attended
 at Cayuga; and after wasting
 several Hours, a few of the prin
 principal
 principal Indians, of men
 and women, came together:
 They opened the Council by
 producing our Letter of last
 Spring, and informing that
 they had answered it by Let-
ter to Cap. Chapin : After
 which we opened the Nature
 of our Concern in general,
 having the Aforesaid John
 Jourdan, for our Interpreter,
 who was a very poor one, and
 then informed them how
 far we had proceeded in it;
 particularly towards their
 Brothers the Oneidas; and
 that our Regard was equally
 towards them all; but that
 we could not begin with all
 at once; and therefore our par-
ticular Business, at this Time,
 with them, and all the other
 Tribes westward of the Oneida’s,
 was, to enquire into their par-
ticular Circumstances, and
 take word to our Friends, in
 Order that they might con-
sider how they might be most
 useful to them against another
 Season; but withal informed
 them, that as their Number
 was so small, it was not likely
 that we could settle any of our
 Friends amongst them; but
 that we thought Friends would
 be
 be willing to take four or
 five of their Boys, between
 seven and twelve years old,
 and learn them to work at
 farming, and some Trades,
 and give them so much school-
ing, as to learn them to read
 and write English: And
 also that we thought they
 might expect some farm-
ing Utensils next spring. They expressed their Satis-
faction with our proposals,
 and a willingness to send some
 of their Children to us, but
 said they must consult some
 more of their women, their
 being but few of them present,
 we closed the Council, after having
 obtained the following Information,
 viz. That they consist of about
 13 Families, between 50 and
 60 Individuals, who live on this
 Reservation; They have near
 four Thousand Acres of Land; we
 think not of quite so good a
 Quality as where we have been
 before; they have 2300 Dollars
 a year coming in from the State
 of New-York, besides their
 Share of the Gratuity from
 General Government to the
 Six Nations; but that part
 of this Tribe which has re-
moved westward, and which
 is
 Is about one half; they say
 has a Right to their Share
 of this Money if they call
 for it. They have
 six Cows, neither oxen nor Horses,
 and raise very little of any
 Thing, living principally by
 Fishing and hunting; and par-
ticularly the former, the Lake
 abounding with a large kind
 of Eel which they catch in
 great plenty. These peo-
ple, as well as the Onandago’s
 appear totally averse to all La-
bour; and very insensible of
 any thing that could be said
 to them on the most interest-
ing Occasions. After this Council we proceeded
 on towards Conandarque; and
 after riding along side of the
 lake about 7 1/2 miles we
 crossed in a good sail Boat;
 and having a lively Breeze
 we had a short and pleasant
 passage, being about 20 mi-
nutes, in going a mile and
 a half; we dined at the ferry
9. House, James Bennet’s ; and
 while our Dinner was prepar-
ing one of our Company took
 up a News paper, printed
 a few Days since at Whites;
 Town within about 18 or 20 miles
 of Oneida Castle Town; in which
 was an Account of the various
 Tosts
 Tosts drunk at a Dinner
 in that Town on the 4th. of
 this month; amongst which
 was the following: The Enterprising and Bene-
volent Quaker Missionaries;
 may they succeed in civilizing
 our Neighbours the Oneidas. However trifling and un-
worthy a place in these Notes
 the above may appear to some;
 it however speaks a Language
 Consonant to what is herein
 before noted, of the favour-
able Disposition of the Fron-
tier Inhabitants in these
 parts, to our Business. After Dinner pursued
 our Journey, and arived at
 Geneva, a small Town on the
14.Seneca Lake, about 14 Miles;
 where we lodged. This Lake and the Cayuga
 are said to be nearly equal in
 Dimensions; being about 42
 miles in Length; and from
 one and an half, to four in
 Bredth: we rode several Miles
 up its Banks, and the Wind
 being high and setting towards
 us, the Rolling of a large
 and troubled water, the dash-
ing of the Billows, sometimes
 within a yard of our Horses feet,
 afforded as an agreeable Sensation
 both to the Eye and Ear. At this place we had the
 Com-
 Company of a female follower
 of the deluded Jemima Wilkin-
son, whose settlement is a few
 Miles up this Lake; her de-
portment was Grave and Sober;
 we observed a cautious Guard
 in her Conversation, & answers
 to our Interrogations, not to make
 use of, or any way, directly or
 indirectly acknowledge the
 name Jemima Wilkinson ,
 but always termed her the
 friend: We understand this
 woman is losing her Reputa-
tion here; divers of her principal
 followers having left her: and
 the following curious Inter
view between her and Cap.
 Brant, an Indian atfrom Grand
 River, was related to me as a
 fact, by Cap. Hendrick at
 Stockbridge; viz. That the said
 Brant being in those parts
 Jemima sent him a message
 that she had a Desire to see him,
 upon which he paid her a
 visit; and upon her asking
 him a certain Question, he an-
swered her in his own Language
 and she not understanding him,
 repeated the Question, or asked
 another; he again answered
 in another Indian Language;
 and so the third time: When
 he observed to him that she
 had heard of him, that he was
 a Scholar and a man of Informa
tion, and that she had promised
 herself some satisfaction from
 his Company and Conversation;
 and that she had now asked him
 a civil Question; and that he
 had answered her three Several
 Times in a Language that she
 did not understand; and as she
 knew he could speak English, she
 could not account for such treat-
ment: To which Brant re-
plied, with an Interrogation if
 she did not understand what
 he said to her; To which she
 again answered, No; I do not
 understand your Indian Lan-
guages: - To which Very well
 Madam, replied Brant , then
 you are not the person you
 pretend to be, for Jesus Christ
 understands Indian as well
 as English. 12th. This morning rode
 to Conandarque, about 14 miles.
 The roads extremely deep and
 swampy: In the Afternoon
 had a Conference with Israel
 Chapin Superintendant for
 Indian Affairs, from which we
 learn that Captain Abeel, Alias,
 Cornplanter, one of the Seneca
 Chiefs, had sent him an an-
swer to our Letter of last spring,
 that he was willing to receive
 Friends, and that he would be glad
 to have them come and settle
 about him; because he believed
 they
 they were good people; but
 Farmer’s Brother, on behalf of the
 settlement at Buffalo Creek,
 which is called the main Seneca
 Settlement, answered that he
 thought it best to wait, and see
 our progress with their eastern
 Brethren, before they received us. After this Conference, hearing
 of some people who were called
 by our name a few miles back
 of this place, we concluded to
 go and see them; and if conve-
nient, rest ourselves a Day or
 two &c. Accordingly we set out,
 having a young man, son to
 one of these people for our
 Guide; we seperated on the
 way
 Way, some of us going to Jacob
 Smiths, and others to Nathan
 Cumstalks and Abraham Lap-
pums: amongst these people
 we were kindly entertained; they
 being friends by Education and
 profession, tho' not one of the men
 are actually in membership. 13th. Staid with our aforesaid
 Friends, rested ourselves, got
 our Linen washed, and wrote
 some Letters home. 14th. Returned to Conandar-
que, had a further Conference
 with Cap. Chapin ; by which
 we learn, that the Seneca's
 have various settlements west
 of the Genesee River, and con-
sist
 sist of the following number
 of Individuals; viz. Main Village at Buffolo Creek 381 White Chiefs Village 107 Catauraugurus 225 Allegany {Cornplanter’s 
 2 Villages} 331 Tawniwandic 104 * Canawaugus 22 * Ghenesee Village 91 * Bigtree Village 80 * Squakee Hill 190 * Ka-oun-o-de-o 113 1644 * Note such as have this mark
 are said to unite with Corn-
planter’s Answer. The Seneca’s have five
 Hundred Dollars a year from
 Oliver Phelps ; besides their Share
 of the 4500 Dollars from the gene-
ral Government, to the Six Nations. This Evening we wrote the follow-
ing Letter to our Friends at Oneida,
 viz. Conandarque 7th. mo. 14th. 1796 Dear Friends, Your Situation and
 the important Concerns devolved
 upon you, have often been the
 Subjects of Serious Thoughtful-
ness to us since we left you, and
 we are free to propose to you;
 That as you may possibly find
 some Difficulty in getting as many
 of the young Indians to undertake,
 and stick to the Business, on the
 particular portion of Land alotted
 us, as was expected; we wish you
 not
 not to suffer Discouragements
 too much to take place in your
 Minds on that Account; but
 endeavour to get them to divide
 off particular portions of Land
 to particular persons, in some
 convenient places, and bestow
 the more of your Time in in-
structing and helping such;
 and where any who have un-
dertaken with you, on your
 Farm, shall be discouraged from
 the Length of Time, which, agree-
able to our plan, they must
 wait for their wages, we are
 willing you should advance some
 necessary Goods &c. to such, (which
 we desire you to purchase for
 that purpose) or actually hire
 others in Case of necessity; keeping
 a regular account thereof, and
 letting them know, that the value
 of all such Advance and hire is
 to be deducted out of the product
 of the place. With Love we remain your Friends. John Peirce Joseph Sansom James Cooper Isaiah Rowland 15th. This morning had a
 Conference amongst ourselves
 respecting the further prosecution
 of the Business before us; but not
 being able to come to a clear and
 Satisfactory Judgment relative
 to any further Movements; and
 it
 it being now near the End of
 the week, we concluded to spend
 a day or two more amongst our
 Friends and to meet at William
 EIngles on First Day; where our
 Friend Joshua Evans had appoint-
ed a meeting. 17th. and 18th. Being first and
 second Day, We had several seri-
ous Conferences on the Nature of
 our present Concern, and the
 propriety of our going forward
 into the Seneca Country at this
 Time; and two of our number,
 now approaching they felt
 a releasment in their minds
 from any further prosecution
 of the Business at the present;
 whilst the other two approached
 the Business not completed
 for which we were sent out, and
 that this was the right time to
 perform a visit to the Seneca's
 in some of their different Set-
tlements; our Situation became
 trying, and a spirit of Sympa-
thy and tender feeling for each
 other was sensibly experienced,
 to the tendering of our Hearts;
 and after various Sittings to-
gether, and feeling after our
 present Situation, and trying
 our several Concerns and pros-
pects, and a Spirit of brotherly
 Condiscension prevailing, it was
 at length resulted, as most safe
 to
 to keep together, and return
 homewards. After this Conclusion we
 had another Conference with
 Cap. Chapin ; informed him
 what we had done at Oneida,
 and other places where we had
 been; read to him most of our
 material Entries on Business;
 and informed him of our present
 prospect of returning home-
wards; and, with his advice,
 wrote the following Letter to
 Cap. Abeel, alias Cornplan-
ter. viz. Conandarque 7th. mo 18th. 1796 To Captain Abeel , and the differ-
ent Seneca Villages, who answer
 with him to our Letter of
 last Spring. Brothers, You received a Letter
 from your Brothers, the peo-
ple called Quakers, written
 last winter, and directed to
 the Six Nations of Indians; we
 have now received your Answer
 by Cap. Chapin , informing that
 you are willing to receive our
 proposals. Brothers, We who now write
 to you are a part of your friends
 who wrote to you last winter,
 and have been sent out by our
 Friends to do something for your
 Brothers the Oneida’s, whose answer
 answer
 answer to our Letter we
 had received before we left
 home; we have accordingly
 settled three of our Friends
 there, and furnished them
 with farming Utensils,
 in order to instruct, and en-
courage your Brothers, the
 Oneida’s in farming the
 Land like the white people;
 that so they may raise a
 great deal of Grain and
 Grass &c. off of a little Land. Brothers, Our Regard is e-
qually towards you all our
 Indian Brothers of the Six
 Nations; but you know that
 we cannot begin with all
 at once, nor do every thing at a
 Time; therefore our friends at
 home desired us to call and see
 some of our other Brothers of
 the Six Nations, in order to en-
quire into their Circumstances,
 and bring them word again, so
 that they might consider who
 to help next, and how to do it
 best; accordingly we have been to
 see your Brothers the Onandago’s
 and Cayuga’s, and gave them
 some advice, and enquired into
 their Circumstances, and shall
 carry a true Account home to our
 Friends: Now Brothers, we
 had thought of coming to see you
 also, for the same purpose; but
 it is now got late in the season
 before we could get here, and
 before we got your answer; and
 as the Road is very long through
 the wilderness, and the Hot
 Weather coming on, we think
 we can’t call to see you now;
 but we have enquired very
 particularly into your Circum-
stances, of your old Friend Cap.
 Chapin, and shall carry a true
 account to our friends at home;
 and we desire you to enquire of
 your Brothers the Oneida’s how
 our Friends behave amongst
 them, and how they like
 our plan and Conduct; that
 so you may be fully satisfied
 against we are ready to help
 you in the same way. Brothers, We must desire you
 to have patience with us, if we
 don’t do every Thing you ex-
pect, all at once: for if we settle
 any Body amongst you, we know
 they must be good Men, or else
 they may do you more hurt than
 good; and we must wait ‘till such
 offer of their own free Will, to come
 and live amongst you, out of Love
 to you, and by the Moving of the
 good Spirit in their own Heart
 for good Men, such as would do
 you good are not to be bought with
 Money, nor hired to come amongst
 you, without they feel this good
 Spirit enfluencing them there. Brothers, In Love, we bid you farewell. John Peirce James Cooper Isaiah Rowland 19th. This Morning left
 Conandarque, in order to go
 directly homewards; break-
fasted at William Ingles 
 3 Miles on our Way; thence
 up the side of the Conandar-
que Lake about 20 miles,
 dined to Nathan Watkins , at the head
 of it, where we dined: - This
 Lake is nearly equal in Width to
 the Seneca or Cayuga; but not
 much more than half the Length:
 After Dinner continued our Jour-
ney and lodged at one Huckers -; about 12 miles:
Here we lay on the floor, and
 our Horses fared badly, having
 neither pasture, hay, nor grain;
 A little Grass cut with a
 Sickle on the Edges of a
 Wheat Lot, was all that could
 be procured for them. 20th. This morning started early;
 there being nothing here to in-
duce any unnecessary Stay, break-
fasted in the woods, on Bread and
 Cheese, which we had with us, about
 8 miles on our way; Our Horses
 having no better repast after a
 trying night, than what they
 could collect for themselves about/along
 the Range where we stopped, & which
 was very poor: thence to a small
 Town, called Bath, in a very poor
 Country, where we dined; and
 got some indifferent Hay for our
 Horses, but no Grain, about 20
 Miles: Thence to one Pattison 
 at Post Town, near the painted
post, about 19 miles; here we
 lodged: our horses faring better
 having plenty of pretty good Hay
 but no Grain. About a mile from Bath stopped
 at the House of William Kersey 
 late of little York; On the Bank
 of a water called little Lake:
 This Lake is of a circular form,
 about half a mile Diameter, has
 no visible Inlet, nor outlet; the
 water nevertheless being clear and fresh,
 and wearing no appearance of
 Stagnation; and we are informed
 no bottom has ever been discovered
 in some parts of it, though sound-
ed with a Line of 40 Fathoms. 21st. Pursued our Journey,
 crossing the Cohocton, Conos-
teer, and Shomonga Creeks,
 which are waters of the Susque-
hannah, breakfasted at the
 Widow Lindsley’s about 14 miles;
 here we got pasture, and also
 Grain for our Horses; and got
 a small supply of Grain to
 carry with us; against tomorrow
 Ride; when we are informed we
 shall get no kind of Entertain-
ment, either for ourselves or
 Horses, for upwards of 40 Miles.
 Thence to William Carter’s about
 15 miles, where we lodged out
29.of necessity; there being no other
 House, of any kind, on this side
 of the mountains: This last Stage crossing
 the New-York and Pennsylvania Line. 22nd. This morning started be-
fore two OClock, proposing, in pos-
sible to reach some Quarters on the
 other Side of the Savage Mountains;
 breakfasted on Bread & Cheese, which
 we had previously provided; and fed
 our Horses, some on the Ground, and
 others in Holes cut cut for that
 purpose in the Logs; about 15
 Miles on our way. Thence proceed-
ing up the Mountain; our Roads
 increased not only in Roughness,
 but in most intolerable Bogs &
 Mire, for about 10 Miles, to
 a place called the Block House:
 where we dined, and fed out Horses,
 much in the same Manner
 as we breakfasted; only that we
 had better Troughs to feed in: Here is a tolerable House, and
 might be of great use to Travail-
ors, was there but a suitable per-
son living in it: but its present
 Occupant is not only so unpro-
vided with Accommodation that
 it is seldom anything can
 be had either for man or Beast
 excepting a little Liquor; but
 is
 also of so desperate a Charac-
ter, that most Travailers are
 afraid to trust themselves under
 his Roof all Night. Then 
still over the Mountains for
 about 12 Miles further; where
 we again fed our Horses at the foot of this Mountain in
 like manner aforesaid; then
 to James Thomson’s on Lycoming
46.Creek about 9 Miles; where we
 arrived before sun set: and tho
 both ourselves and Horses were
 much fatigued, the satisfaction
 we felt from the Reflection
 of being over the most dif-
ficult part of our Journey
 and near a Settlement of
 Friends
 was reviving, and tended to
 sweeten our present Situ-
ation. 23rd. This morning found the
 Effect of yesterday’s Ride, one
 of our Horses being badly bruised,
 and entirely unfit to ride, we
 were under the Necessity of
 leading, or at least letting it
 follow, and one of us walking
20. by turns for about 20 miles
 to William Ellis’ in Munsey.
 This being Seventh Day, we
 concluded to rest ourselves
 and Horses here until
 Second Day. 24th. Being first Day at
tended Munsey Meeting. 25th. After Dinner left our
 agreeable Quarters at munsey
 and pursued our Journey
 homewards, lodged at Jesse
 Haynes’ at fishing Creek;
21. about 21 miles. 26th. Proceeded on, crossed Sus
quehannah, at Cattawissy,
 on Horseback, dined at John
 Lloyds, at said place; about
 15 miles: Thence to Frederick
 Levenburg’s on the east side
28. of the Little Mountain about
 13 miles; where we lodged. 27th. This Morning rode
 about 15 miles to breakfast,
 to an Inn kept by one George
 Reevers; thence to Richard
 Stevens’ about 18 miles;
 Thence to Francis Parvins 
 at Maiden Creek, to lodge,
 46. about 18 miles. 28th. Left Francis Parvins 
 after Dinner, rode to Ben-
jamin Scarlet’s at Robinson,
16. about 16 miles; where we
 lodged. 29th. This Day, at Several
 Stages, reached my Habitation
40. at Darby, about 40 Miles,
 & found my family all well. Subduplicate ratio, The ratio of
