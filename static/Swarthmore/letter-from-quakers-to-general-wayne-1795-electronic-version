 Philadelphia 25th 5th Mo 1795 Respected Friend It has been considered as 
 a Duty by our Religious Society from the first 
 Settlement of Pennsylvania to labour and use 
 Endeavours to promote peace with the Indians 
 solely with a View to prevent the Calamities 
 of War, and being informed that a Treaty is 
 like to take Place with that people under thy Superintendance and 
 Direction, the Subject engaged the Attention 
 of our Meeting for Suffering, with other 
 Friends from the different Quarters of our 
 Yearly Meeting, who on Deliberation 
 felt a Desire to unite any Influence they 
 may have with on the Indians with the general 
 Government to promote so good a Work -- An Address to the Indians was prepared 
 in the Year 1793 which was forwarded by 
 some of our Brethren to the care of Alexr 
 McKee, a copy of which with something 
 additional has with the Consent of the 
 President & of Col Pickering been concluded 
 upon to be sent to thy care with a small 
 Present of Goods as pr Invoice. We request 
 the favour of thee to present deliver those Addresses 
 in the usual way with our particular present 
 of Goods in the usual Way in the Name of our Religious Society. With sincere Desires 
 for thy Welfare and that thou may be favoured 
 with that wisdom which is profitable to direct 
 in conducting the Business in such way as may 
 tend to the Glory of God, thy own substantial Peace 
 and the Benefit of all concerned We remain with due Respect 
 My real Friends
 To General Anthy Wayne Esq.
