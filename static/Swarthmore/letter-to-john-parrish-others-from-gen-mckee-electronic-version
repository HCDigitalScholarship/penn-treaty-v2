 Foot of the Miami Rapids June 26.th 1793 Gentlemen It affords me very sincere pleasure to be
informed, by your Letter of the 19th. of the humane
and disinterested views which have influenced you
to undertake so long a Journey from the hopes of giving
assistance in the establishment of a just & equitable
Peace between the United States and the Native Amerns. Be assured Gentlemen that the accomplishment
of that object, is nearest my heart & that I have long
most sincerely wished to see a--- to the effusion of
human blood. I can not tell when the treaty will
commence at Sandusky, the Indians being at 
present much Alarmed with a report of an Army
having advanced into their Country; as soon
however as it shall be in my Power ye may
expect, with all others concerned, to be informed
of the time it may probably commence 
I am Gentlemen
With great truth & Sincerity
Your Friend and Humble
ServantA Mc.Kee Mesrs. Jn. Parrish Jacob Lindley Wm. Saverey Joseph Moore John Elliott Wm. Hartshorn
