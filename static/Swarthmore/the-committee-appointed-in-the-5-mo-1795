ble time elapsed before we were regularly inform'd by the 
General of his Compliance with our request, the reason 
for which delay is asignd in his Letter to us dated at 
Detroit the 5th Septr last, wherein he informs us of 
the particular care exercised by him in conveying to the 
understandings of the Indians the substance of the 
aforesaid Epistle & our motives in sending them a small 
present, & of the satisfaction manifested by them on the 
occasion. This seasonable Testimony of our regard ap
pearing to have a good effect, there being as the General 
expresses it, the fairest prospect of a lasting peace and 
friendly intercourse, between the Citizens of the United 
States & those Aborigenes of America. Philada 12 mo. 15th 1796
