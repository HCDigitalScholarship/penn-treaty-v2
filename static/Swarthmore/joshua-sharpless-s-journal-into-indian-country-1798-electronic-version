 Feeling an engagement of Mind to 
 Join John Pierce in a Visit to the Indian 
 natives of this Land, after some close exer-
 -cise of Mind on the Occasion, I gave up:
 and on the 30th day of the 4th Mo 1798, after 
 a comfortable Opportunity in my fami-
 -ly, several friends being present, I took
 an Affectionate farewell of them, and a-
 -bout one O clock in the afternoon set
 of in Company with John Pierce , and
 Henry Simmons , in order to pursue a
 Journey to the Northwest parts of this,
 and New York State, to assist in form-
 -ing a Settlement among the Indians, for
 their improvement in Agriculture, and
 more of a Civilized Live, we stopped and
 took some refreshment at John Truman ’s,
 and Lodged at Isaac Taylor s. 22 miles 5mo 1 A fine day for traveling, tho
 warm, went to Abraham Gibbons ’s
 11 miles, here by appointment we met
 with Joel Swayne , and Halladay Jack-
 -son, two young Men who with Henry
 Simmons had given up to reside some
 time among the Indians for their
 religious and temporal benefit, took
 dinner here, then went 7 miles to Lan-
 -caster, where stopping and doing some
 business, we went on 12 miles to Wrights
 ferry on Susquehanna, where there is
 a pretty Town lately laid out, it con-
 -tains 20 or more good buildings, beauti-
 -fully situated on an elevation above
 the River, the shore of which was lined
 with many thousand feet of White
 Pine boards and other Lumber which had been down that River for
 near half a Mile. most of this days
 ride has been was through a fruitful well
 improved Country, with good Stone 
 Houses and Barns, a large proportion
 of the land was sown with Rye; some of
 the Wheat fields looked pretty well, but
 in general Poor; Clover not so forward
 as in my neighborhood; some beauti-
 -ful Meadows, between Lancaster and
 this place, 30 miles 2nd a rainy Morning, stayed under shelter until
 8 O Clock, and then Crossed the River in the Rain 
 it is one Mile and 12 perches wide, which
 a Man and horse crosses for 6d; a cheap ferry,
 thence to York Town 12 miles mostly through
 a Valley, perhaps 10 or more miles wide, some
 beautiful Meadows made their appear-
 -ance, more particularly within a few miles
 of the River, and this Town, the Winter
 Grain mostly Poor, though the Land appeared
 to be of a good quality, and well farmed,
 The town of York has an agreeable ap-
- pearance, in which there are a number
 good Buildings; it is beautified by a large
 stream of Water called Codoras which runs
 through the Town, we dined here at a Public 
 House,— then set of for Isaac Everet s.
 in 2 or 3 miles after we left the Town
 we got out of the Limestone Valley, and
 passed through a Country diversified
 with gentle Assents, and descents, pretty
 clear of stones, the Land in places
 thin, though well watered by the Branches
 of the Canowagoe, the main stream of
 which was nearly as large as Brandy-
 -wine, the Winter grain much affected
 with the fly, this has been a pleasant af-
 -ternoon to ride, the Wind at Northwest
 and pretty Cool, Stopped at John Garison ’s
 17 miles where we fed our horses and got
 some refreshment, then some of us went
 to Isaac Everett ’s 3 miles, where we lodged,
 leaving the others at John Garrisons . 32 miles. 3rd Set of early this Morning, and in about
 three Miles came to a large hill several miles over called the first, mountain which was
 4 or more Miles across, we then entred
 a body of Limestone Land, having Crossed
 the Yellow Breeches a large stream called Yellow Breeches, the 
 face of the Country pretty level, and much
 of it under Culture, Rye the prevailing Win-
 -ter Crop, which was mostly thin, Clover scarce-
 -ly made its appearance in any of the fields,
 which for want of better farming were
 very bare of pasture. fed at the Black horse
 14 miles, thence to Shippensburgh 12 miles,
 part of which was through a flat Pine bottom
 containing a large number of Ponds of stag-
 -nated Water, but as we advanced nearer
 the Town, we passed through high Cham-
 -pion Land, beautifully Timbered, then Cross-
 -ed a large, Stream which that sprang up a
 few Perches to our left, we were informed
 it mostly which often went dry in the fall, the town
 was more than half a Mile long, containing,
 as we were informed 250 houses, a number
 of which was were good Stone buildings, for 2 or
 3 miles after we left the town we passed through
 a beautiful well improved Limestone Coun-
 -try, thence through land not so desirable
 to Strawsburgh, a Village containing per-
 -haps 40 houses, built of Squared Logs, the which
 Town stands in a low place, hardly discover 
 able till we arrived nearly on it, Shortly
 after we passed through this Town, we began
 to Ascend the Blue Mountain, an high
 Towering eminence, steep and very Rocky,
 in about three Miles we arrived at the
 bottom of the Opposite side, where we
 Crossed the main branch of Conedogwine
 and took up our Quarters at George Skinner s,
 good accommodations, he has made valuable
 improvements, though in a Wild romantic Coun-
 -try. 29 miles 4th Set of early, we immediately asscened
 another Mountain much like our last,
 when we arrived at its Summit we had
 a delightful View of a well improved
 Valley three two or more miles in weadth, with
 a lofty Mountain beyond, Just as we ente-
 -red this Valley, we Crossed the Conacocheague
 Creek a beautiful stream, in about half
 a Mile we passed through Phanetts-Burgh 
 a Village of perhaps 30 Loghouses, shortly af-
 -ter we crossed passed this Town we ascend-
 -ed a third Mountain much like the two
 last discribed, from thence to Birds at fort
 Littleton 5 miles, through a rough Country, 
 Surrounded with lofty Mountains, some
 pretty good improvements in places made
 there appearance, and the Roads consider
 -ing the Roughness of the Country not to be
 complained of, here we got our Breakfast
 12 miles. from thence to Skinners on the
 top of Sidling hill 11 miles, through a rough,
 Broken, poor Country, very little inhabited.
 Sidling hill a lofty Mountain; 7 miles carried
 us over, we made near four miles on its
 Summit, which was very high, but our
 prospect not extensive by reason of some
 mountains which was nearby on each
 hand, as we began to descend a noble
 view presented, as far as the Eye could
 reach, having the Allegeny Mountain in
 full view at 20 or more miles distant, the
 extensive prospect between, looked like
 a delightful plain, Chequered with a few
 plantations, but when we came to tra-
 -verse it, we found many lofty hills, or
 Mountains, particularly about the Juni-
 -atta River, one Branch of which we
 Crossed, which was some 50 or so yards wide
 and more than Belly deep; directly upon 
 Crossing this stream we ascended the
 Steepest hill we have met with since we
 left home, it is admirable that so many
 Wagons which pass this road, should be able to get
 up it, I suppose we have passed by 20 this
 this day, mostly with families going to new
 Countries, a number of which were Crowded
 with Children; 17 people of different descrip-
 -tions belonged to one wagon. — when I view-
 -ed the hills and mountains about this River,
 I was struck with admiration that it ever found
 a way through them to the Susquehanna, but
 I will assure my readers that its meanders
 are very various, and serpentine, some 5 or 6 miles after we
 Crossed it this stream we had the River nearby on each
 hand perhaps not more than half a mile a-
 -part. we took up our Quarters at one
 Hartley ’s near the its banks, of said river, he has a valuable
 plantation, and pretily situated. most
 of this days ride has been through a
 very broken, poor, and thinly settled Coun-
 -try. — 38 miles 5th Went 6 miles up the Juniatta, through
 a rough, Mountainous Country to Bedford,
 having about one mile back crossed the 
 River on a Bridge, the Town stands in
 a Valley Surrounded by high Mountains, it is
 a pretty pleasant situation, being seated on an
 elevated Spot near a branch of the River, the Town it
 contains a number of good Stone buildings
 among which are a Courthouse, Jail, &c: here
 we got our breakfast, and then passed over
 a very Mountainous, poor Country, and but
 thinly settled to the Allegenies, which Moun-
 -tain tho high, was not difficult ascending,
 being rather a succession of Mountains than
 one huge pile, we had several very steep As-
 -scents and descents, while on this Mountain,
 yet our road went much of the way on the top
 of very high ridges, when we arrived at its
 greatest eminence, we stoped at an Inn and
 refreshed ourselves, here we met with a fine
 Spring of Water near the door. we here turned to the left taking the glade road, the descent from
 this Mountain was gradual, the Land arable
 tho stony, it is called 10 miles across, —We now
 entered what is called the Glades, we having understood
 in places there were flats or openings where
 much Grass was Cut, Yet where we went throug[h]
 was heavy Timbered, some of which was were sugar
 Maple being the first we had seen, the Land
 appeared good, was pretty thick settled, and 
 productive, we arrived at a Dutch
 Town called Berlin, containing upwards
 of 50 Houses, Mostly of Logs, and Frame, when
 at the sign of the Black House we got good
 entertainment. 36 miles 6 We started early this Morning with some hopes
 of reaching a friend’s House this evening, which
 was very desirably, for 2 or more miles the
 Land was good, and considerably Settled, tho
 Hilly. thence we entered a Chesnutt Country,
 the Soil thin, and in a while we came among
 abundance of Laurel, the road very Stony,
 Rocky, & Muddy, thence entered a Pine forrest
 being the first White Pines of note since we
 have met with; here they grew in abun-
 -dance, tho not very large, but few settlement
 the greatest part of this stage, stoped and got
 our Breakfast at John Thusier s 13 miles.
 from thence to Geo: Batchaler ’s 14 miles, the
 whole of this stage remarkable rough, the first
 3 or 4 miles the Land appeared pretty good tho
 very hilly, one hill more steep and long than
 any we have hitherto met with, was as we went
 down to Laurell—hill—Creek, a smart stream
 from thence to near this place called Laurell
 Hill, the whole of this stage very heavy Timbered
 so that the Hill comparatively speaking groan 
 ed under their great Load, abundance of
 which was beautiful Chesnut, the finest I reme
 remember to have seen, with a large Quan-
 -tity of Oak of various kinds, some Sugar
 Maple &c: much of this stage the road was very
 Rocky and Stony. From thence to Conalds—
 -Ville a small Town on the Yoxhiogeny 14 miles
 the most of this stage was poor, rough, and
 Mountainous, and but thinly settled, except
 within 3 or 4 miles of the River after we left
 the Chesnut Ridge. — We all took notice
 when on the Allegenies and for many Miles
 on this side, how very backward the Trees
 were, when we left home they were putting
 out fast, and the Weather being very warm
 they made rapid progress; yet this morning
 we remarked the buds of the Chesnut and
 White Oak were not formed into leaves so
 as to make an appearance, yet the same
 day as we descended from the Chesnut Ridge
 the Trees were all green, the sight was
 so Curious, and different from our late pros-
 -pect, that I measured some Chesnutt leaves
 and found them to be 3 Inches wide, and
 Six long, and sprouts of 8 or 9 Inches growth.
 So that I think there is at least, in three miles 
 Riding two Weeks difference in the Season.
 When on the Chesnut hill there is one of the most
 extensive prospects that is to be met with
 in traveling, both to the North, to the
 West, and to the South, I had no doubt but the View
 was of 50 miles extent, it was not so de-
 lightful as some I have seen, for want of a
 lofty mountain rising 10 or more miles in
 front, but it was Chequered with many Plan-
 -tations: in every direction, the View look
 -ed like an extensive plain, but when
 we came to the traverse it, we found many
 Steep Hills, but tho no Mountain; neither is
 there any to the Westward in the United
 States equal to those we have Crossed. We
 lodged with our kind friend Thomas Gibson 
 on the Bank of the River. 41 miles 7th a pleasant day, went to my Kinsman’s
 Reese Cadwalader s, near BrownsVille on
 the Monongahala, we Crossed the Yoxge
 Yoxhiogeny in a boat it was about 6 feet
 deep and perhaps 150 yards wide, in about
 half a mile after we crossed the River, we
 passed by a Merchant Mill erected on a
 very Curious Seat, the stream was small,
 but had a natural perpendicular fall over 
 a broad Rock which lay Horizontal of
 28 feet, the Mill was erected close to this
 Rock which formed a level Yard to the
 upper Road; under sd Rock was a Cavity
 or hollow place 12 feet high, and nearly
 as far back, which ran all across the
 Stream, over which the Water beautifully
 descended. From thence to the Mononga-
 -haly a continual succession of high hills
 and low Vales, the Very little bottom land
 fit for Meadow, the land is pretty clear of
 Stones, the soil in general good, and thick
 settled, yet some of the fields which had been
 a good while under Culture looked poor; I saw
 several fields of good Wheat, but more that
 looked were light. 8th: Went 12 miles this Morning to see my Cousin
 Benjamin Sharples , he lives on the West
 Branch of 10 mile Creek near Green Furnace.
 I crossed the Monongahala at BridgeTownport a
 Village containing near 50 houses, the place
 whereon the town stands was four years
 ago a fine Meadow. the River is a
 beautiful Stream, flows along with a
 very gentle Current, is 340 Yards wide
 and 10 or 12 feet deep, it has very high 
 Banks, yet last fall they were overflown
 the River as I was informed rose 42 feet
 Perpendicular. The people here were very
 busy building flat bottomed Boats, they are
 made out of green timber, about 12 feet wide,
 and from 20 to 30 feet long, boarded up, on
 each side, 5 or 6 feet high, and roofed over
 more than half way, I was informed many
 boats of this kind was built on this River
 and its neighboring Waters, they are
 sold at the rate of 11/3 per foot, for every
 foot they are in length, to people who come
 with families to these Waters, to take their
 departure Westward, and Sail Southwest,
 to new Countries, they put on board, horse
 Waggon, farming Utensels, Cowkind, hosehold
 furniture &c: and so great if the Spirit of emi-
 -gration down the Waters of the Ohio to dif-
 -firent places, that we were informed when
 at Pittsburgh by a very reputable Character
 that for 30 days past upon an average he
 thought there had been from 10 to 12 of these
 boats, containing from 20 to 50 persons so
 loaded, passing by that Town each day. they
 gently move down with the Current, and when
 they come to the mouth of the Scioto and other 
 rivers their Boats are of no further use, for
 their Construction is such they cannot be taken
 up the Stream, and are therefore often sold
 for a trifle, or turned adrift. — I went
 up the West side of the River and in about
 6 miles passed through a small Village called
 Fredricks Town, then up the River to 10
 mile Creek I passed over some very
 Rich bottoms on sd River and Creek;
 also hillsides very good, abounding with
 Black and White Walnut, Locust, Sugar
 Maple &c: as far as I have seen, if it was
 not for the Hills, it this would be a desirable
 Country, but they will ever be in the Way
 of farming, and conveying produce
 to Market, but its Vicinity with Water
 Cariage will very much facilitate the lat
 -ter, their best meadows are often to be found
 on the tops of high hills, which are often
 inclinable to be wet, and Springy, the
 land is inclinable to grass, yet Clover
 is not much propagated. the price of
 produce pretty good, Wheat 7/6 Rye 4/6
 Corn 3/9, Oates 3/9, Bacon 1/, Butter 1/61/3,
 Cheap 1/ 9 d home made sugar from 1/ to
 to one ¼ of which with Industry came the
 Country may always be supplyed 24 miles 9 Attended Redstone Meeting, dined at
 Reese Cadwaladers , where we have made
 our home since our arrival here, it is a good
 place for man and beast, Our horses have
 had very good Pasture, and been well
 fed with Grain, so that they recruited.
 Set of this afternoon for Pittsburgh, crossed
 the Monongalela at Bridgetownport, went
 down the west side of it said River to Alexander Bogg s
 on Pigeon Creek where we lodged 11 m
 having a few miles back crossed Trout Run 10th Set of early this Morning, Stopped at Par-
 -kers, fed our horses and got our Break-
 -fast, a number of curious falls pre-
 -sented on small streams in this last stage,
 at a Certain depth much of this Country
 appears to be covered with broad Rocks
 lying Horizontally, which about the
 streams is washed bare, over the edges
 of these Rocks the Water often falls, from
 2 to 12, or 15 feet, in many places the Rock
 is hollow, so that there are large Cavities
 under where the water falls, quite dry.
 from hence to Pittsburgh 16 miles, from 
 Bridgeport to that said place, the face of the Coun
 -try has no remarkable variation, it is
 all the way a continual succession of hills
 tho not so high and steep as about Bridge-
 -port, the Land gradually decreased in
 its fertility, is all the way settled tho thinly, some
 fields of Wheat and rye looked very well, yet 
many others were poor, was generally heavy
 Loaded with timber; the greatest body of
 which was White Oak, Some Sugar Maple
 along the low ground, yet the further to-
 -wards Pittsburgh the scarcer, I have seen next
 to no pine since I came over the Moun-
 -tains; some Chesnut in places; but rails
 are mostly made of White Oak; as are
 there houses, — We had every little prospect
 of Pittsburgh, until we arrived near by,
 the Town stands in a beautiful plain
 surrounded by very high hills, just
 about the Junktion of the Allegeny and
 Monongahely Rivers, Which Rivers when
 united make the Ohio, we descended a very
 steep hill or Mountain to the Mononga-
 -hela, not fit for any Wagon to go up, or down,
 though they often pass it, the river flows gently along 
 at the foot of this Mountain, where we Crossed
 it, being half a mile wide and 10 or 12 feet
 deep, this River is most in View from the
 Town, and the greatest place of trading,
 the Street next to sd River is beautifully
 Situated, being level; 50 or 60 feet wide,
 and elevated perhaps 50 feet above
 the Water, there are places for Waggons
 to go down, and a fine gravelly mar-
 -gin to drive on, the town when we
 were there was a place of great Concourse
 abundance of People take their depar-
 -ture from here to various parts of the
 Western, and Southwestern Territories,
 And up the big Bever, the Allegeny
 River, Friench French Creek to Casa-
 -waga, Presqueisle &c. — It was the time of
 the supreme Court when we arrived here,
 and we had some fears whether we should
 get accommodations for ourselves and horses,
 but having before we Crossed the River
 enquired for the best Tavern; we were
 recommended to the Greentree near the
 River, where upon our arrival after some 
 hesitation we were taken in, where we
 found good accommodations. Some discou-
 -ragements attended my mind on my way
 thither, concerning the business we were
 going on, it being in its self important,
 to be transacted among a people of
 a Strange language, in an unknown
 and Wilderness Country, and a great un-
 -certainty how we should be able to get
 the goods we have in care to our desir-
 -ed port; but upon our arrival here,
 and being introduced to some for whom
 we had letters of Credit; we met with a
 very kind reception, and they appear-
 -ed hearty in assisting us, and they in-
 -formed, that the goods sent from Phila-
 -delphia where safely arrived a few
 days ago, and were in the Public Store.
 The [drawing of a sun] Deputy Quarter Master informed us
 that he would send them up to Cornplan-
 -ter's Village, which was at least 140 miles
 by land, and abundantly more by Water.
 that it was a very lucky time for them
 to go, the River being neither to low nor 
 too high, so that the prospect of things
 looks a little more lightsome. 11th Had an interview with General Wilken-
 -son this Morning, he recieved us very
 respectfully, appeared well satisfied with
 the business we were going on, and cheer-
 -fully disposed to Assist us in our undertak-
 -ing, he gave us the Deputy Quarter Master ,
 who bore us company, direction in our
 hearing to forward our goods to Cornplan-
 -ter’s Settlement, he kindly invited us to
 come and take Dinner with him, which
 kindness we acknowledged, but excused
 ourselves on account of our Business. All hands were now employed in procuring
 the necessary articles to be sent into the Indian
 Country, Isaac Crage the Deputy Quarter
 Master, was very assistant, he provided
 a Boat, Sent a Wagon to take our goods
 from the Public Store, which was in the
 Fort, and went with us there; he also sent
 the Wagon to convey those we had pro-
 -cured in different parts of the Town; we
 got all our goods to the Warf Wharf,
 Weighed, and put on board before evening, 
 the whole of those sent from Philadelphia
 and procured in this Town Weighed about
 4700, for which the Boatman was to have
 20/ Per £ for taking them up to Cornplanter’s
 Village, which we afterwards understood
 from him was 270 miles by Water. He
 agreed to set of with them in two or three
 days, & let us know it would take him 18 days
 to go up the River to the Settlement. We expect to set off in the Morning, but
have first to wait on General Wilkinson 
 on a particular occation before we Start.
 This Town consists of a number of Streets, cross-
 -ing each other at right angles, and contains
 more than 200 Houses, many of whom which are
 large Brick and Stone Buildings, —I have
 observed since I came to this place, that Stone
 Coal is the common fuel for Firing, our
 landlord informed us it was the Cheapest,
 though the neighborhood abounds with Wood,
 it comes to the fire in large, hard pieces,
 looks black and shining, and makes a
 strong hot fire. I have frequently saw seen for 10 miles back at the sides
 of Creeks &c where the Edges of the Rocks were
 washed bare, stratums of Coal mixed with 
 Stratas of Slate. 12th A Cold Morning and Smart white fros[t]
 Several of our number waited on the Ge-
 -neral this Morning agreeable to his re-
 -quest, which was a satisfactory interview,
 and to encourage the business we were
 going upon and assist therein present-
 -ed us with the following letters, accompa-
 -nied us through the guards, and respectfully
 took his leave of us. Head Quarters PittsBurgh may the 12 1798

 am in heart your friend. Ja: Wilkinson 
 Commander in chief of the
 Troops of the United States Being now ready to depart, we took
 leave of several of the first Characters of
 this place, who wished us success, and
 affectionately bid us farewell. —we then
 crossed the Allegeny River at the Town, and
 a little below the Fort, it was a clear, beau
 -tiful stream, about 50 perches wide and
 6 feet deep, has much more of a Current than
 the Monongahela, and contains more water.
 we now entered a Wilderness Country but
 little inhabited the settlements not more
 than 2 or 3 years old, and scarce of provision
 for Man or horse, — for a few miles after we
 Crossed the River the land was very good, but in
 the general it fell short of the Idea I en-
 -tertained of it. in this days ride the 
 Land was generally hilly though not with such Sharp
 pitches as about Red Stone, tho as we advanc-
 -ed northward the Hills decreased, in
 places thinly timber'd, yet little or no pos-
 -ture to be seen, White Oak the most general
 timber, in the latter part of this stage, and
 through the neat, stoped and fed at Dun-
 -kins 18 miles, and got in the evening to
 a place called the double Cabbin 15 miles
 here we could get neither, pasture, hay, corn,
 or Oates for our horses, but having a little
 Oates with us, after feeding them, we tyed
 them to stakes &c till Morning, after par-
 -taking of some of our own Victuals, we
 wrapped ourselves in our Blankets and
 tried to get some Sleep on the earthen floor
 being all the bed we could meet with, 33 miles 13 We were stiring betimes this morning, as our
 bed was not inviting to indulge nature, and in
 7 ½ Miles we came to a poor Cabbin, here we
 got some Oates for our horses, and let them
 pick a little in the Woods, but we found
 a great Change since we left Redstone, the
 Season is abundantly backwards; the
 leaves are but Just putting out, and there
 is next to no picking of any kind in the
 Woods, that it looks likely our horses will even 
 much Suffer when we get among the In-
 -dians, if not before, We took breakfast of our own
 provision, and proceeded on 12 miles fur-
 -ther, where after feeding our horses, we took din-
 -ner in like Manner, and got to Fort Fr
 Franklin before sunset four O Clock, 14 ½ miles
 pretty much fatigued, part of our road being
 tedious and rough, and we sensibly felt the effect
 of our poor nights rest. we met with but
 few houses in this days ride, the Country
 has been pretty level except about Sandy Creek
 and since, which Creek we Crossed 3 miles
 back, most of the Land in this days ride that
 presented in view was of a thin Quality, and
 in places very Stony, White Oak has been the
 Principal Timber, with a large Quanty of
 Chesnut as we drew on this way, the greatest
 part of which was bloom down for miles to-
 -gether. — The town of Franklin is situated
 close on the South Side of French Creek,
 it contains perhaps 10 or 12 log houses, they
 were built under the Cover of an Old fort,
 which is now demolished, and a new one
 erected ½ a mile lower down the Creek Just
 above its Junction with the Allegeny River.
 after feeding our horses, and getting our dinner 
 two of us waited on Captain Fowler , and
 presented General Wilkinson’s letter, which
 upon his reading, he manifested great respect
 and a full disposition to comply with its
 contents, he kindly invited us to come
 and take breakfast with him tomorrow
 morning 35 miles 14 This morning we breakfasted with the Cap-
 -tain agreeably to his request, and got of
 him 4 Bushels of Corn ½ a £ of flour and 2
 Quarts of Salt, the Corn to feed our horses with,
 through the Wildnerness, and the flour &c:
 to take to the Indian Village, and Joseph
 Johnson a Surveyor to the Holland Company
 who was going to the mouth of Conowanga, within
 15 miles of Cornplanter’s Village, he agreed
 to pilot us thither, and procure us a guide we
 from that place to the Village. after getting
 our dinner at the Tavern where we put up
 last evening, we took our departure, being
 willing to leave this dear place, having had
 to pay 3/ a meal for Victuals, 4/ a night
 for each of our horses for at very Coarse hay
 15/ a bushel for Corn, and Yesterday we had
 to pay as high as 15/ a bushel for Oates. We Crossed French Creek close creek by the town I thoug[ht]
 it was as large as three of Brandywine,
 in 2 or more miles we turned to our right
 leaving the main road that leads to
 Casawaga, La Boeuf, and Preaque isle to our left,
 we had stones with a rough country for
 a while, in places very poor, in about
 12 miles we crossed a rich bottom on a
 small stream, here was plenty of pasture, being
 the first we had seen in the Woods since
 we left home, from thence to Oyl Creek 
 through level Rich land, 6 miles, here
 we met with an house, being the second
 we have seen since we left franklin,
 here we and took up our horses quarters, and
 after feeding our horses with some Corn
 turned them for the first time into the
 Open Woods, there being plenty of Grass
 and other luxuriant growths. This is the
 most desirable place that I have seen for
 many miles back, a fine fertile bottom on the Creek
 with plenty of level plough land adjoining, which
 appeared good, a large stream of Water
 not far of, and a noble Spring Just by the
 door large enough to turn a Mill, yet it is not
 known that there is any limestone in this neigh 
 -bourhood, neither have I seen any since we
 left Pittsburgh. Oyl Creek is so named from
 an Oyly substance that is gathered of its water
 either from Springs that rises near its mar
 -gin, or from off the stream in different pla-
 -ces, we were informed that one man gather
 -ed three Barrels last year, and which he sold it at
 Pitts-Burgh for four dollars Per Gallon, it is
 called Seneca Oyl, and is in great demand
 as medicine. 15 A large White frost which has been the si-
 -tuation of the last 5 or 6 mornings, set of for
 Broken Straw a large water. about two miles
 of very good land down the waters of Oyl Creek
 we then entered a White Pine Forrest, being
 the first worth noting since we Crossed the
 Mountains. here the the Holland Company
 is erecting a Grist Mill, a Sawmill being
 already put up, though there are but few houses
 within 20 miles. we have had a cut road ever
 since we left Pittsburgh to this place, which
 now ending, we entered the Wilderness with
 -out any path, a number of trees being mar
 marked last fall, they were now to be our
 guide; it was a thick wood we had to pass
 through, with a great quantity of brush, and
 young stuff in the way, our Journey this day
 was truly wild and romantic, having a 
 continual succession of Logs to Cross, sometime
 three in a pearch, divers of which we had to
 Jump our horses over, and with difficulty got
 round others; in places such a a large Jumble
 of large stone or Rocks, that we were in con
 -tinual danger of getting over Horses legs
 fast, or broke in the Cavities between the Stones
 presently we would have to descend banks
 almost Perpendicular in Swamps, and
 then out again as difficult, and there gutts
 were very frequent, the roots of the Pine
 and Hemlock trees were also very trou-
 -blesome, the ground in many places being was
 laced over with them in a Rough Condi-
 -tion, the underbrush and limbs of the
 Trees were another very great difficulty,
 as were some very steep hills in the latter par[t]
 of this stage, it was called 24 miles which
 we thought were very long ones, for it
 took us 12 hours industrious traveling
 including about an hour we turned our
 horses out to try to pick a little grass tho but
 next to none was to be seen in this days
 ride, nor one house for 20 miles, the land
 was heavy timbered but not a kindly
 soil, and I think will not be settled for many
 years to come. many natural curiosities
 presented in this days ride, one of which 
 was the large quantities of green moss
 which covered all the Rocks, the Stones
 the Old Logs and the whole surface of
 the ground, under the thick forest of
 the Pine trees, I thought the Coat of
 moss for thickness and length resembled
 a fleece of Wool, some large rocks 12 or
 more feet high, thus shielded over, and
 receiving seed from the neighboring
 trees, which the seed haveing sprouted, took root,
 and grew to be large trees, of 2 or 3
 feet over, 3 or 4 such trees I have seen on one
 Rock, and their Roots have spread down its
 sides 10 or more feet until they underfeed
 have joined the ground and grown firm there-
 -in, so that the sides of the Rocks has was were bound
 with them like so many large Ropes. We
 arrived on Broken Straw in the evening
 where we found plenty of pasture for our
 Horses, and a Cabbin, that was erected last
 summer, the Owners of which kindly let
 us have Quarters, and directed where the
 best pasture on the Creek was, to turn
 our horses too, we had provision with us which
 after partaking of, we Spread ourselves
 on the floor, to take some rest, which we
 found Small enough for us and the family 
 and the night being cold, and the Cabin
 very open, we often had to rise to mend
 our fire. 24 miles 16 Set of for the Mouth of Conowango, went
 7 miles down the Eastside of Brokenstraw
 to the Allegeny River, the bottoms on the
 Creek was rich, and beautifully coated
 over with a luxuriant vegetation, and
 loaded with lofty Pines, Sugar trees, White
 Walnut, Buttonwood &c, here we saw several
 Sugar Camps erected by the Indians, where
 they come in the Season to make Sugar, tho
 more than 20 miles from their Village, but
 we found when amongst them that they have
 plenty of good Canoes, so that the could with
 great facility convey their Kettles &c for
 making Sugar, down the River and up this
 Creek, we passed by two or more Cabins Settlements
 as of white people as as we went down this Creek to the River,
 but saw none after we turned up the River
 to the mouth of Conowanga, where we arrived
 about noon, it is called 18 miles from this plac[e]
 to Cornplanter’s Village, and a very rough
 road, so that we agreed to stay here until
 morning, there being pretty plenty of
 pasture for our horses, and a good house
 for ourselves to Quarter in, though we had to find our own provision and sleep on the floor near the mouth 
 of this Creek on a beautiful dry plain there
 is a Town laid out by the State of Pennsyl-
 -vania, it is called Warrentown, the Hol-
 -land Company owns a large body of land
 adjoining this place which they are Surveying
 into Townships &c. and settling, they have
 built a good house on a lot in sd Town, where
 they keep a store to supply their Survey-
 -ers and Settlers with Provision &c. Joseph
 Johnson our Pilot have had the charge of this
 Store, and this was as far as he designed
 going with us. When we arrived here we
 met with perhaps 20 or more Indians, many
 of whom were drunk, having obtained
 liquor of some settlers that were at this
 House intending in a few days to go up
 the Creek to their destined spot, Joseph John-
 -son immediately put a stop to the selling
 of Liquor, and informed us, that he and his
 men had obtained from the use of it distilled spirits in there
 surveying business last summer, as was the
 practice of other surveyors in the Holland
 employ, and found they were better without
 it. he agreed with a Young Indian who
 was sober, and we were informed would not
 get drunk, to Pilot us tomorrow to Cornplan-
 -ter’s Village, he was a good Countenanced lad, 
 and appeared pleased with the charge
 assigned him 15 miles 17 A pleasant day, set off with our Indian guide
 he could not talk English, nor understand
 any that we knew of, in less than 2 miles
 we Crossed the Conowanga a beautiful
 Stream, which flowed along with a gentle
 Current, we thought it was nearly as
 large as French Creek, for about two miles
 after we crossed this Water, our the land was
 good, but from thence to the Allegeny Rive[r]
 perhaps 8 miles, we had a rough Mountainous
 Country, and I think much of it a poor
 thin Soil, we had with a number of very steep
 hills to Ascend and descend, our road
 was better Calculated for an Indian pat[h]
 than traveling on horseback. we had there was a
 great abundance of Windfall timber to
 cross, we thought on an averidge, one or
 more for every two perch, some we could
 get round, and others we jumped our horses over. When
 we arrived on the River we stopped a while
 to let our horses eat grass, there being a great
 plenty on some of its bottoms, which was
 a pleasing sight, and had a tendency to re-
 -move some fears, which attended when in the naked Woods
 where no grass was to be seen, that our 
 Horses after their hard Journey, when we got a-
 -mong the Indians must suffer for want of
 provisions. while here a number of Indi-
 -ans came by in Canoes, who stopped to see
 us, Shook hands with us, and looked pleasant.
 one man came down the Mountain to us with
 a large turkey on his back, which he had
 Just Shot, we thought it would have weigh-
 -ed more than 20 Lb. the sight of this convey-
 -ed an Idea that small game was plenty a-
 -mongst them, and it was likely we should
 come in for Shares, one of the Canoes also
 had a quantity of fine fish in it. but we
 found when amongst them that a Turkey
 was very seldom taken, or any other small
 game, & it is rare to see a Squirel in the
 Wilderness, we saw some pheasants, but no
 partridges, neither did we see fish
 while amongst them but once. After
 a short conference on the weighty business
 we were embarked in, we proceeded up
 the River, not without some exercise of
 Mind, and would have been glad to we could have
 sent a messenger forward to have inform-
 -ed the Chiefs of our coming, but this was out
 of our power, for none of the Indians we
 had met with could talk English, we there- 
 -fore moved forward with or minds atten-
 -tive to best direction, when we came in
 sight of the town, many Indians appear
 -ed in view, looking toward at us, our guide
 turned into the first Cabin he came to,
 and would go no further, but point-
 -ed to Cornplanter ’s house, we paid him
 one dollar for what he had done, and
 moved forward; we presently saw the
 Chief with a number of other Indians
 coming toward us, upon our riding up
 to them and alighting, they appeared to
 welcome us with open Countenances.
 we did not know Cornplanter , nor could we distin-
 -guish him by his dress, but upon shaking
 hands with one that stood foremast we as
 Asked if it he was Cornplanter , he in-
 -formed us, in his, way that he was the
 man, after shaking hands with them
 all round, we were conducted to his house
 which was not distinguished from the rest, only butby being
 larger, and after unsaddling our horses,
 and carrying in our Baggage, and be-
 -ing seated, Cornplanter , his Son Henry 
 and Several others came in & sat down, 
 The Chief presently asked us, if we would
 like to see his people in general Council,
 we let him know that we would, as soon
 as it was Convenient, and tomorrow at
 10 OClock was therefore fixed on for the time; and
 runners dispatched immediately for
 that purpose. to give notice. It was two O’clock when
 we arrived here, and sometime after the
 above Conference, Cornplanter came into
 our apartment, and asked us if we could
 eat in the Indian way, we informed him we ex-
 -pected we could, and he presently we had some
 Dinner brought in some dinner in a bark bowl, and
 a Tin kettle, the bowl was placed on the
 seat beside us, and the kettle on the ground
 before us, and we were invited to eat, we
 saw the bowl, and the kettle, but what
 was in either of them we knew not, or
 whether they were to be eaten together, or
 separate, the bowl contained a number of
 round lumps of something tied in Cornhu
 -husks, two dumplings were tyed in one
 set of husks, with a string at each end
 and in the middle, we let them know that our
 Ignorance was such, we did not know how
 to begin, which set some of the younger sort 
 a laughing, but the Chief took
 out his knife, for they had set neither knives,
 forks, or spoons, and taking up the
 Dumplins he cut one of them in too,
 then striping up the Cornhusks, with
 his knife he cut off a piece of the dump
 -lin, and and which diped it it in the Kettle, which
 we found after contained Bears Oyl, and
 eat it, we followed the example, and made
 a light meal, the Bears Oyl was Cold and
 not grateful to our Pallates, but we have
 seen since, seen this way of eating is often prac-
 -ticed among them; the Cold Indian Bread
 dipped in the Oyl is more frequently used. 18 Last evening after we had lain down to
 rest, Cornplanter and his son Henry 
 came into our apartment , and informed let
 us know he would like to know what we intended to say to his
 people in Council, we informed told him we would
 give him an Opportunity of information
 >him in the Morning, which this morning we
 complied with, we and let him know we could
 not tell all what that we should say, for we be-
 -lieved on such occasions it was right to
 wait on the good spirit to be directed.
 We read to him the Certificate sent by
 us from the Indian Committee which 
 particularly pointed out our business,
 also General Wilkinson ’s Letter, with which
 he appeared satisfied, his son Henry 
 who has had an English Education in
 and about Philadelphia, enterpretted
 for us, for his Father can neither speak
 nor understand English, Henry was our
 enterpretter on all occations whilst a-
 -mongst them, he was not ready, and we
 believe the business we went on suffer-
 -ed some for want of one better qualifyed
 about 12 O’clock between 30 and 40 of their principal
 men met in council, which Council Cornplanter open
 -ed by a short speech, expressing his satisfaction
 on seeing us coming riding through the bushes,
 and that it was the good spirit which preserv-
 -ed us in our long journey, for which they were
 very glad. He then informed us of their Poverty, the
 poorness of their houses which were covered with
 bark, and their inability to make good ones, we
 thought the latter part of this speech was calculat-
 -ed to draw our Charity. he then let us know
 that they were all met that who were were likely to attend,
 that their Women could not come, but the Men
 would let them know what we said to them: we
 had having particularly requested their Women might at-
 -tend. We then opened our business by letting 
 them know the love of their Old Friends the
 Quakers have for them, and our willingness
 to take a long Journey to see them, some of us
 having left Loving Wives, and tender Child-
 -ren, with Comfortable dwellings, and ex-
 -posed ourselves to the hardships and difficulties of a
 perilous Journey, with no other view than
 for their improvement. We then read the E-
 -pistle or instrumental of writing the Committee sent,
 which particularly opened the design, and cause
 of our coming amongst them, it was read by para-
 -graphs and interpreted with some difficulty.
 We next read General Wilkinson ’s letter, then
 droped some advice, wishing them, when the took
 our proposals into consideration, they would
 guard against discouragements, that might
 present, in their looking forward, towards
 a change in their manner, of living for we did not
 doubt but there might be many difficultie
 in their way, and their progress might be slow
 yet there are accounts in the Writings
 amongst the White people, of a people who
 lived beyond the great waters, in an-
 -other Island, who a many years ago lived
 much like they do now, yet were no by in-
 -dustry and care become very good
 Farmers, and Mechanicks of all kinds 
 and from that people, many of those fine
 Leggons, with the other striped and nice Cloath-
 -ing they had on, came.* upon our letting them
 know we had nothing more to say amongst
 them at this time, they informed us they would
 take our proposals into consideration and
 give us an answer tomorrow. 19 The Indians were this day in Council on
 the business we had laid before them, they
 divers times sent their deputies for us to
 explain some part of the business we had
 opened to them, one of their questions was
 how they should draw their Plough if the *We then let them know that we had a boat com-
 -ing up the Allegeny River, with various
 kinds of goods, among which were a num-
 -ber of Ploughirons, Hoes, axes, Shovels and
 Spades, with Carpenters, Masons, and Coopers
 tools, which we intended never to take a-
 -way but leave amongst them, but while
 our Young staid, they should be placed
 under their care, to lend out to them as
 the wanted, and, when done with them, to be return-
 them -ed. 19 The Indians were this day in Council
 on the business we laid before them, they
 they divers times sent their Deputies for
 us to explain some part of the business 
 we had opened to them, one of their ques-
 -tions was, how they should draw their
 Ploughs, seeing they had no Oxen, we
 let them know we had seen two Horses run-
 -ing about their Town, and that was e
 enough to draw one Plough, and that if
 they would save some of the Money they
 were to get of the White People they might
 buy a pair of Oxen, and they would draw
 another Plough; and that our young men
 would lend them there Horses sometimes,
 that we did not expect any great matters from
 them at first, and that these would do to make
 a beginning, with this answer they appear-
 -ed pretty well satisfyed, tho we thought it
 was very evident it was not such an one
 as the Question was artfully calculated
 for. at another time the told us we must
 wait with Patience for an answer, for
 it was a great thing, and they were all
 consulting about it in their Houses. About
 five OClock they informed us they were nearly
 ready to give us an answer, and wished to know
 if it would suit us this evening, we let them
 know tha we were waiting their time, but as
 the day was far spent, left it with them to
 Judge whether this evening would be suitable.
 about Six 30 of them met us, the opportunity 
 I thought was owned, a degree of solemnity at-
 -tending, and after a short pause Cornplanter 
 opened the Council, the following being the
 substance of his speech. Brothers the Quakers, 
 Listen no now to what I
 am going to say to you. – You know
 brothers the Red people are poor, the great
 Spirit has made them of another language,
 so that it is very hard for us to understand
 one another plainly, as there is no person
 here that can interpret very well. 
 Brothers, 
 we take great pains to settle
 the proposals you made to us, but we differ
 in Opinions, and we must take great
 pains to have every thing compleat 
 Brothers,
 we suppose the reason you came here
 was to help Poor Indians some way or other,
 and you wish the Chiefs to tell their Warriors
 not to go on so bad as the have done, and
 you wish us to take up work like the white
 People, now Brothers some of our sober men
 will take take up work, and do as you say,
 and if the do well, then will your young
 Men stay longer, but some others will not
 mind what you say 
 Brothers,
 we cant say a word against you
 it is the best way to call Quakers Brothers.
 You never wished our lands, you never
 wished any part of our Lands, therefore we are
 determined to try to learn your ways, and
 those young men may stay here two years
 to try, by that time we shall know whether
 Morris will leave us any land, for last summer
 we sold our Land, and we dont know yet
 whether we shall get what we reserved, or
 wether we shall get our Money, but by that
 time we shall know, and then if they like
 it, and we like it, your young men may
 stay longer.
 Brothers,
 if your young Men stay here we
 want them to lern our Children to read
 and Write. 
 Brothers,
 Two of you are going home
 again, if the hear any thing about our land,
 or our Money, they must write to these young
 men here, and the must tell us if we are
 like to be Cheated.
 Brothers,
 this is all I have yet to say. We exchanged our satisfaction with their an-
 -swer and let them know our young 
 Men would want a house to live in, and a
 piece of good Land to work, that so they
 may be able to raise their bread. For
 which purpose we wanted desired some of their
 Chiefs would to go with us, to look about their Coun-
 -try, and conclude where would be most ad-
 -vantageous to the nation for our young
 men to settle down on, and that we would
 wished to see their nation in general
 Council once more before we left them.
 Upon our letting them know we had no
 more to say, Cornplanter desired his
 People would all come and shake hand
 with us, he himself first setting the ex-
 -ample, 20 and 1st of the week, we had some conversati-
 -on this morning about sitting together
 in " religious retirement, and thought
 it would be right to inform Cornplanter ,
 that if he or any of his sober people
 enclined to set with us it would be ac-
 -ceptable, tho the prospect of such an
 undertaking felt weighty, before we were
 fully concluded, the Chief with his son
 Henry came in to our appartment, and
 said he hoped we would not think hard 
 at their not keeping the first day as
 the white do, for they could not read
 and Write, that they were poor and had
 to work on that day, and that they were
 often out a hunting and had to attend to
 their Game, we let him know, that we
 intended about 10 OClock to sit down
 together in stillness to wait on the
 great spirit, and if he or any of his
 sober people would come and set with
 us it would be acceptable. near the
 time appointed Cornplanter with seve-
 -ral other came into our appartment, he
 sat very still until the opportunity closed,
 they others sat quiet a while and then
 withdrew, our door was being open during
 the Opportunity, they Indians as the passed
 by looked at us, but shewed no lightness 21 got up soon this morning to bake some
 bread, that we might be in readiness by 7
 OClock, to go up the River about 10 miles
 with some of the Chiefs, to see were it would
 be most suitable to make a settlement, we
 found it a trying Circumstance rightly
 to Judge what was best to do on the Occa-
 -tion. Jeneocatego the Town where we now
 are, being the place of Cornplanters re- 
 -sidence, is in the middle of a good spot
 of Land, in Pennsylvania on the West
 side of the Allegeny River, about five
 miles South of the New York line, the said
 Tract is Cornplanters own privet pro-
 -perty containing, including two Islands,
 near 800 acres Acres, on this Tract most and near
 it, most of the Indians under his superin-
 -tendency lives, which, with the goodness
 of this Land, being a fine fertile soil,
 was a weighty consideration of making
 this the place of settlement, there are
 also a large number of Children here
 fit for schooling, so that with much con-
 -veniency a large school might be
 made up, but to ballance these advan-
 -tages, we considered the Land was pri-
 -vet property, and if we made improv-
 -ments , such as building a house and
 Barn, and Cleared land, when we left
 it they would all belong to Cornplan-
 -ter, and not to the nation; also if the
 Indians where to clear land and fence
 lots, they would not belong to the Nati-
 -on. this consideration made us believe
 it would be best to look elsewhere. – 
 The Nation owns 42 Square miles on this 
 River, beginning at the Pennsylvania
 Line, the lines of the reservation is
 not yet Run, but we found the Indians
 have a choice that it should ly on the
 River, half a mile wide on each side.
 about 9 miles from hence up the River lat-
 -terly stood a Town called Genesinguh-
 -ta, the Inhabitants of which Village a
 few years since mostly removed here,
 about 10 miles further up the River we
 understood a settlement had latterly
 been made, from the best information
 we could get, thought somewhere a-
 -bout the Old Town would be the most
 suitable place to fix on, it being about
 half way between the upper settlement and
 lower Town, according with consider-
 -able exertion about 9 OClock we got Cornplan-
 -ter, his son Henry , and three other
 Indians to embark with us five in
 a Canoe, they put us up the River with
 setting Poles at the Rate of 3 miles an hour.
 in places the River was Shallow and
 ran rapid, in other places from two
 to six feet deep, we pased by a num-
 -ber of Islands, some pretty large, which
 appeared rich, were grown over with grass
 and other herbage very luxuriant, the 
 flats on each side of the River appeared
 much of the same quality, tho none of them
 appeared were wide; in about 6 miles we
 came to Cornplanters sawmill, we stop-
 -ed at his request and viewed it, the
 Mill is almost new, built on a Small
 Stream, which when we were there
 was so low that the Mill could do very
 little work, and at the time of Year that
 the Stream is pretty full, the River is
 often so high that it hurts the mill with
 its backwater, in about three miles fur-
 -ther up the River we came to the Old
 Town, three or more families yet re-
 -main here, we thought there might be
 150 or more acres of a flat that has been
 mostly cleared and worked with Corn,
 part of which is grown up with Hazels
 &c and part with grass, that in a few wee
 weeks would do to mow, and some of the
 richest sorts of it are put in with
 Corn this Spring; it doth not appear to
 have ever been fenced, and at certain
 stretches it is mostly subject to an overflow.
 it the tract lies on the Northwest side of the River.
 the flat is about 40 reaches wide, and then 
 commences Timber Land, mostly White
 Pine, suitable for building, or Railtim-
 -ber, which Timberland within 60 perch-
 -es of the flat we thought pretty good, lies
 very well to the sun, with a gentle Assent,
 and clear of stones; when Viewing this
 land, and taking its local situation in
 -to consideration, we were united in
 believing, that somewhere about near
 this place would be best to make our
 settlement; upon informing two of the Chiefs
 who bore us company, that we thought
 across the upper end of the cleared flat from
 the River back, taking in part of the Wood-
 -land, would be suitable for our purpose,
 and that if they liked it, to tell us, and if the did not
 like it, tell us so, and we would look farther
 where it would suit them better, they said the
 had informed us that all their Land was be-
 -fore us and that we might take it where we liked it
 best, and expressed their full satisfaction
 with our choice, Cornplanter then said, this man,
 meaning one of the Chiefs that was with us,
 lives in this Town, and he is like one of
 us, he you, a sober man, & drinks no Whiskey, and he is very
 glad our the young men are coming to live a-
 -mongst them so near him. We informed the Chiefs that
 our Young men would want timber for 
 to build a House, for Rails, and for fire-
 -Wood, to which they readily consented, say-
 -ing, they would be very glad they would cut
 all the Trees down, and further Liberty
 they would give them, if they saw a Buck
 swimming across the River, or running
 through the Woods they might shoot him
 or if they saw any fish in the River they
 might cath catch them, we then returned
 down the River with Cornplanter to his Village 22 This Morning resumed the consideration of what farther pro-
 -positions we should make to these people
 in order to their additional encourag-
 -ment in Civilization and Aggreculture,
 and mutually agreed upon some, which will
 be inserted in their proper place. –- This afternoon Cornplanter presented us
 with several kinds of seed Corn suitable for
 this Climet; divers kinds of beans, and
 Garden seeds, such as Watermelons, Pump-
 -kins, Cucumbers &c with a quantity of
 Potatoes for to Plant, these he said had been
 sent in from the different houses as a
 blessing to begin with, we thought the
 hearty good will with which these were
 presented manifested a full approba-
 -tion with our undertaking, there were
 more of each sort, except potatoes than we 
 wanted to plant, and upon informing
 him so we were answered, that we
 must take them all, for they were
 sent in for that purpose. 23 We are now our own Cooks, dishwashers &c
 Lining on our provisions that we brought with us
 from Pittsburgh and Franklin, Cornplanter ear-
 ly informed us early after our arrival how that
 they were scarce of Corn, occationed as he
 said by an uncommon overflow of the
 River last Spring, sometime after their
 Corn was come up, and by an early Frost
 in the Fall. When enquiring for meat
 Bacon at Pittsburgh to send up in the
 boat, we were informed that it was unne-
 -cessary to carry send meat here, for there
 was a plenty in this place, however
 we thought but not best to trust to an un-
 -certainty, and have therefore 120 Lb
 of Bacon coming up in the Boat. upon
 enquiry since we came here, we find me
 meat is not to be Obtained, about one
 pound of dryed meat, and four pounds
 fresh is all we got of the Indians while
 amongst them, so that the prospect of things 
 as to provision looked a little gloomy, ou
 our Boat is not being expected up in less than
 9 or 10 days from this date, but upon Corn-
 -planters informing, that he had several three
 Barrels of flour in his House, that
 he brought up from Pittsburgh, and
 when ever we got out of meat, on lit-
 -ting him know, he would supply us; we
 felt relieved. We agreed with Cornplan-
 -ters sister to supply us with three Quarts
 of Milk a day at 8 Per Quart York Cur-
 -rency, but she presenly let us know
 two quarts was as much as she could
 spare. We also got one pound of but-
 -ter, such as it was, of her, at 2/. The Chief gave us
 some Sugar, and some we purchased of
 the Indians at 1/6 Per Lb. we have a pret-
 -ty Comfortable House much to ourselves, Corn-
 -planter has two Houses they stand about
 10 feet apart, tho Roofed over between as the o
 other parts of the House which is with
 Bark, this Space between the Houses serves
 for an entry, and a place to pound their
 Corn under put their Wood &c. out of
 this entry a door opens into each apart 
 apartment, that asigned us 30 feet
 long, the other 24, and each 16 feet wide.
 they are built of Round Logs, or Poles,
 let in close together, the net Chunked
 or plaistered, so that we found our
 end pretty open and cold enough before
 morning, upon our informing the Chief
 they had better make their Houses titeer,
 plaistering up the Cracks, he replyed
 if they made their Houses too warm,
 they would not like to leave them when
 Winter came to go a hunting. along
 each side of these Houses, from the door
 to the opposite end, ran Births, or
 Seats, they were about four feet wide
 and one foot high, they were covered
 with Boards, and on these Deer-
 skins were spread, and these were
 their Beds, they also make a pretty
 good Seat, and are always ready,
 over these Births, about five feet
 high, are Shelves of the same width
 of those the births beneath, which serve to put 
 their Kitchen furniture, Corn &c upon,
 the fire is built on the ground in the
 Middle of the House, this part between
 the births not being floored; there is a large
 hole left in the Top of the Roof for
 the Smoke to go out at, which hole
 makes a pretty good Window. -– As
 far as I have observed the above descrip-
 -tion answers for most of their Houses, tho
 they are not so large, nor double, like this, they
 are mostly from 12 to 15 feet Square,
 with a shed before the door, there
 are perhaps 30 such houses in this Village
 and a number more down the River
 out of Sight, and some above, the
 Houses are beautifully situated on
 the West side of the River, which
 is about 150 Yards wide and glides
 along by the town with a gentle current.
 the bank of the River is low, tho gra-
 -dually asscends to there Houses, which are
 mostly within 6 or 7 pearchs so that they
 readily supply themselves with Water 
 there being no springs on the flat where
 the Town stands, which flat is a Sandy
 loam, easily tilled , and if well managed
 would be very productive. there are 50
 or 60 Acres of Land adjoining the Town
 nearly cleared, the most of this which is put
 in Yearly with Corn, Beans, and Potatoes.
 the Work is all done by the Women with
 Hoes, they were very busy while we were
 here, much of the Land was grown up
 with Grass, with Weeds &c, they go round
 the Old Cornhills, which were very high, as
 I have observed it is the general practice
 to have a hill when finished near one foot
 high, and hoe the grass and weeds clean
 away, then dig a hole where the hill stood
 and plant in the same place, and sometime after
 the Corn comes up, the hoe all the face of
 the ground over, so that it looked very
 neat. they plant beans with their Corn, also a
 large quantity that they stick poles for,
 they also plant Squashes and Pumpkins among
 their corn - The Women since we came here worked
 hard, they found all their Corn, for homi-
 -ny, and for Bread, sift and prepare it,
 Cut and Split all their Wood, and Carry
 it home on their backs near a Quarter of 
 a Mile, make all there fires, and all
 other Kitchen Business, plant and take
 care of their corn, and gather it when ready,
 Plant their Beans and stick them, and
 as far as I can learn all other out
 doors work, except building their houses
 and Splitting the Rails that the Corn
 Land is enclosed with. It has been a
 busy time since we came here, the Wo-
 -men have rose early, gone out with
 their hoes to the Cornfield 4 or 5 in a
 Company, some of whom where Old Gray
 Headed Women, and some young ones of
 8, 10, or 12 Years of age, stuck pretty
 Close to their Work, returned in the even-
 -ing weary, and go early to Bed. one
 old Gray Headed Woman I have seen
 steadily on the move, she has had both
 her feet so froze that she goes altogether
 on her knees, I have seen her carrying
 in wood and making the fire, going to the Ri-
 -ver and Bringing up water, I have seen
 take her hoe and go 40 pearches out to 
 the Cornfield, and return in the Even-
 -ing with the Labourers, and put her
 hoe by, and all this while the Men are
 spending their time in Idleness, such as
 shooting with their bows and Arrows at a
 mark which is a very great recreation
 with them, pitching of Queats, Jumping,
 playing at some kind of Games, and on
 Musical Instruments, and loitering about
 so that I have not while in this Village seen
 either Man or Boy at any kind of Work,
 to se little Girls, and Old Women working
 hard with the hoe, and boys of 12, 14, or 16
 just by them all day a playing, looked
 unnatural, hard, and to me very grevi-
 -ous. The Men at seasons go a hunting, and
 at times a Fishing, and they Work the Canoe,
 at which they are very handy, there is very
 little game of any kind at this season of
 the year brought in, I have seen but one
 deer all the time we were among them
 and, I have seen no kind of any small
 Game, except the Turkey heretofore noted.
 the Catch a few fish, yet but little was
 done at it while we were there, 
 so that they live poor, their chief subsistence
 at this season was Corn, beans, and Bears
 Oyl, in different preparations, much of their
 Corn and Beans, were pounded into an ho-
 -miny, and Boiled, this I thought was
 their Chief dependence, they also pound
 Corn and Beans in to a flour, and make bread
 of it, they also boyl it in dumplins, which
 they eat with Bear Oyl by dipping it in,
 as they do also with their Bread, they
 also sometimes put Oyl in there ho-
 -miny, they also at times puts sugar in
 it, with which it eats very well, but
 from my observation they eat much less than
 than we do, a small piece of Bread or dum-
 -plin dipped in the Oyl seemed to satisfy
 nature, and there seated meals I thought
 were not more than two a day about
 10 or 11 OClock, and in the Evening, if any
 of their friends came to see them, the Visit was
 not interrupted with Cookery, or much
 Cerimony in laying the table &c. if their hominy
 was boiled, which was generally the case af-
 -ter 11 OClock, the day through, and it was
 not material whether Cold or Warm, and
 some of their acquaintance came in, the 
 Births always made a seat ready, wheren
 they were presently engaged in smoak-
 -ing and talking, and while thus busily
 employed, a kettle of hominy with
 a large Wooden spoon, is brought and
 set down on the Ground before them, he
 that is most handy to it lays by his
 Pipe, and in a few minutes appears to be
 satisfyed with his repast, and moves it on
 to the next, while the rest of the Company
 are engaged as if no Victuals were
 near them, thus the Kettle passes th
 through the Company in a little time,
 and when done with, hung up, until some
 -body else comes in, if they have no
 hominy, the Bread, or dumplin, goes
 round in like manner; there is no
 trouble of laying, or clearing the ta-
 -ble, or placing of Chairs, Wiping the knives
 and Forks, or Changing of plates, but in
 a simple and easy manner all that
 cerimony is avoided. In their Cloathing and Dress their turn
 is for something tawdry; such as a gay hand-
 -kerchief, Calico shirt, Scarlet Leggons,
 Blue Coat, or petticoat, a belt of lively
 coo colours 
 decorated with Beads tyed round their mid-
 -dles, or knees, with long ends hanging
 down, the are very fond of trinkets of
 various kinds in there noses, and Ears,
 the Men more particularly. I have seen bobs
 of various kinds hanging there noses
 to the weight of an Ounce, or more, coming
 down over their Mouth. the Warriors
 have the rim of their Ears cut round,
 and loaded with different kinds of
 Toys, until the hang down several
 Inches. I saw one man with two padlocks
 in one Year, such as are used for Saddle-
 bags, another with a Watch, such as
 Children use. large silver Crosses are
 also made use of. their Calico shirts are
 short and & have ruffles to their sleeves
 & Bosoms. the Men and Womens are both made
 in the same form, they come a little lower
 than their Hips, and hangs loose at the
 lower end, the Women wearing their
 Petticuts Petticoats over under them, which
 petticoats are mostly made of blue
 Cloath, without any needlework, exept
 the stitching some red Worsted binding 
 on about 9 Inches of the upper part; their
 way of making and putting them on is, to take
 a piece of Cloath perhaps 1½ Yards long
 turn down the upper part as above described, which
 part is spread over with Ribbons,
 then Wrap it tite round them, and
 tye it with a string, their shift as
 mentioned, hanging the out side, such
 who suckle lift up their Shirts for the Child
 to get at the pap, which Conduct to those
 who are unacquainted with it may look
 immodest, but it is not the case, for
 a Child is so suckled, and less of the
 Mothers skin shown than is customa-
 -ry among our farmers Wives, - With all their tawdry and liveliness in
 dress the go dirty, I thought the Women
 more particularly so than the Men, per-
 -haps from their working harder, and
 being more among the grease, some of their shirts
 don’t appear to be ever Washed, and
 about their Sholders the become very
 black and greesy, from their greesy
 heads; their hair I have observed to be
 the Cloath to wipe their greasy fingers 
 in, while eating their bread and Oyl.
 thus for want of a change of Cloaths, and
 living in their dirt, they become very
 lowsy, which they try to extrecate them
 -selves from, by pulling of their shifts,
 turning them inside outwards, and
 hunting the Vermon with as much com-
 -possure, and seemingly good grace,
 as a Mother amongst us would do, in 
 combing one of her Children, and this
 part of their dirt has not been one of the
 least of our trials, neither have we any
 expectation of leaving them, without
 carrying away some breeders. For more than two weeks past the weather
 has been very dry, part of the time a Cold
 north wind, we had frost for ten Mornings
 successively, during which time we slept
 in open Cabins, in our blankets, so that
 we sensible felt the want of more cover-
 -ing, and a better Bed before morning.
 for two or three days past the weather has
 been warm, with a strong South wind.
 the Woods has been much on fire dur-
 -ing this dry weather, Clouds of smoke 
 have frequently covered us, so that the
 Sun has been hid. A curious Sight present-
 -ed two nights ago, of some neighbouring
 Hills or rather mountains that were on fire,
 perhaps the had not been burnt for seve-
 -ral Years, and the great quantity of dead
 timber, both standing and laying down,
 having taken fire as it passed along,
 which made a very lively appearance in
 the night, looking as if the whole Mountain
 was on fire. – We have been under
 some exercise for a few days past concern-
 -ing our goods, which are coming up
 the River, we have ing very little cause to
 expect their arrival before the last of
 this Month, and the dry weather has
 been such for some time past, that the
 River has fallen very fast, which the
 Indians remarked to us with some degree
 of seriousness, saying that it would be
 with difficulty the Boat could be ~
 brought up some Shallow places, but in
 the midst of our trials we have still
 been favoured; a considerable quantity of
 rain fell last Evening, tho no diffi-
 -rence yet appears in the River, there 
 is some reason to hope it will rise. We intended to have set of this Morning
 by Eight OClock for Genesinguhta, and
 and agreed with Henry Obeal last
 evening to go with us, and be our en-
 -terpretter; it is now eleven OClock, yet nei-
 -ther he, nor his Fathers family have got
 their breakfast, tho we have been hurry-
 -ing him for two hours past, about 12 two
 of us set of on horse back, the other three
 having started an hour sooner with
 one Indian in a Canoe; we rode the
 River one mile above the Town, and
 went up the Eastside of it, to said Town
 our first 3 or 4 miles was through an Open bot-
 -tom, thinly timbered, and good riding, then
 passed through thick Timber, a large quan-
 -tity of which were Sugar Maple, thence
 through a thick Forrest of Hemlock, and
 pine, very difficult to pass, to the shore
 opposite the place of destination; here we
 again rode the River tho wide and
 deep, we stoped at the House of a Chief who
 went with us to our inten ded Settlement,
 here we met with our friends who went 
 in the Canoe. We viewed an Empty house
 that on stood near our Settlement, we
 but not liking it, we proceeded to ano-
 -ther that was on it said settlement wherein a family
 lived, we understood they proposed
 leaving it, and would sell their right,
 upon conferring with the Woman, who
 we understood was the owner of the
 house, she was willing to part with the
 house but having put in a few spots
 with Corn and Vines, the whole not more
 than 3 or 4 pearch Square, she was appeared
 unwilling to relinquish them, and they
 were so in our way, that we thought we
 had better look elsewhere for a settlement,
 but upon the Chiefs conferring with her,
 she was willing to part with each of the
 spots except one which was not much in
 our way, and we understanding she
 was a sober Woman that would be likely
 to make good use of the Money, we paid her 20
 dollars for her house and previligdges,
 and with our assistance she removed out
 and in less than an hour we had possission 
 our young men gave it the house a thorough cleaning,
 and before dark our scanty furniture was
 arranged for House-keeping, and having
 supped on our preparations, which admitted
 of but little change, we prepared for bed in
 our open house, and naked Walls, the Indi-
 -an Chief at our request sent us three
 deerskins with the hair on, which which
 we placed for our Conveniency, and re-
 -tired, but we sensibly felt before morn-
 -ing the want of a better bed and more Clothes.
 the night being cold we were under the
 necessity of rising several times to re-
 -new our fire. Our house is about 20
 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 6 feet high to the
 Square, Covered with bark, and a shed over
 the door, and finished within as is usual
 in Indian buildings, it stands on an ele-
 -vated spot within five Pearch of the River,
 on its Northwest side, the soil about
 it said house is of a light sandy quality, easy to be
 tilled; but further from the River is lower
 ground, which and appears more fertile. Our horses since we came among the
 Indians has run out, without enclosing: 
 they have had pretty plenty pretty of Coarse grass, and
 other herbages, but here they have plen-
 -ty of grass, and that which is very good. 24 Our young men this morning planted
 some Potatoes, and they are now pre-
 -paring some ground fit for the Plough, for
 Corn, having when we came up borrow-
 -ed some tools of Cornplanter . we had
 a present of fish this morning, on which
 we expect deliciously to dine, - Our
 Young Men have prepared some bobs
 in order to try to catch some Eells
 this evening, set of up the River
 with a Canoe, but there being a con-
 -siderable rapid to ascend, which for
 want of more experience in working
 the vessel, they fail’d getting up, the Canoe
 turning across the Stream in such a
 manner, that it took in Water, and
 presently turned bottom upwards, so
 that some of them got very wet, which
 put an end to their Eel catching; shortly
 after they returned we had several very
 heavy showers, wich which convinced
 us our house was not proof against 
 Storms, for the rain beat in at the end,
 Roof, and other places. –- We have been keeping house about a
 week, and experience much inconveni-
 -ency for want of the arrival of our
 goods, having but five Tins, three
 Spoons, and a Camp kettle, we have a
 small frying pan which we borrowed
 of the Indians, dish cloths, and towels
 we are much at a loss for, as we are
 for Soap when we wash our Cloaths,
 the want of something to knead our bread
 in is sensibly experienced, which would
 not be the case if we had Tools; when
 we fry our meat, or our fritters, we have
 neither Dish, nor plate to put them on, but oc-
 -cupy bark. We brought Bacon with
 us from Pittsburgh, which we have us-
 -ed very spareingly, it is nearly run
 out, and our Cheese quite. we have no pros-
 -pect of supplying their place until our
 goods arrive. we have a little flour left
 that we brought from Franklin, Cho-
 -colate & Sugar that we brought from Pitts-
 Burgh, which are our chief living and depen-
 -dance. as we have received some Sugar of the 
 Indians as a present, and some we pur-
 -chased, which we find a pretty good sub-
 -stitute for butter, and Cheese, by bitting
 a bit of Sugar, which is in a hand cake,
 with our Bread. – while at the lower
 Town we got 2 Quarts of Milk a day,
 but since we came here we have re-
 -cieved none, nor are there ever a
 Cow here. –- 25 several heavy showers last night, still
 wet this morning, about 10 OClock, it clear-
 -ed away, put up some fence to keep our
 horses of the Indians, Corn, as what
 little they have put in here, lies unen-
 -closed. the River has been rising all
 day, so that there is plenty of water
 for our Boat to come up. 26 mostly busy in getting a spot of land
 fit for the Plough, and some other
 necessary preparations, one of our
 number has been busy in plaistering
 the Cracks of our house, it having
 cleared up from Northwest last even
 -ing, and our house being very open
 we suffered with the Cold. I may just note that there is a great appear-
 -ance for strawberries here on some part
 of the Old Indian fields. 27 and 1st of the week, I neglected noting in its
 proper place, that fifth day last about 11
 OClock we retired into our humble Cabin,
 and were favoured to witness the over-
 -shadowing Wing of Consoling goodness,
 to the Comforting and contriting of our
 Spirits, and this day we had a like Op-
 -pertunity, and were I thought alike
 favoured, may such seasons be remembred
 with gratitude, and with thankfulness and may
 our young friends be encouraged &
 strengthened to keep up such religious
 oppertunities when we are far separated, which I
 trust they will. this is the fifth day since
 we came to this Town, we brought but
 little provision with us here, having
 but little to bring, and had a hope we
 should have been able to have got
 some dryed Venison of the Indians here, which has
 not been the case, we got a little Bears Oyl
 of them, but that article is scarce, and
 dear, this day intending to have made 
 a dinner of some flitters, our Bread
 being nearly out, and our flour so re-
 -duced as to discourage attempting to
 bake; while we were frying our
 flitters, an Indian man came in
 in and presented us with about four Pounds of fresh Ve-
 -nison without any bone in it; part of
 which we immediately fryed, which
 with our flitters made us the most a-
 -greeable dinner we have met with
 in the Indian Country, we sat down
 to it with thankful hearts for so unex-
 -pected a supply. we gave the Indian
 a Quarter of a dollar, for his Venison,
 which he recieved with an apparant
 reluctance, but as he could not speak no
 English, we were altogether at a loss
 to know, whether it proceeded from
 what we gave him being too much, or
 too little, but the same afternoon he took
 three of us down in a Canoe to Corn-
 -planters Village to attend a general
 Council that was to be held there
 tomorrow, he took the Money with him
 and gave it to Cornplanter , and said
 something to him in Indian, which being
 was, that the Venison he brought us was 
 a gift, and he wished not to recieve any
 money for it, and the money was handed back
 to us, which we immeadiately presented to
 him for his the his trouble of bringing
 us down in his Canoe, which he reciev-
 -ed with Chearfulness. 28 Two of our number whom we left at Genesin-
 -guhta to take care of our horses, House &c.
 came down this Morning, and a number of
 Indians being Collected, about 12 we met them
 in Council, there being between 30 and 40, six
 of whom were there most respectable Women, early
 in the Oppertunity Cornplanter made a pretty
 length speech, which it did not appear to be di-
 -rected to us, which our interpretter informed
 was for an Indian then in the House, who
 had been charged with Murdering a White
 Man, for which he had been in Jail at
 Pitts-burgh, and tryed for his Life, but be-
 -ing acquitted by the Jury, he was now at
 Liberty; the trial and Court expences, we
 understood had cost Cornplanter more
 than 200 dollars; tho there was not evidence
 to support the charge, yet there was cause to fear
 it was too true, and the Chiefs speech appear-
 -ed to be delivered with much earnest, and
 serious expostulation. Cornplanter then 
 directed his speech to us, expressing his satisfaction in see-
 -ing us all in good health, then informing, some
 of his People were gone out a hunting, &
 if we had any thing to propose to them
 they were now ready, being all collected
 that would come. After a Short time of
 silence wherein we felt an earnest tra-
 -vel, we might be renewedly favoured,
 a suitable introductory speech was made
 on our part, and then the following con-
 -clusions of the 22nd were read, and enterpret-
 -ted To Cornplanter and all our Indian
 Brothers of the Seneca Nation, now living
 on the Allegeny River. Brothers,
 We have now been several days
 among you, and have had Councils with
 your Chiefs, and Wise Men, and have had
 looked about your Country, and agreed
 upon a place for our Young Men to be-
 -gin upon, and we are glad and thank
 -ful to the great Spirit, that every thing
 we have proposed for your good, has been
 so agreeable to your Minds, that we seem
 to agree together like Brothers, having
 but one mind in every thing that we 
 do; and we hope Brothers, we shall con-
 -tinue to be of one Mind about all the things
 we have been speaking to you of. Brothers, you know the place we have chosen
 for our Young Men to begin upon, at Genisengh
 -guhta, and we hope some some of your young men
 will settle by them, and fence of lots for themselves
 as they see them fence of theirs, & our young men
 will be willing to assist and instruct them in work-
 -ing their lots; And we think our young men will
 will not be able to raise any more of their lot
 this year, than what they will want for themselves
 to live on; but we hope against another year
 they will have a little to have; and we are willing
 they should give to your old and inform people that
 cant work, one bushel out of four of all the grain &c
 they have to spare, Brothers, in order to encourage you still more to
 take up work like the White people and to
 follow those ways we pointed out to you,
 we will agree to help you a little more. Brothers, we will send you Smiths Tools,
 when our young shall Write us word you
 stand in need of them. Brothers, if you are industerous this Sum-
 -mer and raise a good deal of Corn and
 some Wheat, we will help you to build a Grist-
 Mill next summer, if a suitable place can
 be found for it; you must find half the Mo-
 -ney to build this Mill, and we will find the 
 other half; and we hope Brothers, you will
 save some money you get from the White
 People between now and that time; that
 so you may have your share ready against
 next spring; and we think you had bet-
 -ter choose one of your Chiefs to keep this
 Money for you, till the time it is wanted;
 or perhaps your Money may be all gone,
 for Whiskey or something that wont do you
 so much good as a Mill would. Brothers, we are also willing to encourage you
 to take up work, and learn farming, by
 agreeing to give some small premiums to
 such of our Indian brothers, who are indus-
 -terious and raise a good deal of Grain. Brothers, we will give to every Indian Man
 living on this River, who shall raise
 25 bushels of Wheat or Rye, in one Year
 on his own land not worked by white peo-
 -ple the sum of two dollars. 2nd. For every 50 bushels of Corn raised by one
 Man in like manner afforsaid, we will give
 two dollars. 3rd. For every 50 bushels of Potatoes raised
 by any one man in like manner aforsaid,
 the sum of two dollars. 4th. For every two Tons of hay raised as
 aforsaid, and put into a Stack or Barn,
 not being Mowed or drawn in by white
 People, the sum of two dollars. 5th. For every 12 Yards of linnen Cloath made
 by any Indian Woman, out of Flax raised
 on her or her husbands land, and spun in
 her own house the sum of two dollars, to
 be paid to the Woman. 6th. For every 12 Yards of Woollen or Lindsey
 Cloath, made by any Indian Woman, out
 of the Wool of her own, or her husbands Sheep
 Spun in her own hourse, the sum of two
 dollars, to be paid to the Woman. Brothers, we will give you these premiums for
 four years, if our young men stay here so
 long; upon these conditions, that the person
 so applying who applies, for the Premium,
 must produce a Certificate from two of the
 Chiefs, signifying the quantity of Grain,
 Cloath,&c for which the premium is de-
 -manded; and that it was raised or made in
 the manner aforsaid above mentioned,
 and that the person so applying has not
 been intoxicated with Whiskey, at 
 least for the term of six months before
 that time. -- And our friends Henry
 Simmons, Joel Swayne , and Hilladay Jack-
 -son are hereby authorised, and desired
 to pay the above Premiums, agreeably to
 what is herein before expressed. -- We then were favoured seriouly to
 expostulate with them on various subjects
 retative to their Moral, and Civil Con-
 -duct, particularly there excessive use
 of Strong drink, divers instances of
 which we had been Eye witnesses of,
 since among them, several of their Wo-
 -men had having been thus disguised; some of
 them appeared Solid, and heard us
 with attention, but as far as I have ob-
 -served since among them, little or no
 Shame covers an Indian for getting
 drunk. -- They informed us they
 would withdraw a little while into ano-
 -ther Room, and confer on our propos-
 -als, which doing, in about an hour
 they returned, and made us an answer
 in substance as follows, Brothers, we now hear all what you would
 wish to do among us; you are come here
 to see us Brothers; you wish us well; you
 wish us to become as the White People;
 the White People are rich and got every
 thing, the Indians are Poor, and got have
 nothing. Brothers, you told us one thing; it be
 good for us to build a Mill; we must
 find 400 dollars, and you will find
 400 dollars. Brothers, we cant say but few Words
 at this time about this Mill; we
 will consult Captain Chapin , if he
 thinks we will recieve our money;
 and will be able to raise the money you
 propose, then we will do it Brothers, we know how far you have come
 to see us, it is a great way; from the
 Seashore where our forefathers once liv-
 -ed: the White People have cheated us,
 and got our land from us, and now 
 we have but little left, we will try to
 learn your way. Brothers, you know there are some
 bad People amongst us, and you know
 we have been cheated, and that makes
 us bad, and our Minds uneasy; if we
 had not been cheated we should have
 been very rich People, and had plen-
 -ty of every thing, and then our Minds
 would be easy, and we could think on
 the good Spirit. Brothers, the reason I mention to you a-
 -bout our being Cheated, some of my War-
 -riors wont mind what I say unto them;
 but will have their own way, because
 they know I often have been Cheated
 by the White People; If I had never been
 cheated, then my Warriors would believe
 me, and mind what I say to them, but
 now they wont mind. Brothers, we cant all go to work at once
 some of my Warriors will go a hunting
 to get Provisions, and sometimes they broke 
 a Gun, and then it takes a great deal of
 money to get a new one, we have very
 few Hoes, and Axes, and such things amon-
 -gst us, and we are not able to get them. Brothers, I will go along with you to Canan
 darque, and there we will get matters settled
 about the Mill, and bring it back to your
 young men in Writing. Brothers, this is all I have now got to say
 we will now Shake hands. At the close of this speech we expressed a few words
 more, representing among other things the un-
 -reasonableness of their present practice, of
 their Mothers, Wives, and Sisters, working
 all day in the fields, and in the Woods, with
 their hoes, and axes, whilst they themselves
 were at the same time playing with their
 Bows and Arrows &c recommending to them
 to begin our way by early setting their boys
 to business, taking them out to how Corn &c
 thus by early habitting them to Work, their
 Minds will be turned to it, business will
 become familier, and they will not think
 hard of it. and as they expressed the White
 People were rich and had plenty, we let them 
 know it was by industry it Was obtained
 the men doing their share of business
 in the fields, &c thereby leaving the Wo-
 -men more time to attend to spinning,
 sewing, darying &c in the house. We concluded with seriously impressing
 on their Minds the remembrance, that
 it was from the good Spirit they re-
 -cieved every good thing, and that he
 could hear every good Word they said,
 and see every thing they did, and if they
 were good, and industerous, this good
 Spirit would love them, and bless them
 with many good things. In a few minutes
 after we had concluded, and informed them
 we had done, Cornplanter Observed, now
 all things were done, and settled, we
 will cover up the Council fire. We had no provision of our own here,
 therefore concluded to stay and dine with
 the Chief, about five Oclock we had a
 loaf of Warm Indian Bread with a mix-
 -ture of Beans that had been boiled till
 they were softish nea kneaded up in it
 the Bread and baked that was set before us, the
 bread had been was baked in a Dutch Oven 
 having a small quantity of Bears Oyl put
 into the oven with it, and when part
 baked the loaf was turned over with a
 fresh supply of Oyl, we t this was all we
 had set before us; they informed us they had no
 meat, and we had heretofo shewn our dislike
 to bread diped in Oyl; however with a
 good Appatite it went down very well, but
 before we had fully done a little butter was
 set before us on the Table that they had obtained some
 -where in the Village. -- We now got half
 a £ of flour of Cornplanter for which he
 made no charge, and four Quarts of bears
 Oyl of his wife, which she claiming as her
 property charged us half a dollar a Quart,
 these our Young men took up this evening with them
 to Genesinguhta, together with what
 Chocolate we had, this evening; leaving
 John Pierce and myself here to wait the
 arrival of our goods 29 In the council yesterday we informed the
 Indians that John Pierce and myself expected
 in a few days to be at liberty in a few days
 to leave them, and return to our families
 and Friends; and since the concluding 
 of the Council we see nothing but what
 we might set of in a day or two if our
 goods were arrived come; we have not
 heard any from of them since we left
 Pitts-Burgh, but hope they will shortly
 arrive, as tomorrow closes the 18th day,
 being the time stipulated for there delivery coming
 here, -- Our situation is diffirent from
 what it was when we were here al-
 -together, we then had a room much
 to ourselves, and cooked our own
 Victuals, we now board with Corn-
 -planter, who uses us kind, and as
 well as his house will afford, We have
 >had Tea made of the Root of Sassifras, also
 of an herb like fern, and thin cakes
 of wheat Bread baked, or rather fryed
 in a pan they eat very well, so that
 we have no cause to complain of our
 living if it was not for their dirt, and
 their lice &c which try’s us. --- we enquir-
 -ed Our road from Pittsburgh here, was
 pretty much of a Northeast coarse, and 
 part of it very rough and tedious, so that
 we have been desirous of finding a 
 nearer, and better way home, we early en-
 -quired of Cornplanter if there was any path
 from this Town across the Mountains to
 the big Island on Susquehanna at the
 mouth of Baldegle Creak, he informed us
 there was a path, but it which was but little
 used, and through a rough uninhabited
 Country, we should have to lay out at nights,
 carry provision for ourselves, and some for
 our horses, and that it would take us five
 days to travel it and it was so Moun-
 -tainous and rough, that it would be with
 the greatest difficulty we could get our hor-
 -ses along, we then enquired for a way to
 Canandarque, and how far, he told us it was
 160 miles, and not a very difficult road,
 that he and his Son Henry were going
 there in a few days, and he would be
 glad of our Company; we had felt some
 little draft in our Minds to go home by O-
-neida, and Canandarque being in the way which made the Chiefs proposal of the 
 Chiefs, of bearing us Company to Canandar-
 -que feel pleasant, but about this date a
 runner from the Chiefs of Buffaloe, arriv-
 -ed at Cornplanters Village with a mes-
 -sage to him, desiring his attendance
 there as soon as he conveniently could
 for the Surveyers and commissioners from
 Robert Morris and Company were coming
 to run out the land the Indians sold them
 last fall, and also to run and settle the
 lines of the Indians reservations, they
 Chief expressed a great desire John Peirce 
 and myself should go with him to the
 Council and attend there while the business
 was transacting, which upon weighing, we
 let him know we felt a freedom comply to go
 with him. -- While we were writing
 this afternoon we heard an uncommon
 noise, which caused us to look out to
 see from what it proceeded, where we
 saw a Man in a frightful Dress, we
 then walked out more fully to view
 the sight, where we saw two Men
 with naked Arms, Thighs, and legs,
 they had Bearskins on their backs 
 which hung down below their hips, and
 tyed together across their breasts, and on
 their head they had a grim and Terrible
 appearance, this false face, for so it was
 called, was made as frightfull as nature
 could invent, the hair on its head hang-
 -ing forward and over the face; the Mouth gr
 grinning, large, and much aside; the
 nose, and Cheeks Wrinkled and very
 Huge; the Eyes set around with tin to re-
 -semble the uncommon stearing, and the
 whole face painted red and black, each
 of these Men had in their hands a stick
 of about 8 Inches in length fastened
 to a shell of a Water Tortise, the which
 Shells had some small stones or other
 hand substances in them, which made
 a great rattleing: which noise was much
 much increased by their reubbing
 them against the Logs of a certain
 house where they appeared to be sta-
 -tioned as guards the whole conduct of these
 Men were appeared to be truly frantick.
 a large number of spectators at a consider-
 -able distance surrounded the house where 
 where the men appeared to be plac-
 -ed as guards, many of whom were young
 Men, who endeavored to peep through
 the Craks of the Logs into the House, and
 these guards used their great exertion
 to keep them off, or to catch them, it look-
 -ed dreadful to fall into their hands, which
 made the Young men use great endeavours
 to avoid it, I asked our Young interpretter what
 would be the Consequence if any of them
 should be taken, he said they would put Ashes
 on their Heads, and very much dgrade
 them, we saw a number of elderly Women go-
 -ing into the house, whom these monsters quietly let pass
 from which Circumstance and some others,
 we were of the mind there was a women in
 Labour in said house, and this Wild scene
 was transacted, as a Ceremony, or rejoic-
 -ing, at the Birth of a Child, or else to
 keep the Boys and Young Men from com-
 -ing nigh the house or looking in, as there
 construction was such as not to admit
 of Privacy, Our interpretter was a
 Young Man and did not seem fully to
 understand, or else did not care to tell 
 the cause of the Womens being there:
 but said they had met there for a frolic, and
 to drink Whiskey, but as far as we could dis-
 cover -cover neither their conduct, nor
 Countenances answered this description. 30 This day near 12 OClock while I was writing
 a letter to my Dear Wife and Family, Corn-
 -planters wife with an expression of Joy on
 her Countenance came into our appart-
 -ment, and pointing with her hand down
 the River expressed as plain as she could,
 Canoe, Canoe, it struck us immeadi-
 -ately that our Boat was a coming, -- 
 which was agreeable news to us we went
 directly to the River side, but not
 observing it any where in view, she
 pointed with her hand across a bottom
 is so sensible a manner, that it left no
 remaining doubt she but she had seen
 it, in a little time the Boat came
 safely along by the side of the Town,
 the arrival of which was heartily
 welcomed, both by us, and the Indians
 many of the latter gathering around the Shore, hav-
 -ing never seen such a boat before, most of them being 
 only acquainted with Canoes, the Captain
 informed us he did not leave Pitts burgh until
 three days later than he had given expected,
 that he had been fifteen days a coming, and
 that it was 270 miles to follow the Coarse of
 the River, both he and his Men appear-
 -ed tired, expressing much satisfaction they
 had gotten here, not expecting we would
 want them to go further, but when we
 let them know our house was nine miles
 up the River, and that we wanted the
 goods taken there, the submitted to com-
 -ply, with much reluctance, and not until
 we first engaged to give them three dol-
 -lars extraordinary, and half a dollar to
 an Indian to Pilot them, the Captain
 saying he was a stranger higher up the River. We have been entirely unable since our
 arrival here to have any Conversation
 with the Indians without an interpretter their being very few
 amongst them who understand any English
 & fewer who can, or will express one word,
 and our interpretter not being ready at the
 the business it was a discouragement to us, to
 touch on religious subjects. we had a 
 strong desire to know if they had any religius
 Rites or Ceremonies amongst them, and last
 evening we ha having some conversation with Cornplan-
 -ter on the Subject, he informed us, they had
 two Solemnities in a year, when it was the
 practice for their men and women, gene-
 -rally to meet together in one place; the
 first was in the spring, the other in the
 fall about the time Corn was ripe; the lat-
 -ter as a time or rejoicing, and to re-
 -turn thanks to the great Spirit for this
 Blessing. the did not keep the first day
 of the week, but every one tryed to think
 good in his own Mind; and as we could
 he queried read the Bible he queried
 whether there was anything said in it
 about the Indians, we informed him the
 Bible mentioned all nations, kindreds,
 Tongues, and People, and that included
 the Indians, and we would have been glad
 to have mentioned to told him, tho the Indians
 could not read the Bible yet they were
 not Wholy deprived of the benefits of the
 coming of Christ, for that a manifestation 
 of his Spirit or measure of his Grace was
 placed in each of their hearts, and would
 if minded, or given way to reprove for
 all wicked words, and Wicked actions,
 an well also produce peace for well do-
 -ing, but this was too refined and deli-
 -cate a Subject for our enterpretter to han-
 -dle. -- I have not been able fully to
 learn what number of Indians this Village
 contains, but Cornplanter informed us
 that there were about 400 persons
 Young and Old under his Superentend-
 -ency, much the larger half of whom are
 in or near this Town; he also informed
 us, that in his whole district there were
 three horses, 14 cow kind, besides one
 Yoke of Oxen, and 12 hogs. 31 About 9 OClock this morning John Peirce 
 and myself to took our last farewell of the
 Indians in this place, and set of with
 Cornplanter , his son Henry , and a Nephew
 up the River in a Canoe, to his sawmill
 where we took leave of the Chief and his
 son for the present, with a promise that
 they would call on us at our house at 
 Genesinguhta in five days, for to go on
 with us to the mouth of Buffaloe in order
 to attend a Council there, the Nephew and
 a Son of the Dutchmans who tends the
 Sawmill, took us up to our farm, were
 we found our goods had safely arrived
 about two hours before, and were all
 unloaded and taken up to our house
 House door. in about two hours, the
 Boatmen having got their business ac-
 -complished, respectfully bid us fare-
 -well, and with Chearful Countenances
 went merily down the lively Current
 expecting in four days to arrive at
 Pitts-Burgh. -- This afternoon was spent
 in unpacking our goods, drying such
 as were wet, and stow ing them away in our
 Cabin, which proved too small for the
 purpose, however we got them arranged
 in such a manner, as to leave a pretty
 good Conveniency for house keeping, we
 now experienced a great Change, our
 naked Walls, empty house, and bare cup-
 -board, met with a rich supply; our hard
 and Cold beds, were warmed and softened 
 with blankets; we were now able to
 make a Cup of Tea, or Coffee, tho with-
 out Milk; or Butter; and we have Bacon
 or Cheese to eat with, our bread, our
 Change being so great that one of our
 Young Men says they want nothing but a
 Cow to make their living equal to Chester Coun-
 -ty. 6 one 1 We were busy this Morning in hang-
 -ing our Grindstone, and in putting han-
 -dles in some of our tools, John Peirce 
 and myself accompanyed by an Indian
 Chief went up the River in a Canoe near
 one Mile above our Settlement, to view
 a Stream that was on the Opposite shore
 which we were informed was suitable for
 to build a Mill on: upon viewing it
 we found plenty of fall, and suffici-
 -ency of Water for a Grist Mill, tho
 the stream was not large, it came down
 between some high hills, 25 feet pearch
 of a headrace would carry the water
 high enough for the purpose, and
 within five pearch of the River is a
 very suitable band to erect a mill on 
 where a Tolerance might be readily dug
 into the River so that Canoes could come
 up to the Mill door, a large quantity
 of suitable flat stone for building may might
 be readily got on the spot to do such
 StoneWork as might be thought neces-
 -sary, but against these advantages the
 Mill will stand on the North side of a
 high Hill loaded with timber so that
 the Sun in the Winter season will make
 but little impression, and the headrace
 will have to be carryed 15 or more pearches
 alone the side of a verry steep stony bank
 so that it will be with great difficulty a
 race can be made for the purpose, a Mill
 might be built 10 pearches from the River
 above the Rocks, but then Canoes could
 not be brought to the Mill by reason of
 the great fall in the Stream. we thought
 by raising a dam 4 feet high, the water
 might be taken out below the Rocks so
 as to have 8 or 10 feet head and fall.
 as far as we have been able to discouver
 streams suitable for Mills are very scarce
 on this River. 2nd This day for the first time I under-
 -took to wash some Shirts, tho we are
 housekeeping, and all our goods are
 come, yet we have neither Tub, nor Pail
 not any Brass kettle so that our Conveniencies
 for washing are few, my Shirts were very
 dirty, yet I thought for a Young hand they
 were done pretty Well. 3rd and 1st the Week, Our Young Men were
 all engaged in writing letters home, so
 that it fell to my lot to do cook and do
 the Kitchen Work. -- we are visited
 every day by more or less of the Indians
 who are much pleased with viewing va-
 -rious kinds of our goods, which satisfaction
 is increased by our giving them some little 
 matters. Two Indians, one being a Chief paid
 us a visit this Morning, and we were being employ-
 -ed in Writing and reading, and endea-
 -voured to let them know that we did not
 work on first day, tho we found it difficult
 to make them sensible of the reason
 why we cease there from, -- We shewed
 them Howells Map of Pennsylvania,
 with which they were much diverted
 and seemed to understand it pretty
 well, particularly the Allegeny River 
 and the large streams which run into
 it. -- Since our coming into these parts
 we have kept meetings twice a week, our
 opportunity to day to felt like a parting meeting,
 and a travel was experienced for the pre-
 -servation of our Young Men whom we
 expect Shortly to leave, it was a time where-
 -in we witnessed our Strength renewed ---- Some days latterly has been warm yet the nights are
 Cool, so that bedcloaths feels pleasant, since
 our goods arrived John Pierce and myself,
 who are Bedfellows, have steadily had four
 Blankets under us, and the same number
 above, yet none to many. -- We have
 had much Wet weather for a Week past,
 so that we have been prevented as yet, from
 setting the Plough to go, but if the weather
 suits, hope to start it tomorrow, having
 two Acres of Ground dearly ready. ---- The River has perhaps double the water in now
 that it had some time ago, yet nearly as clear
 as common. -- we have had to ad-
 -mire the Quantity of fog that fills the
 Atmosphere every morning, so that I do
 not recollect seeing the Sun rise clear
 since we came her. -- And as it has
 been a rainy damp time latterly, Clouds of
 fog are frequently rising out of the River. 
 the lower parts of some Mountains
 near our Settlement, which fog ascend s
 said Mountains in thick Colums un-
 -usual to what I have been acquainted
 with. 4th Much rain fell last night, the morn-
 -ing still wet, we expected Cornplanter 
 and some other Indians, to have called
 on us this Morning to set off for Buf-
 -faloe, but before Six OClock Cornplan-
 -ters Son Henry , and another Indian
 with each having no other covering on, tho raining
 fast, than a Calico Shirt, and Clout,
 arrived here, being sent by the Chief
 to inform us, that a Considerable
 number of Indians were going with
 him to Buffaloe, who were not fully
 ready but would call on us tomorrow
 this information was more than we expected
 and was satisfactory felt fully of there not going to
 day, as it was wet, and by no means
 fit to travel through the bushes 5th The sun made its appearance 
 this Morning, and there is some pros- 
 -pect of a pretty pleasant day for traveling
 and not knowing what Minute Cornplan-
 -ter and his Company would call on us, we
 felt our Minds baptized at with the prospect
 of a seperation, and sat down together
 to take a parting Oppertunity, it was an
 endearing time of retirement, wherein
 the Canopy of divine Love was spread over
 us, to the Contriting of our Spirits, and
 a living travel was experienced, that
 as the time was we nearly approached when we ex-
 -pected to part, that Ancient good-
 -ness might be near to them that stayed,
 to Comfort, Strengthen, and preserve, in
 their lonely Cottage, and ardious under-
 -taking; which considering the many favours
 we have experienced since we set out
 on the presant business, there was
 no Cause to doubt, but as they were tru-
 -ly watchful, and attentive on their part,
 would still be continued. -- And that
 we who are going might still continue
 to experience the Lords protecting Pow-
 -er through a Solatary Wilderness, and
 tedious Journey. ---- We have been holding ourselves in readiness
 since six OClock this morning, having
 our horses most of the time prepared ready to mo
 mount with a few minutes notice, ex-
 -pecting Cornplanter and his Company
 to have called on us, but it is now
 near sunset and the have not made
 there appearance, nor sent any no reason
 why, so that we continue to find patience
 a necessary Virtue to have in possession
 we have had a few a light showers to day, but
 a prospect of a beautiful Evening, &
 a clear setting sun. 6th A very foggy morning with some
 rain, both us and our horses have
 been very much afflicted with a small
 fly or gnat since we came on this River,
 they are so troublesome particularly morn-
 -ing and evening, that it is disagreeable
 doing business out of doors, our young
 men frequently made a smoke to fend
 them of, the horses have been so bit
 with them, that the thin parts of the
 skin was all rise up in bumps. and
 we were informed, that the Muschetoes 
 and a green headed fly will be so trou-
 -blesome in a while, that horses and Cattle
 wont thrive or will rather fall away.
 After waiting with some degree of impatience
 until between two and three OClock this
 afternoon, we were visited by Cornplan-
 -ter, his Son Henry , and two Other Indians,
 the Chief informed us, that one of his daugh-
 -ters was taken very ill yesterday, and a
 relation that lived in his family had fell of a
 horse and broke his arm, which had pre-
 -vented his coming sooner, and that now
 he could not he could not go with us for
 three days on their account, for which
 he was very sorry, but if we did not like to
 wait so long, he would hire a guide and send
 with us. We informed him we were
 very sorry circumstances had happened
 so as to prevent our us from having his com-
 -pany, but believed it would be best for
 us to set of tomorrow Morning, for we
 wished to spend a few days with our friend
 in Canada, and in Seven days we hoped
 we could meet him in Buffaloe, where he
 said he intended to be on that day if the
 state of his famaly would permit, a guide 
 was accordingly provoided, who engaged
 to call on us tomorrow morning by sun-
 -rise ---- a heavy shower of rain this even-
 -ing, so our going home which way
 we will looks discouraging, on accoun t
 of getting over some large Waters; this
 River for several days past has been
 near three feet higher than when we first
 came. ---- our going up and down this
 river while among the Indians
 makes 45 miles 7th About Sunrise this Morning our
 guide, Indian John a Chief that lives in
 this Town called on us, and being ready
 to take our departure; about 5 OClock
 we took an affectionate farewell of
 our Young Friends and set of for the
 mouth of Buffaloe, we went up the Ri-
 -ver about five miles, through a very
 thick Wood, and a great quantity of
 Windfel timber, there was a large pro-
 -portion of young stuff growing up, and
 next to no path; we frequently got very
 wet from the bushes, we then left the River
 to our right and went up a fine Country
 heavily timbered, mostly white pine, having 
 a small Creek at some distance on out right
 and for 3 for in 3 or 4 miles we passed through an
 Old Indian field, thence up and the aforsaid
 water through some very good Champion land with a
 very luxuriant growth of grass, and Weeds
 of various kinds, some swamps and very
 thick wood about 4 miles, thence entred
 a rough hilly country, heavy timbred, mostly hemlock and I thought thin land for 7 or 8 miles a
 large quantity of which was down, so that
 what with the hills, the logs, the Brush &
 the swampy gutts it required patience and a good
 Stock of Spirits; I mentioned to my Companion
 sometime after we set of this this morning
 that my Mind, was uncommonly easy, cheer-
 -ful, and sweet, so that I passed along, in a
 lively and well qualifyed state to make tra-
 veling pleasant, but before Evening I foun[d]
 my stock of spirits was much exhausted. About
 11 O Clock we had a very heavy Rain, such an
 one as but seldom happens, it lasted perhaps
 an hour, so that we got very wet, when it
 abated we stopped and barked some trees
 to have a trough to feed our horses out
 of, and taking some refreshment ourselves
 we mounted, having for several miles past
 been riding over fine Champion land, a little
 hilly and heavily loaded with and timbered, we had some fears about 
 about getting over Catarawgus this morn-
 -ing before we started, and this heavy
 rain increased them; however we mov-
 -ed on over a fine country, tho a trying road
 the Limbs, the Brush and the Logs were
 ever in our way, much of the Timber in
 this days ride has been Hemlock, some
 Chesnut, Sugar maple, Beech, Oak &c but
 as we advanced towards Catarawgus, we
 had a large proportion of very fine
 poplars; when we got near to the river
 we passed through a very luxuriant rich
 bottom, with an uncommon luxuriant growth of vegetation and about sunset arrived at
 the stream, which we found to be many
 pearches out of its banks at the Common
 fording place, and our guide signed to us
 that it would run over our horses backs
 and sweep them away; we therefore being con
 -cluded to pitch Camp, we were got being in-
 to an Open bottom where there was pretty
 well of grass, so that our horses would
 have done very well if it had not been
 for the gnats and muschetoes; we struck
 up a fire, and under some Bushes, we had
 put up to keep of the due, got a pretty 
 Comfortable nights rest, having in the
 evening we viewed the river above the fording
 place, and we found that there was were some marks
 of its having fallen an Inch or more. 35 m
 we saw neither house nor cabin in this days ride. 8th Rose early this Morning, and upon
 viewing Cateragus we found it had fell
 several Inches, we therefore fed our horses
 got our breakfast, and prepared for mov-
 -ing, we had lodged on an Island, which our
 guide took us round to the head of that so
 we might have the advantage of the Cur-
 -rent in Crossing it. we found the bed of the
 Creek was wide, and there was a large gra-
 -velly Island several pearches from for our Shor[e]
 , we decended the Bank and rode
 to it, the Water not being more than knee
 deep, we then rode went down this Island 20 or more
 Pearches to where our guide singn signed
 for us to Cross, the Water ran very swift,
 but did not appear to be as deep as he gave
 us to expect, which was to come within Six
 Inches of the top of our horses backs, we
 mentioned signed to our guide to lead the way, he
 being well mounted on Henry Simmons 
 Mare the largest beast in Company, but 
 showed evident marks of fear; and the task being likely
 to fall on me, I pulled of my great Coat &
 tyed it up well behind me, and raised
 my saddlebags by putting some luggage
 under them, and having previously
 cut a pole to carry in my hand to mea-
 -sure the depth of the stream &c, I entered
 it the river without much fear, tho not without care:
 and found our guide was mistaken in
 its depth, and well for us he was, for
 had it been as deep as he expected,
 no horse could have stood before it the stream, I
 got safely through, my Companons view-
 -ing me with exercise of mind; when
 the saw me safely landed with safety the follow
 -ed, and arrived also safe with gladened
 hearts; we then pursued our Journey
 with chearfulness down the rich bottoms
 of said stream, a great number of Poplers
 large beautiful Poplars, White Oaks, Pines,
 and Blackwalnuts made there appearance
 also some fine natural Meadows of good grass,
 and in 10 miles we arrived at a Village
 of Munsy Indians in a Champion Country being the first dwellings we had seen since we left for the Allegeny hav-
 -ing rode through an open Wood for 4 or 
 5 miles past grown up with herbage of
 different kinds very thick, and near thre[e]
 feet high, we stopped at a house in this Village
 got our & Breakfasted on our own provision. The
 Town and pasture land was enclosed in
 a lot of perhaps 12 or more acres which look
 -ed Clean and pretty, having very good pasture
 in the enclosure, where were several horses, Cows and
 and swine. their houses looked pretty snug,
 perhaps 18 or 20 in number; their Corn land
 was down towards the River, the plant it
 without any inclosure, keeping their stock
 in the lot. The house we went into had
 a large quantity of Corn hanging up in it,
 considerably more than I saw all the time
 I was at allegeny, and upon enquiring, we
 understood they sell many bushels every
 year to the White People, their Vicinity to
 lake Erie, makes it easy conveying it down
 the River there, and then it goes by Water to
 new settled Countries, we were informed it
 was as low as 4 or 5 shillings per Bushel,
 which is low cheap for a new Country, we found
 in Canada and other placed Corn Rated at
 a dollar per Bushel -- Most of the principal
 Men in the Village and others gathered 
 into the house where we were, and
 their being a Whiteman living a-
 -mongst them that could interpret, we
 informed them of what we had been
 doing at Cornplanters settlement, and
 of the young Men we had left there to
 Instruct the Indians to Plough &c, and
 of friends concern for the Indians in
 general; with which they expressed their
 satisfaction, saying they took it very
 kind that we called to see them, and to
 inform them of what we had been doing
 >at Jeniscatago, for they had heard something
 about it, but they had nothing further to
 say, we then shook hands with them all
 round and bid them farewell, We then and
 turned a little to the right, leaving Cate-
 -ragus considerable to our left, and in
 about 7 miles of a very swampy teadious
 road, through good land abounding with
 Poplars, and with other timber heavily loaded,
 we arrived at Lake Erie. here we gratifyed
 our eyes in a while in viewing this Ob-
 -sequious Element as far as the Convex
 state of the globe would admit, -- here we now 
 turned still more to the right, and went
 along the beach to lake to the mouth of Buf-
 -folae 29 miles, the prospect the remainder
 remaining part of this day was pleasant, and it was
 rather heightened by our being so long confined
 in the Woods. The road was in places
 good, but in other places very heavy,
 that being a large the gravel being near fetlock deep.
 We had the Lake on our left, the surf roling
 gently to the shore in waves two or three
 feet high. On our Right was a Majestick ap-
 -pearance of rocks and stones piled up
 in verey uniform order, in places from
 20 to 60 feet high, as upright as the Wall
 of a house, and in other places projecting
 over several feet, the bottom of these
 Rocks are wore with the bearing of the
 Waves, and Sand, and Gravel, until
 they are were wore into Curious shapes, and
 as smooth as polished Marble, from
 the tops of these Rocks the water was tr
 trickling down very entertaining, I ob-
 -served some Rocks standing in the edge
 of the Water, as large over, and round
 as a Millstone, the upper part whereof 
 was wore nearly to the shape of the largest
 end of an Egg, & as round as if turned
 in a leathe. In a number of places
 the water came up to the Wall of Rocks,
 so that we had to ride 40 or more pearch-
 -es in the Water Lake in places Belly deep,
 and the Water was very dirty at the
 Shore with its beating the sand &c so
 that we could not see the bottom, and
 did not know but the next step the
 horses made might take them over
 their Backs, but what made it look
 the most romantic was the continu-
 -al beating of the Waves, which came
 up against these Rocks, and the Wa-
 -ter would at times fly over our heads
 and sufficeintly wet the traveller. The
 last 10 miles we very much left the Rocks,
 and as we advanced the bank grew lower,
 so that very high Westerly Winds raises
 the Lake water and Waves on this side the
 Lake until it overflows the Bank and
 drowns a considerable Country, which is very
 level, and Wet for Common. It was very
 evident for a number of Miles here away 
 that the Lake is gradually moving towards
 the Southeast as most of the trees which
 stand along its margin has the dirt washed
 away from their roots for 3, 4, or more feet
 deep, and so that they are dead & falling fast; and
 I thought it was as visible when on the
 Canada shore opposite, that the Land was
 gaining there. ---- We got to the Mouth
 of Buffaloe before sunset, where we put our
 saddles and Baggage into a boat wich which took
 us over, and we swam our horses through the
 River it being perhaps near 100 yards wide and
 10 or more feet deep, here we met with a compa-
 -ny of men who were going to run out Robert
 Morrises late purchase of the Indians into
 Townships, John Thomson an Old acquain-
 -tance from Delaware County being one of the
 head Surveyors, he kindly invited us to stay
 all night with them, and directed a Tent to
 be put up for us, we acknowledged his
 kindness, and accepted his offer, after
 feeding our horses we turned them out to
 bare picking in an open bottom, we were kind
 -ly entertained, with great symplycity, on
 Bread, Fish, and Chocolate; we got a pretty
 good nights rest, which we wanted being weary
 having traveled 45 miles, no white inhabitant for the last 80 miles 9th This Morning went 4 miles on the Beach down
 the Lake and the River Niagara, which is
 the outlet of said Lake, to the Narrows, wh
 were we Crossed the River into upper Ca-
 -nada, it was ¾ of a Mile wide about 16 feet
 deep, and a rough Strong Current, our
 boat was narrow and tottering, and one
 of the horses a little unruly so that we felt
 thankful when we got safely on shore, we
 then turned square to our left, up the
 side of the River to the Lake, passing
 by Fort Erie, then up the Margin of
 the Lake on a fine firm beech that made
 a beautiful Road 6 or 7 miles, then turning
 square to our right in about 1 ½ miles ar-
 -rived at Daniel Pounds , where we were
 kindly received, and felt thankful, we
 were once more among our friends. In
 the afternoon we paid a visit to Joel Mor-
 -reses, who were much pleased on seeing us,
 and in the evening went to our my Old home
 when here last fall, and kind friends
 Asa Schooly and Wife, who were truly
 glad to see us, and we them, here we got
 a clean good Bed, which was what we had 
 not experienced since we left Pittsburgh, hav-
 -ing for near four weeks slept on the ground
 and on boards, in our blankets. 15 miles 10th and 1st of the week, went to see John Cutler s and
 John Herit s families this morning, our visit
 was very acceptable, they being much pleased
 to see us, we then attended the Meeting
 held at Asa Schoolies , which was in a good
 degree a solid, quiet oppertunity, tho te-
 -dious in gathering, somewhere between
 30 and 40 persons were collected, divers
 of whom were hopefull Young Women.
 we dined at Asa Schoolies , and in the
 Afternoon, went to Joseph heavenes Haven’s &
 then to Adam Burrell s where among
 a hopefull number of Young People we
 had a refreshing time, and parted wit[h]
 this family in near Affection, thence to Josep[h]
 Marshes, who was a sweet spirited Wife, and
 a number of hopefull Children, where we
 lodged. 3 miles 10th [sic] Set of early this morning to see friends down
 the Mountain, as it is called, in 7 miles
 we came on the Niagara River, thence down
 the River close on its Margin 18 miles to the 
 great falls, having about two miles back fer-
 -ried the Chippaway River, the bridge being
 broke, it said River is perhaps 100 yards Wide 10 or 12
 feet deep with no perceptable Current.
 at the falls I once more gratified my Eyes
 in beholding this Wonderfull Phinomina
 in nature, the appearance was truly
 Solemn, and speaks a loud Language.
 but as I have given a pretty circumstantial
 account thereof in my notes when here last
 fall, I think it not necessary to add, further
 than we now went down a very steep bank
 of 100 or more feet in hight to the Table Rock
 , as it is called, which lies Horrizontal and
 runs across the River, which bank we
 we then thought not safe to descend when here before last fall
 by reason of the sleet, or Ice that covered
 the Hill, which sleet had collected from the
 mist that ascended from the Voilent age-
 -tation of the Water. It was now about
 noon and a clear warm day, the fog that
 ascended was abundantly less, than the
 Cold morning I was here before, yet be-
 -fore we got to the bottom of the bank
 the bushes &c. became very wet, and I 
 believe had we stayed on the Rock at the
 grand pitch one hour our Cloathes would
 have been nearly wet through; we had now
 a very fair prospect of the Water Shoot-
 -ing over the Rock, and its desen descend-
 -ing with very great rapidity in a per-
 -pendicular direction 150 fifty feet, and
 the foaming state of the River for many pearch
 -es below, it was a trial and looked appeared dangerous
 to go to the edge of the Rock, to look down; I
 did it by going on my hands and knees,
 and at the edge I found the Rock was
 hollow under me for a number of feet
 back, and not much above one foot
 thick, I would have been glad to have
 descended to the bottom of this pitch, but
 we had no pilat, and there was no possibility
 of getting down any where in view, nor as
 I have understood short of half a mile down the
 River and there, with great difficulty. After
 staying about 20 minutes to view this Awful &
 grand Scene, we return'd up the steep bank
 with difficulty, and in four miles arrived at
 Jeremiah Moores , where we were kindly rece
 recieved. In about an hour after we had got 
 here, in about one hour after, a friend from
 the Short Hills, came in, particularly
 requsting that Jeremiah More and John Hill 
 would come up to their Assistance, a
 difficulty having taken place respecting
 a Meeting house they were building, so that
 the Work was stoped, the friend was much
 concerned about it, as was Jeremiah when he
 heard the information, and they express-
 -ed a great desire that we would go with
 them, hoping that our assistance to accommo-
 -date matters would be very usefull; we
 had no prospect of going so far, and our
 the time for our returning to Buffaloe, fix-
 -ed, we felt cautious in any hasty result, but
 let the friends know we would consider it
 the request, and go in the morning with
 them to John Hills , which was six miles on
 the way, and where we had intened to have
 gone. 24 miles 12 Set of early to John Hills where we took
 breakfast and on weighing their request felt
 an engagement to go with them, and it was
 agreed to meet all such as could be could be
 notifyed who were concerned in building the 
 house on the spot this Afternoon at 2 O Clock
 and Joshua Gilham the friend who came do
 down and another friend went on to give
 the necessary information; we went on with
 John Hill and Jeremiah More to Joshua Gilham s
 12 miles, where we left our horses, and went over
 to John Taylor s and got our Dinner, thence
 to the Meeting house, where we met with
 most of the Men professions likely to Constitute
 that Meeting, and I think I may say it was a
 time of renewed favour, many Minds were
 tendered, and the difficulties treated on in suc[h]
 a Manner; that they appeared to be removed
 to general satisfaction, and the work agreed
 to be prosecuted, and the time fixed for go-
 ing on with it. We felt well satisfyed we had
 given up to attend, and friends expressed
 great satisfaction with our being there,
 & that they thought our Coming was Pro-
 -vidential. They have purchased 10 Acre[s]
 of Land of Samuel Taylor , part of which is
 cleared, and the house is raised and nearly
 shingled in, it is built of snug, round pine
 Logs, about 20 by 22 feet square, -- I was muc[h]
 pleased to see the faces of those we had laboured 
 amongst last fall, and found the Committee
 had left a sweet savour behind them, it
 was the general expectation of friends
 in Canada that they would have been
 again visited this Summer, but when they were
 informed the Committee was not likely
 to come, at least before the Yearly Meet-
 -ing, it proved no small trial, however
 they expressed great satisfaction that we had come
 over the River, and that the sight of a Solid
 friend did them good, it was some trial
 to leave them so soon, as there was a ge-
 -neral pressing for us to have stayed long-
 -er, and we we had were loaded much love give us in charge with love to carry back
 to their friends, particularly to such who
 had visited them. We stoped and spent a
 little time at Samuel Taylors , he has a re-
 -ligious goodlooking Wife, then went to his
 Father John Taylors and paid a short visit; and stoped & drank Tea
 at Joshua Gilhams , then went to James
 Crawfords to Lodge, 22 miles today 13 A fine Morning, set of before sunrise, abou
 about 100 Pearches above our Lodgings on 
 an eminence of perhaps 250 or 300 feet
 ellevation, we had a view of Lake Onterio
 >at 10 or 12 miles distance, also at 12 or 14
 miles distance on a strait line we had
 a fair view of the fog or Mist which
 arose from the great falls, which it ascended
 up like a Cloud, we could while riding
 along here very plainly hear the roar-
 -ing of the Water, like the Noise of a
 Mighty Wind. Went to John Hills 
 to Breakfast 10 miles, stoped at Ben-
 -jamin Hills near by, where we took an Af-
 -fectionate farewell of Jeremiah More 
 and his Wife, we we John Hill bear-
 -ing us Company, we went to William
 Lundy’s, where we dined, 5m then
 passing by the falls 2 ½ miles we rode up
 the River 12 miles, then turned to our
 right 8 miles to Asa Schoolies where we
 Lodged. 40 miles today 14 Having got our linen linen &c. Washed &
 being ready to leave Canada, I feel easy
 to make one general note of the face of the
 Country, Timber &c. As far as I have been 
 through it, in the general it is a level
 Country, while in a state of Woods, much
 of it is Wet, with a black mud on the
 top and a stiff Clay under, which
 Clay prevents the Water from soaking
 down, when cleared in a dry time
 this Clay land beakes bakes very hard &
 is difficult tilling, tho in other places the soil it
 is a loamy soil. The land in general is
 of a good quality and a fine grass land,
 good springs of water are scarce, as are
 lively runing Streams: and the Waters
 fail much in dry Weather. In places
 there are a plenty of a coarse flinty
 Limestone, but in the general few stones
 are to be seen, Scarcely a spot to be met
 with, except where it is cleaned, but what
 is very heavy, Timbered Land. I do
 not recollect of ever passing through a
 Country that has so large a proportion
 of clean, straight, beautiful White lakes
 as a considerable part of this has; there
 are also a Considerable quantity of 
 White and Black Ash, Poplar, Chesnut, Elm,
 Shellbark Hiccory, Bass Wood or Lyn, Sugar
 Maple, Beech, White Pine &c. When the roads
 are first opened and used they are mostly
 muddy, in places very deep, but after they
 have been used 8 or 10 years and the Roots
 rotten and gone, they get pretty good, tho
 at present there are amany deep places.
 as far as I can learn their Summers are plea-
 -sant tho nearly, in the daytime, as warm
 as our own are, but the evenings and
 nights mostly cool, so that a blanket & Cover-
 -lit are not often unpleasant sleeping
 under, -- there Winters are steady and more
 Snow lies on the ground than in our parts, but
 in convesation with some who moved out of
 these parts the Jersyes and Pennsylvania, they were of the Mind we have
 a many days here, as cold as any they have there,
 but we have more warm ones, their Win-
 -ters mostly set in towards the middle of the
 12th Mo, and in the forepart of winter they
 have frequent snows, until the ground
 becomes 18, 20, or 24 Inches deep, but seldom
 more, which snow continues without much additi-
 -on until the Middle of the third Month, which 
 which is their pleasantest time for traveling in
 the whole Year, they do their Carting and
 traveling much with Sleds, the roads be-
 -come smooth and good, there are no swam ps
 or mud in the way, neither is the snow
 often softened with rain in the Winter,
 some seasons they have had very little or no
 frost in the Ground; and as far as they have
 tryed Cover, they say it does answers very well, not
 being hurt in the winter, with frost. About 9 O Clock this morning we took leave
 of our kind, and Valued friends Asa Schooly 
 and Wife, with their children, hav-
 -ing their, and many friends, hearty
 Wishes for our safe return, stoped at
 Daniel Pounds , a little while, then tak-
 -ing our leave of them, and set of down
 the Lake for Buffaloe, & arrived at the fer-
 -ry about 12 where we found the Chief fer-
 -ryman, so in Liquor as not to be fit to
 take any Care, but a trusty Old man who
 sometimes Assisted agreed to take us over,
 the Wind was pretty high, and the River
 ran swift, he concluded to lash two boats
 together to keep the one our horse was were 
 in Studier, which was very acceptable to
 us, having found when we Crossed before were going
 over, that it was a dangerous ferry, and
 rocking boat; but now on our return
 we went over very steady, tho the Current beat
 us down the River ¾ of a Mile, shortly
 after we had got on Shore, and mounted, we
 saw a man at a great distance towards
 Buffaloe, coming riding towards us, whom
 we presently knew to be our Indian John 
 who was coming to meet look for us, he appeared
 much pleased to see meet us, as we did to see him,
 and to find that our Mare was safe. ---- We got to Buffoloe about 2 OClock and
 tho a Day later than we agreed to meet
 Cornplanter here, yet neither he nor any of
 his company were come, -- about Sunset
 his Son Henry , and another Indian arrived
 and informed us that Cornplanter , and
 10 or 12 more were on there way, and would
 be here by 10 OClock tomorrow, 15 miles 15 About 12 OClock Cornplanter and his
 company arrived at the Opposite side of Buf-
 -faloe, we walked down to the River to recieve
 them, when the Landed came across, they appeared please d 
 to see us, Cornplanter enquiring after our
 health since we left him, he gave us
 a letter from our friends dated 5 days
 after we came away, informing they
 were well in health, and enjoyed a
 peaceful Mind, that they had got their
 Corn planted, and were preparing ground
 for Popatoes, that there had been much
 rain since we left them, and that the
 gnats and Muschetoes were more trou-
 blesome than heretofore. Cornplanter having got some information that
 we were a little uneasy about staying
 as none of Robert Morris 's Commissi-
 -oners were arrived, he this Afternoon
 >he took an Oppertunity with us, Observing
 that he expected by this time we had seen
 enough of the Wilderness to form know, that were
 people were to be collected from diffi-
 -rent parts to do publick business, it
 required time, and he hoped if Cap-
 -tain Chapin should not arrive this evening to night, 
 we would try to make ourselves as hap-
 -py as we could, and stay a few days long
 -er, for he had a great desire we should
 be with them at the Council, and see
 that all things were settled fairly, then we
 would be able to inform our friends at home
 and if they were not settled fairly then we
 could also inform our friends. It brought
 a close exercise over our Minds to know what
 was best to do, a number of the Indians
 were collected, yet it looked likely it was
 would be some time before all parties
 would get together, as none of the White
 people immeadeately concerned were
 come. We let him know we would have
 been glad to have attended the Council, but
 it was now drawing towards the latter end
 of the Week, and that the White people did
 not do business on first day, that it was
 not very likely that Captain Chapin &c
 would not leave Canandarque before
 2nd day Morning, and that it would be a
 number of days before the Council
 would meet, however we were willing 
 Closely to consider the subject it this Evening 16 Having attended to Cornplanters re-
 -quest, of last evening, I felt my Mind
 this Morning easy to move homewards, but
 upon mentioning it to my Companion
 he said he did not witness that clear-
 -ness to set out he wished to experience
 yet condescended if I thought best of
 letting the Chief know, that upon
 weighing his request in the best man-
 -ner we could, We felt easy to move
 homewards this morning; this infor-
 -mation was given him by walking
 down to his encampment, he with a
 number of others pretty soon came up to
 our lodgings, and let us know, he was
 sorry we could not make our Minds easy
 to have stayed a few days longer, no ways
 doubting but Captain Chapin and others concerned
 would be here to day; but perhaps
 as we had been a considerable time fr
 from home, and living was expensive,
 we might be much run out of the means 
 that enabled us to stay, which made
 us so anxious to return. I informed
 him, when I left home, I expected to have
 returned in about 40 days, that it was now
 near 50 days, and if we went by Oneida
 to see the Indians there, which we proposed,
 it would take near 30 days more before we
 got could get home, that our Circumstances as
 to money was not in the way, for we had
 plenty. he said he had left home on pub-
 -lic Business, expecting to have return-
 -ed in 50 or 60 days, and it had taken him
 near a Year before he had got back, and
 that he had found it his duty to sacrafice
 privet conveniency to public good;
 and he would have us do so too:
 we let him know, the business we came
 about appeared to be agreeable settled
 to both their and our Minds, that this o-
 -ther business, was something we knew
 nothing of about untill since among
 them, that we would have been will-
 -ing to have set with them in Coun-
 -cil, tho did not know we could be of
 any use service to them, and that the 
 business between him and Captain Cha-
 -pin relating to a Mill, we thought
 when he and the Captain conferred to
 -gather on the Subject, we might be ful-
 -ly informed of their result by letter.
 he then informed us he was become per-
 -fectly reconciled to our going, and as
 the Council was expected every
 day to meet, he could not go with us
 to Canandargue, as he had proposed,
 but that John , who had hitherto been
 with us, would go through to the Che-
 -nesee River, and that he wished the
 good Spirit who had hitherto pre-
 -served us, would safely keep us on our
 Journey, until we arrived at our own
 homes, he further desired we would
 make ourselves, perfectly easy about
 our Young Men, who were left a-
 mong his People, for he would take
 the necessary care of them, and that they
 and that would be entirely safe. We now took An affectionate farewell of
 the Chief, and the Indians present, who
 parted with us with much respect; and
 I can truly say, the longer I have been
 among that People, the more near and
 united they have felt to me, and that
 now on parting, the felt like bretheren
 like with whom I have had been intamate
 -ly acquainted, and for whose wellfare
 I feel ardant Wishes. ---- About 8 O Clock we left Buffaloe, hav-
 -ing a fine day to enter the Wilderness,
 and there having been about a Week
 of dry weather, the road was this day
 pretty good, so that with industry we
 traveled by computation 45 miles. Much of this days ride was through a country
 land of very little or no thinly timbered, wich was
 grown over with plenty of pretty good grass,
 so that I thought thousands of Cattle might
 have fattened upon it, if it was not for a
 certain species of large flies, and Musche-
 -toes, we stoped twice to let our horses eat 
 grass, but they were so Worried with these
 Animals, that the did little but run about
 until we got bushes and kept them of.
 If we stoped our horses one Minute in
 some places in the Woods, the Musche-
 -toes would be on them in such swarms
 as almost to hide their natural Colour,
 and none but those who have experienced
 it the trial can rightly form an Idea, how trou-
 blesome the were to the Rider, I cou-
 -vered my head, neck, and most of my
 face with my Silk handkerchief, laped
 my Pocket do: around one of my hands
 and with all the other defence I could
 make was much bit and Swelled with
 them, -- When Night came an we got
 no relief, we took up our quarters, a-
 -bout Sunset, beside a small stream
 of good Water, under the Boughs of an
 Oak, and erected fires, in diffirent
 places around us in order to smoke
 them of, but with all our defence we
 were worried the whole night throug[h] 
 So that we slept but little, our horses,
 as may readily be supposed, fared no
 better, they would away out to eating,
 and then in a little time return trot-
 -ting back to the fire, and it was with with
 much difficulty we got them sad-
 -dled in the Morning. 45 miles 17 Set of early this Morning, being willing
 to leave Muschetoe Camp, the road not
 so good as Yesterday, having a large
 number, of deep Swamps, and about 20 miles of a thick
 woods to pass through, wherein we found no diminution
 of the Muschetoes, but about noon we ar-
 -rived in at the plains within 8 miles of
 the Chenesee River, where our horses
 could eat grass without much molestati-
 -on having left the big flys and the o-
 -ther tormenting insects chiefly behind us. We crosed the River about 4, on the flats
 of which there was a great burden of natu-
 -ral grass, and about the Road Timothy &
 Clover, the seed having droped from horses
 as the traveled along, I lodged at Pearsons
 4½ Miles on this side the River, having left 
 my Companion a few miles behind on
 special business. 35 miles. The Richness of the Soil between Buf-
 -foloe and the Chenesee River has is no
 way lessoned in my view by riding
 through it at this time, but the first
 Settlers will meet with a great trial
 in the Summer Season from the In
 -sects I have mentioned, but when the
 Country becomes Settled, the low places
 Cleared, and dry, that affliction will
 I believe cease, for I saw very little stag-
 -nated Water, -- much of this Country
 is scarce of Springs, or streams of
 Water, and what there is very much
 fails in dry Seasons, so that its va-
 -luableness will be greatly lessened
 thereby. 18th. About noon John Peirce arrived at
 my Quarters, he having since I left him
 had a full interview with Captain
 Chapin, who is the superintendant of
 the Indians for the united States, John 
 gave him a full information with of what 
 we had been doing at Cornplanters set-
 -tlement, and an account of the Young
 Men we had left there, the Captain ex-
 pressed great satisfaction with our pro-
 ceedings, and thought there was encouragement
 to extend labour towards that people, for
 he had been sometime past through the
 Oneida settlement and he apprehended he
 saw considerable improvement since o
 friends extended care there. About 2 O Clock we sat of towards Canan-
 -darque, and for 9 or 10 miles we passed through
 a thick settled, highly improved Country,
 for considering the settlement to be was no more than 10 years
 old, which to me was very animating,
 having for 300 miles past been mostly in
 the Wilderness where improvments were
 not to be seen, here we had beautiful Timo-
 -thy, and Clover fields almost Constantly
 in view, with a good appearance of wheat
 Indian Corn, flax, Oates &c. these we shewed
 to our Indian guide , he alighted to examine
 the heads of Wheat, we shewed him the flax that
 that Shirts &c. were made of, with which he
 appeared pleased, we saw four Men howing corn
 these we pointed to, telling him they were not 
 Squas, or Women, and that was the way
 the White People did their Work, he
 knew our meaning, which he expressed
 by a lively smile. We now parted with
 him, having traveled together 170 miles
 he going on for Canandarque, and
 >we for Mud Creek, he was the same Indian
 Chief who lives near by to where our Young
 are Settled, whom Cornplanter said, as
 heretofore noted, was a sober Man, like
 ourselves, he would drink no Whiskey, we
 have had some oppertunity of proving
 this Assertion, being several days
 with him at the Tavern, at Buffoloe
 were the Indians were drinking Spirits
 and I did not see him meddle with any it. We now left the State road, turning to
 our left through a Country but little in-
 -habitted, an open Woods, and thin land
 until within 2 miles of Mud Creek, here
 was heavy timber and good land, we
 lodged at Jacob Smiths who has a Mill
 and Sawmill on Said Creek on a fine
 natural fall. 20 miles to day. 19th. Went to Nathan Cornstalk s 6 miles
 through good land, heavily Timber’d
 part of which was very fine White Oaks,
 rested here untill after dinner, then
 went to Abraham Lapham ’s, 2 miles,
 where I left my companion, and went
 2 miles to Caleb Macumber ’s, who
 with his Wife are valuable young
 friends, lately settled in these parts,
 in the evening, they went with me
 1½ miles to there fathers, Jeremiah – 
 Smiths, where we lodged, 11 miles 20th Caleb and his Wife went with me to Abra-
 -ham Lapham’s, this Morning, where we
 stayed until after dinner, being among
 kind, valuable friends, and our hor-
 -ses fareing very well, render’d it an agree-
 -able time. I having in company with the Com-
 -mittee that went to Canada last fall, which visit friend s
 here in there families, and held several Meet-
 -ings amongst them, I felt great satisfaction
 in being once more amongst them, and the
 company of a Friend to those Remotely situated
 is very Joyous more specially when such love
 the Truth and are concerned to support the 
 profession they are makeing, which I
 trust is in a good degree the situation
 of a few friends here, they having been
 strengthd since we were here last fall
 to hold Meetings twice a Week; often m
 more than 30 meeting on the fist day, and
 half that number on a Week day, attending About one O Clock we parted with our
 kind friends here and set of for Oneida
 Caleb Macumber putting us on our way
 9 miles throug a country pretty thick set-
 -tled, particularly on Mud Creek down which
 >the waters of which we went, down for several miles after parting with him
 we went for 6 or more miles, we went through good
 Land, unimproved to the outlet of Ca-
 nandarque lake a smart stream, which we crossed here
 was one or two more settlements, thence to
 Flint Creek 4 miles through as good
 Land to appearance as any we have rod[e]
 through over with plenty of fine limestone
 all unimproved, here was a sawmill,
 that did a great deal of Business
 on a said large stream, which stream we Crossed the Creek
 on a bridge, thence 3 miles to one
 Woodhulls a privet house, tho some 
 times takes in tavelers, he had a
 large quantify of meadow, of the best
 of Grass and stoutly grown, tho our horses
 fare was poor, the house stands near
 the said Outlet of the Lake, Flint having
 Joined it the stream a little a piece up. 24 miles. 21st. Set of early this morning, passed throu gh
 about 13 miles, of a light soil, thinly timber-
 -ed, some of which was pitch pine, being the
 first we have seen for several hundred
 miles past, thence 8 or 9 miles through
 a very rich beautiful limeston country all
 thick Woods, we have now entred what
 is called the Mililary Lands in Onanda-
 -ga County, and I do not recollect of ever
 seeing 8 miles of Land more beautifull
 both for situation, and quality, and tim-
 -ber than this, - As I rode over it I anticipated contem-
 -plated the time, when this land will be
 crouded with We althy Farmers, abound-
 -ing with large stocks of Cattle &c. Vieing each
 other with their fields of Wheat, Corn, Grass &c
 >& regaleing themselves around their Tables
 richly loaded with provision. --- Here we
 arrived at the outlet of Seneca Lake, a stream 
 perhaps at as large as three of Brandywine, when
 we first came on the River it looked very deep
 and glided along with an easy current,
 but in a little time we came to a rapid a
 Mile in length, on which are erected
 an Elegant Merchant Mill, and a
 Sawmill that appeared to do a great
 deal of Business, the stand appeared
 to me is very valuable, as the Co untry
 round is fertile, and suitable for
 raising Wheat, salt and goods of va-
 -rious kinds are boated up this River
 to a little below the Mill, then Cart-
 -ed above the rapids, and from thence
 taken by boat up into the Seneca Lake, which is
 40 miles in length and opens into
 a very fine Country, we were informed
 that this stream seldom rises more than
 Six Inches with any fresh, the Lake
 forming a large bason which contains
 the freshes, and is which is let out gra-
 -dually, -- thence to Cyuga Lake three
 miles, here we fed our horses and cooked
 our own Breakfast, we then crossed sd. La[ke] 
 in a Boat, a little above its outlet, it be-
 -ing one mile across wide, and 13 or 14 feet deep
 we were informed the Lake was 45 miles
 long, and in places four Miles Wide, we now
 entred a pretty thick settled Country, consi-
 -derably improved, the Land still very good
 with plenty of Limestone, and in eight miles
 crossed a large lively stream which 
 is formed being was the outlet of Owasco Lake, which
 was Lake is 12 miles long and one broad; about 1 ½
 miles miles on this side we fed at one Good-
 -riches, thence to Carpenters 10½ miles over
 a very fine Country pretty well watered
 which has not been the case which has not been the case for until latterly
 many miles back which Country was considerably settled, few of
 the improvments older than four years,
 I have been much delighted in the last 15
 miles ride, in beholding the beautiful and
 well grown fields of Wheat, Clover and Ti-
 -mothy mixed, and lots of Corn, -- I thought
 one half of the Cleared Land was in with grass
 and that many farmers would cut from
 20 to 30 Tons of Hay. For thirty miles back
 I think it is without exception the best body
 of land I have seen since we left home. We
 got a five O Clock dinner at Carpenters 
 and then rode 6 miles to Lindseys on 9
 Mile Creek a pretty large stream, being
 the outlet of the Shaneatetes lake, our
 last stage mostly woods, here we Lodged
 cutting Clover and Timothy grass for our horses with a sickle
 he having no pasture. The grass is so stout, I thought it would have produce near three tons of hay to the Ac The common practice of raising Corn,
 wheat &c for many Miles past, is to clear a piece
 Land, by cutting down nearly all
 the timber which they heap and burn
 on the Spot, and when made clean, they
 Harrow the ground several times over,
 then they plant, and tend the Corn with
 the Hoe never putting a plough in the
 ground, when the Corn comes of, in the
 fall, they again harrow the ground several
 times, and then sow it with wheat and
 Timothy, and often times some Clover seed, and when the Wheat comes
 of, mow it for several years, by that time
 many of the roots get are rotten, they then
 Plough and farm it as suits best.
 49 miles 22nd.: Went 13 miles to breakfast the first
 7 good limestone land, unsettled, being
 lately purchased of the Onadaga Indians, 
 thence a few settlements: to Onadaga Creek,
 3 miles in an uncommon Valley surround-
 -ed with high hills, in said Valley a num-
 -ber of good improvements, From Lake Erie to this place a level Coun-
 -try, not a Mountain in the Whole way, nor
 very few hills that a Waggon need lock down,
 but now for about 17 miles forward the Land is con-
 -siderably hilly, and in places stony, for the
 first 9 or 10 miles pretty thick settled, with
 good improvements, from thence to Cana-
 -soraga a smart water that runs into Onei-
 -da Lake, about five miles mostly Woods,
 as here we fed our horses, and rested seve-
 -ral hours the day being very Warm, as
 we descended a long hill down to this
 place we killed a Rattle Snake about
 four feet long, as thick in the Middle as
 as a good pitchfork handle, but was
 much smaller towards its head; it was
 of a lively dark brown, conveying a mixed
 colour to the Eye, beautiful to appearance,
 it lay still in the road, neither offered to
 fight, or run. ---- In the coarse of this
 days ride, we passed within a few miles to 
 the right of the Onadaga Salt Works
 a place where there are a large number
 of Salt Springs, in a Marshy, Boggy
 bottom, we were informed 500 men are at
 times employed at these works, and that
 Salt may be had there for 62 cents Per
 Bushel, and that all the Northern and
 Western Country, and much of upper Cana-
 -da is pretty much Supplyed therefrom. from From this Stage to the Oneida Vil-
 -lage 12 miles, in about one mile we
 passed by a well improved farm, with
 a good house, Barn, and other building[s]
 and a large proportion of good Timo-
 -thy Meadow belonging to, and in the
 possession of an Idian Indian, he keeps
 Tavern, has his Sign hanging up out as
 common at Public houses from thence to the Village
 mostly Woods, the few settlement there were,
 was, one or two excepted, was put up this
 Spring, being small, rough, and very open,
 about 6 in the Evening, we arrived at our
 friends settlement, found them all well, &
 very glad to see us. William Gregory , his 
 Wife and Hannah Jackson , having got here
 about three weeks ago, after a passage of 15 days. William's Chief view in coming, was, to set
 set up the Smith trade, and to instruct
 some of the Indian Lads in that art, and
 Hannah ’s was to open a School, and besides
 teaching Literature, to instruct the girls
 in knitting, sewing, &c. neither of them
 have yet opened their occupations, in part
 occationed by some unsettlement or unea-
 -siness in the Indians Minds, in regard
 to the Sale of some of their lands, and the
 runing of their lines, Commissioners hav-
 -ing been busy engaged in the business since the
 arrival of our friends. 23 We went on foot this Morning, Jacob Taylor 
 bearing us Company, to see the Tuscorora &
 Stockbridge Indians, they Lay South from this
 place up the Oneida Creek, the Tuscorora’s
 two miles of, and the Stockbridge nation
 four, the land is good, and with a considerable
 bottom of it up the Creek, on which the
 Tuscororas are Scatteringly settled, most of
 them having some enclosures of wheat, 
 Corn, Mowing ground &c. with a con-
 -siderable number of Cattle, and some hor-
 -ses, Sheep, and Swine, which made a
 pretty Clever appearance: but on arriv-
 -ing at the Stockbridge Settlement, the
 prospect of their improvement was
 more delightful, the have a large
 Street between two and three miles in
 length, which Ascends up the middle of a valley
 one mile or more in Width, on each
 side of this street their houses are erect-
 -ed 20 or 30 pearches from each other, the
 Land on this Street is mostly cleared, and
 fenced off in small Lots, which lots were in
 with Wheat, Corn, Grass for Mowing, or
 for pasture: It is about nine years
 since they settled here in the Woods,
 their first houses are mostly small, and
 poor, some of them have latterly put up
 pretty good houses, and others are pre-
 paring for it. The have pretty good
 Gardens near their doors, and consi-
 -derable Stock, of horses, and Oxen, Cows, and
 Swine, with some Sheep. On the East 
 near enough to supply themselves with
 water runs the Oneida Creek, and on the
 West in the Same Valley a small stream,
 that so that they are well supplyed with
 Water, and towards the South end
 of their Village, they have a Grist Mill,
 and a Sawmill, their Grist mill does
 considerable work for the White People,
 and their was a large quantity of logs
 and Boards, at the Sawmill. We called
 to see most of the families of note amo
 mongst them, also a School kept by an Indian a religious Indian Man with whom I was much
 pleased, more particularily with the
 Women, many of the Women whom, were Solid,
 Sensible, and engaging. there houses
 were clean with Wooden floors and Glass
 Windows, themselves and Children mostly
 clean, and neat, and the Men and Boys
 were hoeing corn &c. I thought there was
 as much diffirence between Cornplan-
 -ters people, and this nation; as betwee n
 these People, and the better livers amon g
 the White People. We had a favoured
 oppertunity with a number of the most 
 respectable Characters of both their
 Men and Women, at the close of which,
 a Chief on the behalf of the Men pre-
 -sent made a pretty lengthy Speech, in
 Substance; expressing their thankful-
 -ness to the good Spirit who had put
 it into our hearts to remember
 them when at a great distance, and
 had preserved us in our way thither;
 that they felt themselves much Streng-
 -thened by our good Words, that they
 were sensible they had done that which
 was not right, yet hoped by the help
 of the good Spirit they would do better for
 the future, and they Wished the Qua-
 -kers, would continue to remember
 them, for they had found them to be
 true Men, and that the realy had
 the poor Indians good at Heart, and
 wished that the good Spirit would safely pre-
 -serve us on our way home to our fa-
 milies and friends. Then after a short
 pause, a Woman on behalf of the Wo- 
 men present delivered a speach much
 to the foregoing import, tho we thought it
 more weighty, and nervious, we then re-
 -turn’d to Captain Hendricks’s where
 we lodged, in a good Clean bed. 24th Returned this Morning to our friends at
 Oneida, and it being the first day of the week
 we sat with them in their Meeting. 25th Had a Council with the Oneida’s this
 afternoon, on Business that our friends here
 had been endeavouring to get them together
 about for several Weeks past, but were
 not able to accomplish it until we came,
 we made some fresh proposals to them con-
 -cerning some of their young men coming to
 work on the farm with our friends, they
 having never complyed with the proposals
 that were made, when the friends first were
 there, as the consideration therein mentioned
 they were to receive for their labour, they
 apprehended at too great a difference, it be-
 -ing such a share of what was raised. There
 were also some proposials concerning one
 or two of their Young Men coming to learn 
 the Smith trade, all which they said
 they would take under consideration and
 let us know tomorrow, then they were clos[e]
 -ly expostulated with, concerning some Jea-
 -louses they had entertained, occationed by
 some whisperings of evel Minded White
 People, who told them the Quakers had
 some deep rooted design, to make get pos-
 -session of their Lands, for they certainly
 would not have been at the great expence
 they have, if they did not expect some
 temporal advantage therefrom; they
 acknowledged they had given too much place
 in their Minds to such Whisperings, and
 that it had made them feel, to use there
 own expressions, very ugly, we let them
 know that we would not have their Land
 if they would give it to us, and that it was
 very unkind in them to have given place
 to such surmisings without they had, had
 some ground for it them, they acknow-
 -ledged they had found us to be true Men,
 that we Spoke the same words to them
 now, we Spoke two too them two years ago 
 and that they would Shut their Ears to all
 such Whisperings in future. Then said, they
 had been trying to improve in farming, and
 if they did not come forward as fast, and as
 well as we desired the Quakers desired,
 they must not get discouraged, but conti-
 -nue there care, and Assistance towards them. Upon enquiring of our young Men here, they
 informed us there was some improvment a-
 -mong the Oneida’s since they came, tho
 not such as they wished to have seen, they
 Plough more, and fence more, they sow more
 Wheat, and have more lots of Meadow. They
 are computed young and old to amount to at
 about 600, and are scattered 10 or more miles
 distant, tho their largest number is with-
 -in two miles of this place. They have a
 large enclosure here of perhaps 200 Acres,
 wherein the keep their horses, of which they
 have more than necessary, their Cows, and
 Swine; and in said enclosure are many of
 their Horses, and they plant their Corn, sow
 their Wheat and Oates, and have their mea-
 -dow lots without, but this mode of farm-
 -ing, it looks likely they will have to change
 before long, for the have sold their Lands, 
 particularly where the State road goe[s]
 within 2 or 3 miles of this place, and the
 White People are settleing on it fast,
 and they haveing put up several Houses both to the East, and West
 of the Castle have been put up this Spring
 and we saw a number Cattle in the Woods
 within two Miles of their Corn &c. There are several good houses in the
 Castle, with Glass Windows and large Piazza
 or Portico’s before the door, one of the
 Chief’s Houses is painted red, and looks
 Showy, -- The main Road from Albany to
 the Western Country goes through their
 enclosure, there being a gate hung on
 each side, many travellers stop and
 Stay all night at the Red house, it is
 called a Tavern. -- Their houses are ge-
 nerally floored, with Chimneys at one end 26th Part of this afternoon was spent in
 Settleing with the Stockbridge Indians
 concerning the Mill friends built them
 and in the evening we had a Council
 with the Oneida’s, in order for them
 to give us an Answer to the proposals
 we made them Yesterday, they informed 
 us they had found one lad or Young Man, willing
 to come and join in, on the farm, and one
 to learn the smith trade, and the Chiefs
 engaged to use their endeavours to get
 more, they also agreed immeadiately to
 Cover a shop, and burn some Coals, whic[h]
 shop they accordingly covered next Mornin[g]
 and went immeadiately to getting wood
 home for Coal, and the oppertinity end-
 -ed to general satisfaction. --- And It now
 looks likely we may set of homewards tomorro[w]
 which feels very pleasant. My Mind has for
 the most part, has been easy about my
 family and concerns at home, ever since
 I left them, but now our business appear-
 -ing to be gone through, the draught hom[e]
 feels strong: and it has been some exercise
 to our Minds to fix on the best rout to
 take, down the Mohocks River, by Al-
 -bany, and through the Jerseys, is the best
 Road, the Oldest settled Country, and likel[y]
 to be have the best accomodations, but down
 the Waters of the Susquehanna, near 100
 miles neigher. 27th Upon further Consideration we
 felt most easy to return home down
 the Mohocks River, And about one OClock
 >we took an affectionate farewell of our frd s,
 having before taken leave of the Indians,
 and set off, and passed through a thick
 Woods much of it hemlock, for 7 or
 8 miles, passed by wherein there were a few settlements, lately
 erected, but as we passed went on, improvment[s]
 became more plenty, so that in a few miles
 we got into a thick settled Country, with
 Large frame houses many of which were
 painted; and good frame Barns, such as
 would have been a Credit to an Old settled
 Country, with fields loaded with Clover and
 Timothy for Mowing, with some fields of Wheat,
 and a very good appearance of Corn, and other Spring Crop[s]
 in 17 miles we came to new Hartford, a
 smart Town, with containing a number of good hou-
 -ses, among which, was a large place of Wor-
 -ship, then to the River of Fort Schuylar
 4 Miles, where we passed through another
 Town as large as Hartford, and the build-
 -ings good. here we crossed the River,
 which I thought was not much larger than 
 Brandywine, we then went down the
 North side of said River through a Rich Coun-
 -try thick settled to Bratons 3 miles where we
 took up our quarters, where we got good ac-
 -comodations both for ourselves and horses.
 Farmers busy Mowing and making hay today, the first
 we have seen, Grass so stout, scarcely room
 on the ground to dry it 24 miles Seventh day last about 4 Oclock in the
 afternoon while we were at Stockbridge a
 Violent hail storm passed through the coun-
 -try a little to the North of us, its direction was
 nearly East and its extenton 20 or more
 miles, and from one to two in breadth,
 as we returned to Oneida next Morning
 We beheld its destructive effects, on the
 corn, Oates, &c; and this day for more
 than five miles, it was affecting to see
 the destruction it made: whole fields
 of wheat were entirely cut off, so that
 we could not see one head standing, corn,
 Flax, and Oates fared but little better, Peas
 in the Gardens and fields, Acres being
 Sown here, were entirely cut off, destroy
 -ed, large fields of Timothy were so bro- 
 broken down that they smelled like
 fresh hay, there being many Pokebushes
 along the Road, they which were knocked all
 to pices, the stalks which were as thick
 as rake handles were broke, in short
 all vegetation where the storm reched
 suffered much; the fences, stumps, &
 Old logs were much marked: the Win-
 -dows of a number of houses were very
 much destroyed, one place of Worshi[p]
 we understood had more than 300
 lights broke. 28th. A fine Morning, and a pleasant day
 for traveling: about 8 or 9 miles of a fine
 Country down the River, the poorly farmed
 buildings not near so good as further back,
 thence 5 miles to Adridges where we got
 our Breakfasts, through land equally
 as good, and much better farmed, with
 some large buildings; both spring and
 Winter Wheat good, also the Corn; and fine
 meadows loaded with the best of Grass; the
 River at times close on our right, which
 flowed along with a gentle Current, appeard
 pretty deep, tho not much wider than Bar[n] 
 dywine, this was through what is called the
 German flatts. We passed through the County
 Town of Hackamack, and so over the River
 on a Bridge to the southside one mile be-
 -fore we fed. thence 14 miles to Teevendurfs
 over high, dry, Stony Land, Buildings mostly
 poor, as was allso the grass and other Crops;
 we now left the River at some distance to our left.
 About three miles back we went by a
 pretty elegant House, now occupied by
 the prespeterians , it was built by William
 Johnson before the French and Indian War
 as a place of Worship for the Indians. In about one Mile from after we left Teevendurff’s
 having passed through a fine flat, we rode
 the River which had increased much in
 weadth Width, the flat still Continuing,
 in one mile we left it, and passed over 6 or
 7 miles of a Stony, rough, poor Country,
 except some bottoms on the River, the build-
 -ings also poor, then 7 or more miles, fine
 bottoms loaded with grass, and various
 sorts of grain; thicksettled near the River
 with many good Buildings, more particu-
 -larly on the south side. the latter part 
 >part of this stage the Mountains, or high roc[ky]
 Hills crouded near to the River, so that
 inplaces there was scarcely room for a
 Road. Lodged at Connolly’s 17m 41 miles Peas are very commonly swon in this
 Northern Country, from Canada to this place
 3, 4 or more Acres in a lot; they are used to
 feed Horses, fatten swine, &c, the Bottoms
 on the Mohocks, contain a large quantity
 of them. --- Spring Crops of all sorts on
 this River and for a many miles further Wes[t]
 I have observed to be very much hurt with
 a Yellow Blossomed Weed, it has the appear-
 -ance of Mustard tho much smaller, it grows
 so thick in places, that the Oates, Peas, spring
 Wheat &c: are entirely hid. 29th. A pleasant ride 2 or more Miles down
 a rich bottom all under Culture. the scar-
 -city of Railtimber has induced many far-
 -mers on this River to hang gates at certain
 places instead of fencing each side of the
 road, so that Corn, Wheat, Peas &c comes close
 up to the road side, which causes a delight-
 -ful appearance where Croops are good. fro[m]
 thence to Degraph’s 17½ miles this stage; the 
 Land mostly stony, some of it very rough,
 and but little bottom land on the river, the
 Buildings mean, and Farming poor. ---- I have often admired since we came on
 this River to see such large heaps of Ashes
 remaining untucked, where there has
 been for Years past Pot-Ash Manufacture
 carried on, they convey to the traveler,
 that the people have no Idea, the land
 would be benefitted by spreding them over
 it, or otherwise, that they are to lazy to do it.
 A few miles back some Men were hoeing
 very poor Corn in a field, where I had no
 doubt there were 3; or 400 Loads of Ashes
 in a heap untuched, I called aloud to
 to them to know why they did not
 spread the heap of Ashes over the field
 and so have good corn, and not be hoe-
 -ing such poor stuff as that was; they stod like
 Men amazed, made no reply, and we passed
 on, -- And a few miles further on we saw
 a large pottash Works close on the River
 so that when the Ashes were thrown out of the
 Tubs they went into the River Water, and were drive[n]
 of with freshes 
 thence to Shenectady 13½ miles, the
 land thin and stony, with but little
 bottom land on the River. We had the
 water often in view, and tho we have
 seen but few streams of Consequence
 that which o run into the River since we left
 Fort Scuylar, yet it has increased very
 much in Width. Where we lodged last
 night, our Landlord said it was but
 60 Yards Wide, in many places since
 I supposed it to be from 100 to 150, and
 at Schenectady where we ferryed it, we
 were informed it was 60 pearches wide. The town made a pretty appear-
 -ance from the Opposite Shore; it is si-
 -tuated close on the south side of the
 River, appeared to be a considera-
 -ble place, with many good buildings
 we did not stop in the town it, desireing to
 >go where we could get grass for our horses
 >& understanding there were plenty of
 Taverns on towards Albany, we pro-
 -ceeded forwardward, but we found the
 country was to poor to to produce good 
 grass, for it was a perfect sand bed, ex-
 -cept some swamps, nearly all the way to
 Albany, and thinly timbered with Pitch
 Pine, and as thinly Inhabitted, being
 but 10 or 12 houses for 15 miles. and each of them a Tavern When Evening
 came we were hard put to for good Quar-
 -ters, within 1½ miles of Albany we found at the Wi-
 -dow Scotts, pretty good pasture, but
 the House and things in it looked very
 discouraging, however we fared found it a
 place of better quarters than we expected.
 This has been a trying days ride, the Road
 were was very dusty, and the Wind with us, so
 that we were much smothered. 45 miles 30 In 1½ Miles we arrived at Albany, the
 Town stands on the West Side of the North
 River, under a hill, so that we had but
 little prospect of it until we we came close by,
 we did not stop in the Town, riding
 in at the West side, and out at the
 South end; Shortly after we left the
 City we passed by two beautiful country
 seats on Commanding Eminances to our 
 Right, the fruit trees around them, the de-
 -scending green meadows before their doors
 and the River which was in full view, rend-
 -red them desirable their situation very en-
 -chanting. We now pursued our Coarse down
 the River having it at times in view, to
 Quemanstown 15 miles, where we got a
 good Breakfast, a few miles on this side Al-
 -bany, the land was a Stony Gravel, with
 a hard Clay; then sandy; the Whole of
 the way poor; thinly settled; and buildings
 mean; mostly a pitchpine Timber, --- Thence to Catskill 18 miles; the first
 3 or 4 rough and stony; then 8 or 10 miles
 through an Old Settled Country; pretty
 level fields; without pasture, meadows very light, Wheat,
 Rye, Cheat, and some Cackle, mixed toga-
 -ther made their Winter Crop; the land
 a stiff Clay, in dry Weather it bakes very
 hard; the Remainder of this stage full of
 Limestone ridges, and so stony as not to be
 arable Arable Catskill a large stream with a
 very Rocky bottom; from thence to Pear-
 -sons a Dutch Tavern where we lodged 12½
 miles. In about two miles we crossed the
 Katters-kill on a high Bridge, Just below
 which there was a remarkable fall of 
 30 or more feet over a huge pile of Rocks,
 which damed the Water for miles back, &
 formed a very fine Millseat, on which were
 erected a Merchant, and Sawmill; from thence
 to this place the Land continued very much
 broken with high Limestone Ridges runing
 in a Southern direction. Much highland
 were to be seen in this days ride; we often
 had a full view of many miles extent o-
 -ver the North River; and on our right
 at 10 or miles distant, ran a chain of
 high Mountains. The latter part of this
 stage the Land better than farther bac[k]
 with pretty good buildings, some good
 fields of wheat, mostly bearded. 47 miles 1st 7 mo 1 and 1st of the week, We would have been glad
 to have reached a friends meeting today, but
 found it impractable, therefore thought best
 of traveling, tho not without some unplea-
 -sant feelings, being in a Presbeterian Coun-
 -try. ---- Early this morning we passed
 through two considerable red Cedar groves,
 on Rocky, poor Land; then through pret-
 -ty good land, and thick settled, tho very much 
 broken with limestone Ridges, in 10
 miles we Crossed Esopus Creek a
 Smart stream larger than Brandywine
 fine bottoms up the Creek to the Town
 which is a smart Village containing
 a number of good buildings. we pass-
 -ed through the skirts of the Town, &
 in about 4 miles, of stony, Rough,
 Land we got to greenskill, here we
 we got our took Breakfast at DeWitts , in
 a Rocky country. He has a Merchant
 Mill near by, on the most natural dam
 and fall I think I ever saw. There
 is a ridge of Rocks runs across the kill
 on each side of Which is high firm land.
 one end of the Mill head which conveys the
 water on the Wheels, rests on these Rocks,
 from which to the opposite Shore is but ten
 feet; the Miller told me that by putting
 an eighteen Inch board, on the top
 of about 18 Inches already raised, on
 the ridge of Rocks, he could pen wa-
 -ter enough, if it met with no supply, 
 to keep the Mill a going for three days, there
 being such a large, swampy, low piece of
 ground above this natural dam. Thence
 through a Rough Country, the good roads,
 in about 18 miles we arrived at Samuel Baldwin [‘s]
 in 4 or more miles of the first part of this
 stage we Crossed the Rosendell, a lively
 stream, nearly as large as Esopus, the
 Bridge over it was near fifty Yards long
 and twenty feet from the Water, yet the
 stream rose so high a few months ago as
 to lie on the bridge, -- In perhaps four
 Miles further we came to the Wallkill,
 which was as large as three of the Rosen-
 -dall, and into which the Rosendall runs
 a few Miles below. We went several miles
 up the Wallkill through a fine, level Coun-
 -try, and Crossed it in a boat; it was perhaps
 60 or 70 Yards wide, and 10 feet deep. There
 appeared to be no Current in the River, occa-
 -tioned by a Ridge of Rocks that runs across it
 it 5 or 6 miles below, over which the Water
 falls 20 or more feet. From what I have seen
 as well as heard, falls of this kind are very 
 common on most of the Water in this part
 of the Country. --- As we advanced South-
 -ward, the Land improved in quality, and
 the Wonderful Ridges of Rocks, that were
 so very common further back, grew fewer,
 yet stones rather Increased; tho most of the
 land in the latter part of this stage is
 Arable, more especially after the Stones
 are drawn of, which in divers places
 have been done and put up in stone fen-
 -ces. The Plaister of Paris has been latter
 -ly introduced into these parts and answers
 very well. We arrived at Samuel Bald-
 -wins about four Oclock, weary, and glad
 glad we were got to a friends house. The
 weather latterly has been very warm, and we
 having travelled hard from Oneida, both
 us and our horses wanted Rest, we conclud-
 -ed to lay by here a day or two, in order to get
 them Shod, and to help these backs which were
 a little sore. -- John Pierce, having at times
 >for some weeks past, hinted to me, that he had
 some wish before we returned home, to go
 over the North River to see the school at
 the Nine partners, but since we left Onei-
 -da, our draft homewards was such, that we 
 put it by. But on our arrival here, un-
 -derstanding we are were within 28 miles of it sd.
 School, and Samuel Baldwin kindly offer-
 -ing to let us have fresh horses to go there
 and to take good care of our own until
 we returned: upon weighing the propos-
 -al we felt easy in attempting to go. 36 miles 2nd. Accordingly this morning we went 9 miles
 nearly on an East direction to Edward Hal-
 -locks near the North River, over a very rough
 Stony country; about one Mile before we
 got to Edwards , off some high land, we had
 a very beautifull and extensive Prospect
 for about 20 miles over the North River, &
 as far each way, up and down the Water. The
 face of the country appearing to descend to-
 -wards the River, and being mostly improv-
 -ed, the Wheat and Pasture fields, together
 with large houses, Barns &c and some sheets
 of the River which presented in places, also
 the Town of Pocepsey, which was four miles
 up the River on its Opposite Shore: made
 the Landscape truly delightful. We dined
 at Edward Hallocks , but the day prov-
 -ing very Warm, and our horses young, not
 suitable for traveling such weather, we thought 
 it would be best not to proceed further,
 therefore in the Evening returned to
 Samuels . 18 miles 3rd. Got our horses Shod this Morning, and
 intended to have set of homewards in
 the Afternoon, but there coming up a hea-
 -vy Gust of Rain and Hail, we put it by of un
 until next Morning. 4th. Set of early this Morning through
 a pretty good Country, and fine Roads
 to Jacksons, 18 miles, here we fed our hor-
 -ses and got a second breakfast. We pass-
 -ed by four large places of Worship this
 Morning; and a number of good houses
 and Barns, the land level and pretty
 clear of stones. A Chain of Mountains
 were steadily in view on our right, at ten
 or miles distant; and we left newburgh,
 and New Windsor 8 or 10 miles to our left.
 More Swamp Meadow for the last 14 miles
 than for 100 before. A large proportion
 of the land was sown with wheat, which
 was mostly light. Not so much Rye as
 further back. Thence throug good land,
 thick settled, and a beautiful country to
 Goshen, the County Town of Orange County. Off a commanding eminence, a few miles
 before we got to this Village, we had an
 extensive Prospect, to the West, to the
 South, and to the East, I expect the Eye
 reached 20 miles each way, over a level
 looking Country, much improved. In
 the neighbourhood of this Village, lies a large
 proportion of valuable Meadows, and
 shortly after we left the Town I observed all
 the fences, both Pot, and Rail, and Worm
 fences, were made of nice Ceder Rails,
 and upon enquiry I was informed, in what
 is called the drowned Lands, there is a
 Ceder Swamp of Several thousand Acres,
 which supplys the country for several miles
 round. A very valuable source. In 6 miles
 over land more rough and hilly we got
 to Florida a place of several good buildings
 where we fed. Water for our horses to drink
 at has been very scarce these two last stages. Thence 12 miles to Doctor Cooes, where
 we Lodged, over a hilly, Stony Country,
 a great abundance of Limestone the 
 latter part of this stage. Rye the most
 common Winter grain. We are now
 in the Jerseys 3 or 4 miles South of the
 New York line, having travelled in sd
 York State upwards of 500 miles 5th. This has been the worst stage for our
 horses that we have met with since we
 left Oneida, and not very good for our
 -selves. Went to Doctor Beeches 7 miles
 to Breakfast. very good. Our last
 7 miles was through a rough Country,
 a Considerable Mountain close on our
 left, and a Valley on our right; most
 of the Land very stony. Stone fences
 pretty frequent. The farmers have
 been very busy for this Week past, in
 ploughing and hoeing their Corn, and
 in ploughing for buckwheat; a large
 Quantity of this Grain, being sown here away in
 this Country. A few Crops of good Wheat
 are to be seen, but light crops of rye
 are more commonly frequend. A Dutch
 Plough with one handle which stands near-
 -ly upright, with a very short beam an[d] 
 pan Share, is almost the only plough such, that
 is used for 200 miles back; they appear to
 work easy both for the horses, and plough
 -man, and does their business pretty neat. Shortly after we left this stage we Cross-
 -ed the Wallkill, fifty miles higher up than
 where we crossed it firtday last, yet the
 Stream was so large, as to have a forge erect-
 -ed on it a little above the fording place.
 In about 7 miles further we Crossed the
 Pawlinskill, which was the first Water

 to Newtown or Sussex Courthouse a smart
 Village, thence to Jacob Lundys , through
 a pretty good Country tho very much bro-

 little wheat sown, and that mostly very light.
