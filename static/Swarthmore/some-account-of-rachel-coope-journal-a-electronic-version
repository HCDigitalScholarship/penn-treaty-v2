 Tunesassah 6 mo My dear Parents, About two weeks
 ago I wrote to you and sent it by an Indi-
an that was going to Pittsburgh for
the things they Committee has sent
for us, in which I promised to give a
more full account of our Journey by
Jm. Embree when he returned, and
I feel myself so indebted to Father, as
renders it requesite for me to com-
ply with his request, but on looking
over the notes which I have kept,
seeing how unperfectly they are, it has al-
most discouraged my attempting, for
I cannot concieve they will be any way
entertaing, excepting a little bare infor-
mation, I often feel myself very defecti[ve]
in literary knowledge, and my Ideas
in matters of Consequence, much con-
tained, let those whose genius are
more bright, have Charity, and ac-
cept, dear Father, my communication
flowing from the Sincerity of the heart
 Mind has felt very much wear
the Worlds applause, knowing
 that it is not human literature, or
the acquirements of Man, we are
to be enriched with, but with the
 blessings of the Poor in Spirit. I frequent-
ly look towards my native home, with
longing desires to hear from you, not
having heard a Word from Chester County
Since we left there. My dear B. has not
been very well since we came here, tho
mostly keeps about, Jacob Taylor often
charges him to take care of himself
until he becomes accustomed to the
Climate and Water, Cousin and my-
self have been bravely. -- The young
Men had moved into their new House
about two weeks before we came, which
when finished will be a very comfortable
one, and a pleasant situation, those
lately cleared, that it looks fough about
here yet, and the Garden &c will not be
 very productive this season, They have
two Men hired, one a Carpenter finish-
ing the Mill, the other diging or mond
 are kept very busy at
home so far, together with housewo
and sewing for the young Men, indeed 
 was time for them to have some females
among them, their Situation was trying
let those who are favored with all
convenienceies, and necessaries of Life
calmly reflect on the many advantages
they enjoy, and the Obligations they are
under to their gracious benefactors. I
Salute you all in near affection, hoping
to hear from you before long, and I wish
to be affectionately remembred to all en
quiring fnds. & relations, not forgetting
GrandMother, in which my husband
and Cousin joins. I mentioned it was
thought letters would come this summer
on the state Road, but that communicat
 will be entirely Stoped in the Winter
Season, Jesse or Abner Barker at Pitts-
burgh will take care to forward letters
to us. I hope thou wilt not expose my
notes, tho have no Objection to some
of my near relations seeing them, if
I get time, I propose makeing out a
short draught for Brother Ezra, as
I intend writing to him. I had intended
to have written to my Brothers and
Sisters, but could not to all except com-
prized in one letter, therefore must post-
pone it at present, and perhaps may
send an answer when they Write to me.
 6 mo 30 when I wrote to the foregoing I
 expected J Thomas, and Wm Embree 
 would have set off sometime last week
but Jonathan was desirous to see the
Indian return from Pittsburgh, and
it is probable he may come to day
or tomorrow, but Wm being uneasy
being uneasy I expect they will set
of early tomorrow Morning whether
the Indian returns or not, and I hope
when he comes, I shall not be disap-
pointed of hearing from Chester Coun-
ty, we are enjoying a pretty good state
of Health in near Affection, I remain
 Your Daugher Rachel Coope Tenusassa 6th m 23rd 1804Estemed Parents About two weeks ago I wrote and sent by an Indi
an that was going to Pittsburg for the things that the com-
mittee sent for us, in which I promis'd to give a more full
account of our journey by Wm Embree , and I felt myself so in
-debted to father as rendered it requisite for me to comply with
his request, but looking over, and seeing how imperfectly it
was, almost discouraged me attempting, for I cannot con
-cieve it will be any way entertaining excepting a lit
-tle bare information. I often feel myself very defective
in literary knowledge and my Ideas in matters of conse
quence much confined, let those whose genius are more
brightened have charity, and accept dear father my com
munications flowing from the sincerity of the heart, my 
mind has felt very much wean'd from the worlds applause
 knowing it is not human literature or the invention of
man we are to be enriched with but the blessings of the poor
in spirit. - I frequently look toward my native home with
longing desires to hear from you, having not heard a word
from chester C since we left there, my dear B has not
been very well since we came here tho mostly keeps
 about J Taylor often charges him to take care of himself
till he becomes a little accostumed to the climate and
 water, I have been bravely, cousin also. They had moved
into their new house about two weeks before we came which
will be a very comfortable one when it is finished and
a pleasant situation tho so lately clear'd that the gardens
 &c will not be very productive this season. they have
two men hired one a carpenter finishing the mill wright and another digging in
or mending. The that we are kept very busy at home
so far, together with housework and sewing for the young men
indeed it was time for them to have females among
them, their situation was trying, let those who are favourd
 >with all the necessaries of life calmly reflect on the advantages
 they possess, and the necessity of rendering thanks to their
gracious benefactor. I salute you all in near affection
hoping to hear from you before long, and wish to be rem
embered to all enquiring friends and relations, not
forgeting dear Grandmother, in which my husband and
 cousin joins. I mention'd it was that letter would come
 this summer on the state road that communication will
be entirely stoped in the winter Jesse or Abner Barker at
Pittsburg will take care to forward letters to us I hope thou
wilt not expose
my history have no objection to some of my near relations
seeing it, if I get time shall draw a short draught for B
Ezra as I intend writing to him, I had some thoughts of
writing to my own brothers and sisters but could not write
to all excepting compris'd in one, therefore must post
pone it at the present and perhaps will send an answer
when they write to me. 6th mo 30th When I wrote the foregoing I
expected J Thomas and Wm E would have set off sometime
last week but Jn. was desirous waiting till the Indian returnd
 from Pittsburg it's probable he may get here today or to
morrow but Wm being uneasy I believe they will set off
early tomorrow whether he comes or no I hope I shall not be
 disappointed when he the Indian comes of hearing from C. County
we are enjoying a reasonable state of health I am in near affection.
your dutiful daughter R Coope In the fall of the year 1804 my dear
husband and I inform'd friends of brad-
ford mo. meeting of a concern that had attend
ed our minds to go and reside some time
with the Indian natives near the Alleghany
River, to endeavour to instruct them in
 agriculture, spinning, dairies, &c; & Obtaining
the unity and sympathy of our friends
at home, also the concurrence of the yearly
 meeting's committee on Indian affairs, H.
Jackson likewise having a minute from
Newgarden mo meeting to accompany us 5th mo 20th
 1805 2nd day. After a time of comfortable
quiet, wherein we were in some degree favour
ed to feel the overshadowing of divine regard
to be near a considerable number of our
near relations and friends being present, we
took leave of them in feeling embraces of
endearing love, Father Coope and Brother
Ezra bearing in company to M. Embree's
there bid farewell to dear James and Wife
and parted with father, a close trial, tears
 flowed in abundance under a feeling sym'
pathy for him, and ardent desires were
raised in my heart that he might par
-ticipate of that peace which is the preci
ous enjoyment of all the sincere heart
ed, now in his lonesome and advanced
 stage of life, Brother continuing with us
to Wm. Truman's 11m, where we lodged.
my dear husband and B took their repose
in the waggon, Cousin and I more comfort
 ably accommodated with a good bed, I soon
soon fell asleep, near 3 Oclock awakinged
the recollection of the parting season
 presented and no focibly revived that tears
flowed from my eyes, & sleep departed. --
Thou O my God has at seasons been
pleased in thy unmerited goodness to
make bare thy arm, and in times of trial
afford sweet consolation, as patience
 was abode in, under a humble sense
Thereof may I a little intercede for a
 renewed continuation of thy love. 21st. 3rd day . A fine morning, after a
smart shower, taking tooking breakfast parted
with our brother, and set of ab. 6, went
11m to the rising sun tavern, fed our horses
& took some refreshment in the waggon,
then pursuing on travelled 8m & stoped
at Wm Brinton door him nor
wife not at home, we were willing
to go on. but the daughter and gran
 grandmother insisted on our our going in,
 & an excellent dish of coffee was soon
prepared, which was grateful to the pa-
 late, then proceeding on, got to our
Brother, G John 4m about 4 oclock, and
 lodged here Wm Embree met us agree

some necessaries for our journey, set
off brother going a piece to put us in the
right road, 3m from L crossed little con
 nostoga, proceeded along being entire
strangers. the roads exceedingly badly &
cut in ugly holes, and very muddy,
the country beautiful, fine grain and
clover, crossed big chaques creek, a large
stream 9m from L. got some refresh-
ment for our selves and horses at
Christian Shellers Inn keeper 1/4 past 2
proceeded on our journey and pursuing
 to Elizabethtown where we arrived a while
 before sunset 9m, Lodged at the blackbear
tavern, the road continuing bad the land
good tho more hilly than nearner L., My atten
-tion has been so employed in viewing the
 roads and country that I have scarcely
had any time for serious reflection, tho
have not felt much anxious unpleasant
sensations, nor enjoyed a large portion
of that precious consolation that is so
desirable. O that I may abide in the pa
-tience with an eye riagle to him whose
fatherly protection is as a wall around
those who are sincerely devoted to serve
him wherever their lot may be cast 23rd
5th day. A fine morn. rose early, set
 out about 4, crossed connowaga moun-
tains and creek, the hills exceedingly
rocky, the roads rather better near Mid
-dletown, some of the land good, forded
over sweet arrow Creek a very large
water, it ran into the bed of the waggon
>it was of a considerable wealth, got to Middle-
town in dauphin County to breakfast
8m, met with Richard Tunes send a few
lines home. 9 oclock proceeded on our
journey Thus a beautiful valley and
very fertile soil for several m, came
in sight of the river about 11 oclock, the
prospect of the country on the right
hand was soon after obstructed by a
large ridge of limestone mountains
some places the Rocks were 30 or 40 feet high from the
surface of the ground and continued
till we came near on the bank of the
river. got in sight of Harrisburgabout
1 oclock. 9m, stoped under the shade of a tree

refreshment in the waggon. 1/2 past 2 on
proceeded on, crossed a small creek calld
paxton over an elegant stone bridge,
then pass'd thru Harrisburg a very consi
derable Town, & beautiful situation having
a fine prospect of the river, travelled
7m close on the bank thereof, a distance
of fine cultivated land on the right hand
the river on the left, a great many
Locust trees in full bloom on each side
together with the prospect of the water
made it delightful, but after a calm comes
a storm, crossed a large stream called fish
ing creek and for 3m it is astonishing, to be
hold just one path along the bank of the river and
great rocks hanging from 400 to 600 feet
high almost over our heads the roads exceed
ingly stony but not dangerous, we crossed stony
creek & put in at David Elder's tavern 10m
here we were just at the foot of cattatinna
or blue mountain, came round it, by
the side of Susquehanna it is computed by some
to be 600 feet high, I could scarce keep my
eyes off it, it looked the prospect was so wonderful 24th
6th day Set out this morn 20m past
4, had a very good road a little up hill and
down with some spots of cultivated land
for about 2m, then cross'd Clarks creek and pre
 pared to ascend peters' mountain, the
 road good, we were one hour and quarter going
over it about a mile up, remarkable to see
several lively springs so near the top, after
 we left this mountain we cross'd a large stream
of water call>ed powells Creek, and had an ex
-cellent road to Hallifax a small town 10m,
some parts cultivated, the grain chiefly rye
some fields of a changeable red, with some clover
the soil rather gravelly, and of a reddish co-
lour. got breakfast at John Ewigs Tavern,
here we came on the river again, proceeded
from H. about 9 & crossed armstrong Creek,
it begining to with some rain we pass'd along a very
rough road close on the river at the foot of
Berry's mountain, cross'd wishinisky
 creek considerably larger than Brandywine
now we began to get among come upon the pines, a few
 places here and there cultivated, the soil not
very productive, poor looking houses, stoped
by the road side to regale ourselves and horses
10m, set out again at 2, had a good Road 3m to
Magantango mountains, 1/2 an hour going
over, cross'd Magantango creek over a high
frame bridge, a large stream. The road
turning so much east seemed to surprise
us, but found it was to go thro a gap between
in several places between great mountains,
indeed for many miles there is very
little but mountains, got to a dutch
man's a while before sunset 10m, and
lodged. but every thing looked so dirty
I knew not what to do. however we
prepared of our own ourselves a supper, and went to
 bed, but the greatest mortification of all
was,the landlady sent two men who were
travellers to the other bed in our room,
 our men as usual in the waggon, we
were very quiet, & rose before day 25th
4th day Set off at 4 had a very rough
 road between mountains 4m, came to the
 reading road at Hioustons tavern, where we
 wished to have gotten last night, cross'd GreenBoror revals
& pass'd along thro the woods, except a
small cultivated spot where we saw some
fine wheat growing for a rarity, came
on the bank of Mahaney & went up.
 The ride of it a considerable distance
between wonderful mountains, cross'd
over it, being a very large stream, pro
ceeded and came to the Mahanoy moun
tain 52m going over. rather different from the others, we
 ascended all so far with leaving the ridge
on the left hand, & when on the top made
a short turn and went down with the
ridge on same ride, but this we travelled
 a considerable distance on the top a
fence on one side and went down in
 the form of an X it was amazing to
see the steepness on the north side
 stoped 11m and fed our horses made some
chocolate for breakfast, proceeded on 1/2 past 9

bank of the west branch of Susquehanna,
the land good, as also the road, got to
 Milton about 6 a small town 12m put up
 at John Brady's tavern, I being very un-
 well took a little medicine, soaked my
feet and went to bed before sunset with
out supper. cousin being very kind in
waiting on me, they call'd for their sup
per. it being a time of frolicing a great
many men were there drinking and
fighting most of the night, that we
could not take our usual rest, indeed
it did so impress my mind with sorrow
that I could not refrain from weeping 26th
1st day Set out at 4 travelled seve
ral m on the bank of the river, good
road, cool morn. considerable white
frost, stoped at David Shannon 8m got a very
good breakfast and grain for the horses,
as soon as I went into the house I dis
cover'd somthing ailed the landlord, he
he made such heavy moans, and query'd
 what was the matter, he said he had got about
building, and thought so much, that he had got
low in his mind. I told him he had a fine barn
a good looking place and materials ready
for building his house, and had no cause
to be discouraged, he said he had been a hard
working industrious man and had been help helped thro
many difficulties by the hand of providen
ce but all was nothing to him now, we told
him that hand that had helped would yet, if
we did but trust. he said he had strived all he
 could but could not help it. if he was as he
once was and saw one of us so, he would have
thought we might help it, but we knew not
till we were tried. he seemed very sensible
of his situation and possess'd of tender feelings Indeed I felt a near sympathy for him
and it revived a stronger impression on my Mind of our
own weakness than I almost ever felt before
unless aided by a power superior to our own.
half past 8 proceeded, passed thro a small
village, crossed muncey C., & got to Wm Ellis's 
 half past 12. 10m they were gone to meeting
it seemed pleasant to get amongst friends
having scarcely now the sight of one since we
left Lancaster. This afternoon wrote home, in
the evening the family was collected Mrs
 Ellis just read several chapters in the testamen
 wherein a comfortable time of silence was
witnessed to prevail. 27th
2nd day This morning washed some clothes

a good road chiefly thro the woods, crossd
Loyalsock C. a very large water, got to
 Williamsport the capital of Lycoming C.
7h 12m put up at James Winter (Wm
 Ellis being there on business) where we were
comfortably accommodated, 28th
3rd day Started this morn a little after
4 went about 1m 1/2 stoped at a house to buy
grain for the horses, hearing that we could
not get any further on. while the men
 were employ'd cousin and I stoped in
 to a little house by the road side where we met
with some who formerly lived in C. County
Baileys by name, who invited us to eat
breakfast we accepting of their kindness,
 proceeded on, cross'd Lycoming C.very large
 pass'd thro a small village, called newberry. then
 ascended the hill, and went thro a moun
tainous wilderness country very mountainous 5m to one Brooke,
 fed the horses, the men took their breakfast
of a cup of milk and some rye bread, half
past 9. set out again, a very rough road,
6m to the foot of the Alleghany Mountain,
fed the horses, and had a rock for a table, some
of the waggon store together with excellent water
that issued from toward the top of the m servd
served to refresh the weary travellers, but mo peace
for them nor the horses because of the little knats.
 half past 1 pursuing on, the road being excessive
stony computed to be 6m 1/2 over, 3 hour 3/4 going,
put up at Kookens just at the foot, where
were some of the tallest hemlocks pines, &c that
I ever saw. 29th
4th day Set out this morn 1/4 past 4 af-
 ter passing a hill, had a very rough swampy
road along a valley between great mountains
Thro wash a thicket of amazeing tall trees of
different kinds, it being cloudy seemed at
most dark. cousin and I preparing our
selves with staffs set out on foot, while we
were traveling pursuing along before the waggon we heard
a & noise, & looking round to see what was the
matter, beheld, as the waggon was going down
a very steep & excessive muddy place a Feather the bed
pitched out before, and was conveyed under
the waggon in the mud, and a bottle of milk,
 which we had purchased for breakfast, & was
 pushed in the blanket that tied it, got out
without any damage. however we took of
the blanket, got a sheet and tied it up
again, & proceeding along crossed a lively
stream of water which followed the
 the road backward and forward for several
m after crossing it a great many times, and
coming to it again I percievedg a tree
across a little down, which appeared about
two yards high from the water & attempting it
for a bridge. when near the middle it swagging my
 foot slipping, in I went not much over
shoe tops and was forced to wade thro. altho we had not travelled a great
 distance this morn. but it was difficult
 geting along and my feet being wet, con
 cluded to make a fire and get breakfast
and feed the horses, we then proceeded, continuing
thro the wilderness, we came to pine C. cross'd
 it 13. times in about 5 or 6m got to Morris's
Mills about 12 oclock 12 1/2m from where we
lodged, we met with Francis Kings daughter when was at Wm Ellis 
and she told us we could not get thro the wil
derness with the waggon, and also the man
that lives here said the name which seemed
discourageing, got dinner, set off half past
2, cousin and I travelling on foot having a moun
tain to ascend got a great distance. before
the waggon, we stoped at one Jackson's till
the men come who were the people seemed glad
to see us tho no acquaintance, the woman said she
was pleased to see us so chearful, but her
husband, said it would take us six weeks
 to get there with the waggon, but told
us to call at Moses Wilson's and get his Sons
to assist, we proceeded along & crossd pine C at
the second fork, stoped a few minutes to see
Sampson Babs . got to James Yarnall's 6m,
I suppose a relation, his father's name was
 Daniel, from toward Midn, a while before
sunset and lodged- 30th
5th day Set out at 5 oclock purposing
 to breakfast at Moses Wilson , being informd
 it was 5m and the first house, but beheld, when
we came to it the house was empty, and nobody
to enquire of, however we being a great way
before the waggon, and cold, made bold to
open the door and go in, where we found
fire, put it up together and sat half an
hour warming ourselves till the waggon
came; after conferring together a while conclud
-ed to go on at a venture, as we having expected to
get some information of the road at M Wilson , but
by a draught of the road which our kind
friend T Stewardson had given us, knew we
left the state road, shortly after pursuing 1/2
 m came to a fork, takeing the left hand
road went on a piece (looking every way
for a house) thro the woods, over being excessive
swampy we came to another fork, then stoped
being quite at a loss; after going along
on foot both roads a considerable distance found
M Wilsons, but it was out of the way to
go to his house and a very bad road; thought thot
best to go 1m further on to James Idings 
to breakfast it being near the road, M and
his wife coming over there, I thought it strange to see
 such good looking friends settled in the
wilderness, and no remote from meeting
and surprising to see M Idings in such
a little cabbin, however we spent an the
time hour or two very agreeably, excepting the
bad accounts of the roads M Wilson telling
we might with difficulty get the waggon
10 or 15m further and one of his Sons
might go with us to the next house whi
which was 80m, 11 o clock we set off, cousin
and I going before giving warning of
the bad places, M Wilson Jr and Ben
-jamin holding the hindpart of the
waggon, the banks so steep and sidling
that one would think it impossible to
get along without oversetting; cossing
 as crossing we crossed an the pine another another large branch of the pine
C, & after travelling a piece got stoped
 by the trees that were across the
road, our 3 men with the assistance of
 two more got the axes to work it being
about 1/4m to Boatmans which took near two
hours to get the waggon up where we must
leave it, we endeavoured to persuade
some of them to go with us and help to open the
road, but there being but two families and no neig
 neighbours near, & they very busy planting
corn and out of provision, no mill with
in 20m, the woman said she could let
us have plenty of milk and butter but
had nothing else excepting a little fresh
venison which was being a very good relish with out
coffee; having just got our dinner, we then set to unload
-ing our waggon and packing having two mens
saddles along welaped one bed up in the wag
gon cover and tied on one horse sewed
up a sheet for a sack filled it and a 
bag we had along with clothing a load for

trying seasons, O may I ever abide in the

Taylor having been very unwell several
days, tho' better this morning and we
desirous of having him with us, all
set off at 9 o clock, taking a little provi

Indians were collecting, we took some
refreshment under a shed in the town

where were a large number of Indians
10 chiefs, and a good many women; old

the counsil with expressing thanks
to the great spirit in bringing us safe
thro our long journey, also that so ma

 to what should be communicated to

 to hear what we had to say, Henry O
Bail Cornplanter's son being our
interpreter. - The address from the com
mittee on our behalfs was read, part of
an epistle from Halliday Jacksons to
the Indian women, likewise a speech
from the young men residing here
 concerning temporary affairs saving
grinding &c, they were also inform'd
notwithstanding our journey had been
long and trying we felt peace of
mind in being with them and hoped
our sisters the Indian women would
be willing to be instructed; after we
became a little acquainted, then tel-
ling them we had no more to say at
 present. After a considerable time
of conferrence between themselves
the following is part of the substance
of a speech delivered by one of the
Chiefs Brothers Deweista (meaning Quakers) We return thanks to the great
spirit to see you all well, and that
the great spirit has preserved your
women on so long a journey, and
that they arrived safe in our country
we are all glad to see them, and are
 pleased much pleased to find they are go-
-ing to stay amongst us to instruct
our women. we return thanks to
the great spirit that he has put
this into their minds, we wish you
therefore to make your minds
easy; they also seemed pleased at
Hallidays epistle, signifying they
were at a loss for an answer, for
as two of the heads of their women
were not there. After sitting near
3 hours in counsil (exceedingly
warm and close) we were dismissed
they continuing their conferrence on
 2 hours longer on the business the young Men laid before them
those temporary affairs. broke up in
2 hours after, and appeard much
pleased with their proposals of our
young men, which were as follows Brothers Attend -

sah in order to make it more easy for

winter Brothers you know we began to
grind for you about the time you
were making sugar. we will continue

taking toll which will make one
year. And if any of you want
boards we will sell them to you
for four shillings per hundred but
we dont intend to trust any,
because we want to keep the chain of
friendship bright. And if you
 want any of your own logs saw

in order that our memories may
be kept bright I felt satisfaction in being there
Jacob Taylor says he has felt
more peace in attending some
of their counsils than any
 quarterly meeting; but it will
take us some time to get a little
 acquainted with their language. About 30 of the Indians has since join
ed together and opened the road which
will be an advantage to us as well

Indians, it being done completely Cornplanter did not attend
the counsil but has been here since
I did not deliver thy message for

him understand which was thee.
there was a paragraft in the addres

for the good spirit forgives
 as when we are do wrong if we are horror for it I know not but whether it had not

days after they calld a counsil, sent
for Cornplanter and made up
all the uneasiness, and restord

has since
 been here and he said he told them when
