<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

<p> Brothers. </p>
<p>We have considered what you said to us yesterday and<lb></lb> shall answer
                            you in a few words. We are thankful to the the<lb></lb> great Spirit that he
                            has preserved us in health to see each<lb></lb> others faces at this council
                            fire; we and our Brethren at home<lb></lb> have the same good will towards
                            you as our forefathers had<lb></lb> and are desirous to afford you any
                            service in our power, &amp;<lb></lb> that you may cherish peace with one
                            another and with all<lb></lb> men believing this will greatly contribute to
                            your happiness<lb></lb> we sympathize with you in your sufferings &amp;
                            distress, &amp; wish<lb></lb> strict Justice to be done you respecting your
                            Lands, you<lb></lb> have been informed we can take no part in war, which
                            is<lb></lb> one great reason why we cannot be active in civil
                            Govern-<lb></lb>ment and therefore are not capable of Judging all of
                            your<lb></lb> grievences, especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties
                            of<lb></lb> late years have not fully come to our knowledge; you have<lb></lb>
                            spoken to us respecting the piece of Land between <a href="/places/cayug1">Caynga<placename key="cayug1"></placename></a> &amp;<lb></lb>
<a href="/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creeks<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, as we are

                            satisfactory answer on that<lb></lb> subject. if it appears to be a matter
                            of great importance to you<lb></lb> it would be proper to lay it before him;

                            Congress<lb></lb> has sold it to Pennsylvania &amp; we do not suppose the
                            Commisioner's<lb></lb> has power to relinquish it; it is true that the
                            President and his<lb></lb> Counsellors have impowered a Commissioner to
                            treat with you<lb></lb> but we thing the Government had no design to compel
                            you,<lb></lb> you have Men amongst you of Good Understanding &amp;<lb></lb>
                            sufficient penetration to discover what you Just rights<lb></lb> are &amp;
                            if you minds are not easy with the proposals<lb></lb> that have been made,
                            we make no doubt but the Ears<lb></lb> of the president &amp; the great
                            Counsil of the united states<lb></lb> will be open to hear you &amp; to them
                            we conceive you have<lb></lb> a right to appeal. We desire wisdom may
                            conduce<lb></lb> your Councils that whatever is done may tend to
                            promote<lb></lb> harmony &amp; peace. </p>

<p> Brothers, We have considered what you said to us yesterday &amp; shall
                            answer you<lb></lb> in a few words; We are thankful to the great Spirit that
                            he has preserved us in<lb></lb> health to see each others faces at this
                            Council fire; we &amp; our Brethren at home have<lb></lb> the same good will
                            towards you as our forefathers had, &amp; are desirous to afford you
                            any<lb></lb> service in our power, &amp; that you may cherish peace with one
                            another &amp; with all<lb></lb> Men, believing this will greatly contribute
                            to your happiness; we sympathize<lb></lb> with you in your sufferings &amp;
                            distress, &amp; wish strict justice to be done you respect<lb></lb>ing your
                            Lands, you have been informed we can take no part in war, which is
                            one<lb></lb> great reason why we cannot be active in civil Government &amp;
                            therefore are not capable<lb></lb> of judging of all your grievances,
                            especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties of<lb></lb> late years
                            have not fully come to our knowledge; you have spoken to us respecting
                            the<lb></lb> piece of Land between <a href="/places/cayuc">Caynga<placename key="cayuc"></placename></a>
                            &amp; <a href="/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creeks<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, as we are
                            unacquainted with the<lb></lb> Commissioner's power we can give you no
                            satisfactory answer on that subject, <unclear>[which?]</unclear><lb></lb>
                            appears to be a matter of importance to you, it would be proper to lay
                            it before him; the<lb></lb> Land you mention along <a href="/places/lakee">Lake Erie<placename key="lakee"></placename></a> you have been already acquainted that
                            Congress<lb></lb> has sold it to <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, &amp; we do not suppose the Commissioner
                            has power to<lb></lb> relinquish it; It is true the President &amp; his
                            Counsellors have impowered a Commis<lb></lb>sioner to treat with you, but we
                            think the Government has no design to compel<lb></lb> you, you have Men
                            amongst you of good Understanding &amp; sufficient penetration<lb></lb> to
                            discover what your just rights are, &amp; if your minds are not easy
                            with the proposals that<lb></lb> have been made, we make no doubt but the
                            Ear of the President &amp; the great Council<lb></lb> of the United States
                            will be open to hear you, &amp; to them we conceive you have a
                            right<lb></lb> to appeal; we desire Wisdom may conduct your Councils that
                            whatever is done may<lb></lb> tend to promote harmony &amp; peace. We then
                            returned the Strings of Wampum.</p>

<p> We hope you will abide by the agreement which you have signed &amp; be

                            as a Society we have had experience of the benifits arising from these

                            good, you have seen the writ<lb></lb>ings by which we are bound, you say you

                            concerning you, on account of your not putting your names<lb></lb> to it.
