<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<p> Longevity, often living to the age of<lb></lb> about 90 and as they suppose 100
                    years<lb></lb> or upward, but as they keep no written Re<lb></lb>cords of Births or
                    other occurrences, nor have<lb></lb> any regular mode of computing time, other<lb></lb>
                    than by moons or Winters, or then remem<lb></lb>brance of remarkable Events the
                    most<lb></lb> of them can give no correct account<lb></lb> how old they are. While we
                    were rais<lb></lb>ing <a href="/people/jsilv1">Silver Heel<persname key="jsilv1"></persname></a>'s house a smart
                    old<lb></lb> woman, who was sitting on the Ground<lb></lb> looking on, we were told
                    could call<lb></lb> her Descendants round her to the 6th<lb></lb> Generation. Some of
                    them are subject to the Rheuma<lb></lb>tism which is supposed may be a
                    consequence<lb></lb> of their traversing the Wood in all weather,<lb></lb> night and day
                    - wading in the river and Suffering<lb></lb> their Cloathing to dry on them- and
                    often ly<lb></lb>ing out exposed with little or no shelter to<lb></lb> wet and cold- but
                    from the observation I<lb></lb> have made on the Inhabitants, where we have<lb></lb>
                    stopd coming along, the Rheumatism is a<lb></lb> complaint prevailing in this
                    climate<lb></lb> and therefore not wholly to be imputed<lb></lb> to the Indian
                    Exposures. </p>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_005" n="5"></pb>
<p>The Children are generally born in the<lb></lb> woods - where the Woman accompanied
                    by<lb></lb> her Mother or some other Elderly woman re<lb></lb>tires on the occasion
                    &amp; of cold builds a<lb></lb> Fire - The Babe is immediately wrapd in<lb></lb> a
                    Blanket &amp; in 3 or 4 hours the Mo<lb></lb>ther returns with it to her own
                    habitation.<lb></lb> she washes her blanket soon after in Cold<lb></lb> water &amp;
                    something, on the same Day, with<lb></lb> out injury to herself &amp; in two or 3

                    Loads, of Wood on her<lb></lb> Back with the Infant on the Top of<lb></lb> it tied to a
                    Board. the Boards for this purpose<lb></lb> are about two feet &amp; a half in
                    length &amp; one<lb></lb> in breadth with a little Hoop in front to<lb></lb> protect the
                    Head of the Child or to sus<lb></lb>pend a curtain to cover it from flies or<lb></lb>
                    cold. at the bottom a little foot board and<lb></lb> at the sides are loop holes for
                    the purpose<lb></lb> of fastening the Child which is placed in<lb></lb> an erect porting
                    with its hand down<lb></lb> its sides &amp; then swathed with a piece of<lb></lb> Cloth
                    from the feet to the Chin so light<lb></lb> as to be unable to disengage itself- if
                    the<lb></lb> Weather is Cold &amp; the Child young a Wild<lb></lb> Cat Skin or some
                    other skin with<lb></lb> soft Fur is put next to it. &amp; if <lb></lb>

                    natural direction<lb></lb> one consequence of this is that the<lb></lb> track of the
                    different sexes may be<lb></lb> easily distinguished &amp; the children in<lb></lb> this
                    situation are carried about at pleasure &amp; if taken into the wood<lb></lb> are
                    laid down, or set up, against stumps<lb></lb> on Trees as occasion requires while
                    the<lb></lb> mother is employed in gathering wood<lb></lb> or any other service- a few
                    times in<lb></lb> the day they loosen there but the<lb></lb> children are so habited to
                    it that-<lb></lb> they become quiet when uneasy out<lb></lb> by being placed in again
                    this is<lb></lb> continued till they are about 9<lb></lb> months old &amp; anyway the

                    each<lb></lb> House in the Town. These Dancing Com<lb></lb>panies are preceeded by two
                    Men, ap<lb></lb>pointed for the purpose, who are dressd <lb></lb>in the most frightful
                    manner they can <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_010" n="10"></pb> devise, being coverd with Bear Skins &amp;<lb></lb> a bag of Ashes tied
                    about their middles<lb></lb> behind them &amp; a hole to admit the Ashes<lb></lb> to run
                    about as they move- their faces<lb></lb> are coverd by a Large Painted mask
                    hav<lb></lb>ing a high mane on the crown made of the<lb></lb> coarsest long Horse Hair
                    standing al<lb></lb>most erect &amp; large Eyes encircled<lb></lb> with a flame coloured
                    ring- the mouth<lb></lb> is open &amp; shewn their own Teeth with<lb></lb> which They
                    Grin in a terrific man<lb></lb>ner &amp; their Hands are blackd so<lb></lb> as to leave
                    the mark with every<lb></lb> Person they lay them on- In their<lb></lb> Hands they carry
                    the Shell of a mud<lb></lb> Tortoise which has been dried for<lb></lb> the purpose with
                    a stick thrust<lb></lb> thro' it which extends the neck<lb></lb> &amp; large Head to its
                    full extent<lb></lb> and inside of the Shell are a quan<lb></lb>tity of Pebbles- Which
                    when shaken<lb></lb> make a Dismal rattle- these men<lb></lb> going from House to House
                    rub this<lb></lb> Rattle on the sides &amp; up &amp; down the <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_011" n="11"></pb> Door Ports- they also frequently enter<lb></lb> into the House but say
                    nothing nor<lb></lb> do any Injury- as they travel about<lb></lb> if they meet with any
                    Person male<lb></lb> or female in their way they pursue<lb></lb> them- those who turn
                    about &amp; receive<lb></lb> them in a friendly way they shake<lb></lb> hands with, yet
                    say nothing- but<lb></lb> it is rather expected that many<lb></lb> should run as if
                    terrified- these<lb></lb> before getting into a House<lb></lb> are pursued &amp; if
                    overtaken are laid<lb></lb> hold of &amp; blackd with their Hands<lb></lb> but no other
                    injury is offerd and<lb></lb> except a frightful yelling noise any things spoken-
                    The design<lb></lb> of these frightful representations<lb></lb> is to Personify and
                    imitate the Bad Spirit &amp; to<lb></lb> remind the Indians of the Necessity<lb></lb> to
                    amend their Ways &amp; avoid wrong<lb></lb> things- After these Ceremonies are
                    <lb></lb>performed they Collect at the Coun<lb></lb>cil House where they away &amp;<lb></lb>
                    paint a Dog (a White one is preferd)<lb></lb> the Poor Dog is then killd &amp;
                    thrown on <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_012" n="12"></pb> on a Fire prepard for the purpose.<lb></lb> the Indians, mean while
                    Dancing round<lb></lb> the Fire and Hooping with a Great noise.<lb></lb> The Dog is
                    Esteemed by them as approaching<lb></lb> the nearest to themselves of any other
                    Ani<lb></lb>mal and therefore is devoted on these occasions as a<lb></lb> sacrifice to
                    the Great Spirit, and together<lb></lb> with their Dancing is under a
                    profession<lb></lb> of pleasing Him- during this ceremony they<lb></lb> are feasting
                    occasionally on Corn Vegetables &amp; Venison-<lb></lb> this Venison is taken by
                    encircling a large<lb></lb> space of Hunting Ground &amp; <lb></lb>all the Deer <gap></gap>
<lb></lb> here Killd are Devoted to this Feast.<lb></lb><gap></gap> about a Pound of Tobacco,
                    of<lb></lb> a particular Kind which they consider as peculiarly agree<lb></lb>able to
                    the Great Spirit is also thrown on the<lb></lb> Fire while the Dog is burning, in
                    the smoke<lb></lb> whereof the Spirit of the Dog ascending is<lb></lb> believed to be
                    received by the Great Spirit<lb></lb> as a Sacrifice of a Good Savour- during
                    this<lb></lb> Ascention one of their Chiefs whom they call <lb></lb>their Minister
                    addresses the Great Spirit<lb></lb> in a Speech, the purport of which is an<lb></lb>
                    Acknowledgement for favours received-<lb></lb> Thanks for His Preservation in times
                    past<lb></lb> and imploring His continued care &amp; <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_013" n="13"></pb> protection- he then addresses the People<lb></lb> advising how they
                    ought to Conduct them<lb></lb>selves &amp; pointing our some of the promi<lb></lb>nent
                    Evils which they should avoid- one<lb></lb> of the greatest of these is stealing and
                    ano<lb></lb>ther is for the Husband to Desert &amp; Sepa<lb></lb>rate himself from his
                    Wife during Preg<lb></lb>nancy- but taking the Life of another<lb></lb> is not considerd
                    a Crime so Capital, as they<lb></lb> are left at liberty to revenge it by
                    ta<lb></lb>king the Life of the Murderer- this may<lb></lb> be done with impunity by the
                    Nearest<lb></lb> Relative of the Deceased &amp; they then convey the cries of Blood
                    to be done away. The before<lb></lb> described feasting &amp; Dancing is
                    continued<lb></lb> at Intervals &amp; by Companies for <del>the</del> a<lb></lb> Period
                    of from five to ten Days- &amp;<lb></lb> Formerly toward the latter part of<lb></lb> the
                    Time many of them became in<lb></lb>toxicated, but at present among the<lb></lb> Indians
                    of this Neighbourhood this is<lb></lb> entirely disused- and altho the feast<lb></lb> is
                    conducted with considerable noise<lb></lb> &amp; apparent Confusion, it also is
                    atten<lb></lb>ded at Intervals with much Solemnity &amp; on the<lb></lb> part of many of

<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_014" n="14"></pb> a religious ground &amp; from sincere &amp; good<lb></lb> motives-
                    Formerly they<lb></lb> had Image of a man which at the<lb></lb> Time of those hearts was
                    decorated in<lb></lb> the Indian Stile with Wampum &amp;<lb></lb> Trinkets &amp;c- this
                    was elevated on a<lb></lb> Pedestal of about 6 feet in heighth &amp;<lb></lb> their
                    Dance &amp; feasting were performd<lb></lb> round it &amp; their addresses made
                    to<lb></lb> it- being considered by them a Repre<lb></lb>sentative of the Great Spirit-
                    about<lb></lb> the Year 1802 this Image fell<lb></lb> down &amp; a council was held what
                    was<lb></lb> to be done- some were for erecting<lb></lb> another- others for discarding
                    such<lb></lb> a Representation entirely- <a href="/people/habee1">Henry

                    leave off Drinking Rum<lb></lb> &amp; refrain from Selling their Lands- a<lb></lb>
                    Reformation accordingly took place, but<lb></lb> it may be remarked that before
                    this,<lb></lb> friends had been labouring with them<lb></lb> much in those respects-
                        <a href="/people/conud1">Conudiu<persname key="conud1"></persname></a> Con<lb></lb>tinued an advocate herein

<p>In Time of War they formerly Roasted<lb></lb> &amp; Eat their Captives- there are one
                    or two<lb></lb> among them here who have partaken of<lb></lb> this inhuman feasting, but
                    of latter time<lb></lb> this Custom is exploded by this Nation<lb></lb> The Masks
                    (before described) are some<lb></lb> times worn as a cure for Diseases which<lb></lb>
                    cures in this way, are supposed to be<lb></lb> effected by operating on the
                    Imagination.<lb></lb> War is considered in its Origin<lb></lb> to proceed from the Evil
                    Spirit- that<lb></lb> is the first agressor is instigated by<lb></lb> him- but when
                    agression has taken<lb></lb> place they consider is not only justi<lb></lb>fiable to
                    Revenge the Injury but even<lb></lb> believe that by so doing they are<lb></lb> employd
                    in the service of the Good<lb></lb> Spirit &amp; that if they are killd in<lb></lb>

                    beside their Public Devotions<lb></lb> at Hearts &amp; Sacrifices, a Kind of
                    Family<lb></lb> Worship which is when they are setting<lb></lb> together particularly in
                    the Evening, if<lb></lb> one of the Heads of the family feels an<lb></lb> Impulse to
                    address the Great Spirit<lb></lb> he or she yield to it with an audible voice,<lb></lb>
                    and this, among the more serious Class,<lb></lb> is frequently performed, tho' not
                    many<lb></lb> stated Days or Times-- They are some<lb></lb>times exercisd in this Way
                    when their<lb></lb> Friends are with them &amp; the subject<lb></lb> of Aspiration is a
                    Thanksgiving for<lb></lb> preservation of their particular Family<lb></lb> or Tribe
                    &amp; for supplying the varied<lb></lb> necessaries &amp; Comforts of Sides-
                    de<lb></lb>siring their Continuance-</p>
<p> If an Indian of any particular Tribe<lb></lb> dreams a remarkable Dream
                    respecting<lb></lb> a Deceased Relative being Hungry or<lb></lb> in Need of Sympathy or
                    assistance in<lb></lb> any way the Indians of his Tribe are<lb></lb> informed of it
                    &amp; a Hunting takes place<lb></lb> in consequence- the Game then taken <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_019" n="19"></pb> is prepared and cooked and a feast and dance<lb></lb> in a religious
                    way is instituted by the<lb></lb> partees engaged which continues for a<lb></lb> day or
                    more.</p>
<p> Formerly when a stranger or distant friend<lb></lb> entered an indian habitation it
                    was common<lb></lb> to set before them such provision as they<lb></lb> had cooked in the
                    house which the guest<lb></lb> partook of without ceremony except that<lb></lb> of
                    thanks, but friends<lb></lb> have rather advised them not<lb></lb> to give their
                    provision indiscriminately to<lb></lb> wondering or idle persons <lb></lb>
<del>but only to</del>
<lb></lb><del>strangers pariicularly Friends they have</del>
<lb></lb><del>old or infirm</del> least it should encourage<lb></lb> indolence and be a
                    sound of oppressi<lb></lb>on on to the industirious and frugal- in this<lb></lb> respect
                    therefore thine is some change -<lb></lb> when a <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> Indian leaves his friend<lb></lb> he tells him he is done,
                    which amounts<lb></lb> to farewell - but if any circumstance<lb></lb> takes place which
                    has given umbrage<lb></lb> he withdraws and says nothing -this is<lb></lb> clear
                    evidence that he is offended-</p>
<p>Notwithstanding stealing in considered<lb></lb> a great crime, it not unfrequently
                    takes<lb></lb> place -when the person committing a<lb></lb> theft is discovered
                    complaint is made to the<lb></lb> chiefs who dispatch a runner command<lb></lb>ing
                        <lb></lb><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_020" n="20"></pb> him to appear before the council-<lb></lb> this mandate he
                    immediately obeys The<lb></lb> charge is then opend to him &amp; if he is
                    guilty<lb></lb> confession is made and the Property taken is<lb></lb> restored if in
                    being -- every Chief or Warri<lb></lb>or in Council is then at full liberty to<lb></lb>
                    express what they think, one by one, all<lb></lb> which he is obliged to hear. Thus
                    is considered<lb></lb> a severe punishment, but no other is<lb></lb> inflicted. Should
                    the Person charged de<lb></lb>ny that he is Guilty, he is considered In<lb></lb>nocent,
                    for it is remarkable in them that<lb></lb> they confess when justly Charges.
                        <a href="/people/jthom2">Jonathan<persname key="jthom2"></persname></a> told me that on such
                    occasions, he <lb></lb>had frequently been a Witness, their<lb></lb> countenance &amp;
                    Eyes betrayd them imme<lb></lb>diately, &amp; of itself has been suffici<lb></lb>ent
                    evidence to him that the Gospel<lb></lb> has been preachd in them, or in other<lb></lb>
                    Words that the Witness for Truth is<lb></lb> placed in their Minds--</p>
<p>The Different Sexes are very jealous &amp; shy of<lb></lb> each other so that it is
                    rare to see a man<lb></lb> &amp; Woman, even of the same Tribe, con<lb></lb>versing
                    together without witnesses, &amp; when<lb></lb> a Woman has occasion to go abroad it
                    is<lb></lb> accounted Honourable to take one or more<lb></lb> Children with her to
                    testify, if needful, <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_021" n="21"></pb> that she has been orderly - there are<lb></lb> too many proofs that
                    this is only a preten<lb></lb>ded shyness, yet being santioned &amp;
                    esta<lb></lb>blished by custom it is productive of se<lb></lb>rious Evils - The Indians
                    appear to be as<lb></lb> well calculated and to possess talents for so<lb></lb>cial and
                    rational enjoyment as<lb></lb> any people, but custom putting a nega<lb></lb>tive on an
                    open friendly acquaintance<lb></lb> of the sexes, the natural tendency whereof<lb></lb>
                    would be the improvement of their mind<lb></lb> and a knowledge of the good
                    qualities one<lb></lb> of the other, with the undesigned pro<lb></lb>duction in many
                    instances of permanent<lb></lb> attachments -they enter into Marie-<lb></lb> age very
                    early before their judgment<lb></lb> in ripe for the choice, without affec<lb></lb>tion
                    &amp; without a knowledge of each<lb></lb> others dispositions - the
                    consequence<lb></lb> of which is that separations often<lb></lb> take place, so that
                    there are many<lb></lb> instances now here of Men who have<lb></lb> turned off several
                    wives, and of women<lb></lb> who have discarded as many hus<lb></lb>bands - there on
                    both sides marry<lb></lb>again (in a clandeitine ways to others <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_022" n="22"></pb> and in some Instances change back<lb></lb> again, and thus, what ought
                    to be esteem<lb></lb>ed the most Devious &amp; important Connec<lb></lb>tion in Life, is
                    lightly formed &amp; dissolved<lb></lb> and shifted about in a manner unknown<lb></lb>
                    among a People rightly Civilized -- In these<lb></lb> separations the Mother takes
                    the Children &amp; uses them Kindly<lb></lb> They are very fond of Children &amp;
                    indulge them<lb></lb> in most of their Wishes using little restraint<lb></lb> or
                    Conection of any Kind, yet sometimes<lb></lb> if Obstinate, tho' very young, they
                    will<lb></lb> plunge them in the River &amp; if one Dip is<lb></lb> not sufficient it is
                    repeated till they be<lb></lb>come very quiet, which they soon do.<lb></lb> as the
                    Children get a little older they<lb></lb> will sometimes talk to them a long
                    time<lb></lb> in a Kind of harrangue or Speech<lb></lb> setting forth what the Child
                    should<lb></lb> do &amp; what leave undone-- this at<lb></lb> times has such an Effect
                    that the<lb></lb> Tears will trickle down their Cheeks<lb></lb> of the Child before the
                    speech is<lb></lb> ended-- at other times they ridi<lb></lb>cule them for doing wrong
                    and tell<lb></lb> them they are not wise in doing so.<lb></lb> to tell an Indian that he
                    is not wise is a grating stigma.</p>
<p>When a Person has been Sick for a con<lb></lb>siderable Time in a lingering condition
                    &amp; <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_023" n="23"></pb> the appreciation of Roots &amp; Herbs or other<lb></lb> Medecine proves

                    Public Worship, they repair to the Ha<lb></lb>bitation, which they go round rattling

                    alarm them, yet has considerable af<lb></lb>fect on the Debilitated Indian
                    whose<lb></lb> fears being thus previously awakened by<lb></lb> knowing what is to be

                    some<lb></lb> times they pull the sick Person, whe<lb></lb>ther Male or female, about

                    Per<lb></lb>spiration, working on the Imagin<lb></lb>ation &amp; rousing the Indisposed
                    Person<lb></lb> to a Salutary Exertion--- Their Idea is<lb></lb> they drive away the
                    Evil Spirits in this way. --<lb></lb> The Ancient Custom when an Indian died<lb></lb>
                    who was the Head of a Family was to take out<lb></lb> his Goods &amp; burn the Hut,
                    the Design of thus<lb></lb> destroying the Habitation was to prevent<lb></lb> any
                    differences which might arise among<lb></lb> his Descendents or survivors respecting
                    the<lb></lb> possesing it that so Peace might be pre<lb></lb>served--<lb></lb>

<p>When an Indian of distinction &amp; property<lb></lb> dies his Gun, Blanket, Knife,
                    Trinkets &amp; other<lb></lb> This I believe is not correct, but I cannot rectify
                    it. Property are preserved about 12 &amp; some<lb></lb> times 18 months, before a
                    Division is made--<lb></lb> this Delay is in Consequence of an Opinion which
                        <lb></lb><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_025" n="25"></pb>they entertain that it is not decent or<lb></lb> respectful to
                        <del>take possession or</del> bring<lb></lb> them into use sooner-- they are
                    then bro.<lb></lb> into Council &amp; held up to public view, the<lb></lb> Indians
                    present being informed that here<lb></lb> are the Goods of such a Deceased
                    Chief.<lb></lb> on the Articles being thus severally held<lb></lb> up Any of the Young
                    Men who in<lb></lb>clince, are at liberty to advance &amp; Snatch<lb></lb> them away,
                    till the whole are thus dis<lb></lb>tributed. the Relatives of the Deceased<lb></lb>
                    making no claim in consequence of Con<lb></lb>nection. This Custom still
                    prevails<lb></lb> among some of the Indians in the Southern States<lb></lb> but some of
                    the more thoughtful among<lb></lb> the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senceas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>,
                    since their building of good<lb></lb> Houses &amp; increase of Property, do not<lb></lb>
                    seem satisfied with the foregoing Cus<lb></lb>toms &amp; in two or three Instances
                    they<lb></lb> have made Wills to divide their<lb></lb> Possessions &amp; Improvements
                    among<lb></lb> their Children. this is a Natural Con<lb></lb>sequence of an advance
                    toward Civilization<lb></lb> &amp; must obtain more place among them.<lb></lb> The Gun
                    &amp; other things were formerly buried<lb></lb> with the Deceased, but latterly

<p>They believe in the Ressurection of the Spirit<lb></lb> but not of the Body &amp;
                    that for some Time<lb></lb> after Death it is common for it to Ascend &amp;
                    De<lb></lb>scend. in order therefore for its accommoda<lb></lb>tion, as altho perhaps
                    from motives of De<lb></lb>cency &amp; Respect, a Tomb is erected over<lb></lb> the
                    Graves, sometimes formd with logs<lb></lb> &amp; having a Roof of Bark -- at others
                    it<lb></lb> is Constructed with Boards &amp; the Roof of<lb></lb> the same- it made in

                    themselves comfortable Houses.<lb></lb> these Improvements if they incline to
                    leave<lb></lb> (as they sometimes do in order to settle else<lb></lb> where) are sold to

                    Men formerly pluckd out their<lb></lb> Beards as also the Hair from their Heads<lb></lb>
                    except a Tuft on the Crown which was<lb></lb> left to grow pretty long. In time of

                    Head &amp; Beard was found by twisting a<lb></lb> Wire of the Common Knitting Needle

                    two Inches in length. On the Wood<lb></lb> being withdrawn the Wire forms a

<p>they are very Jealous of encroachments on the<lb></lb> rights &amp; Priviledges of
                    each other &amp; Offences of this<lb></lb> Nature have often given occasion for War
                    between<lb></lb> Nations. When such Offences Occur they hold<lb></lb> private Councils
                    &amp; if they determine<lb></lb> to engage, they endeavour to do it by Surprize.
                    Such<lb></lb> as excel in Artifice &amp; courage are appointed their Chiefs
                    &amp;<lb></lb> have the management of their War Concerns.<lb></lb> They generally paint
                    themselves Red, but on<lb></lb> some occasions streaks of Black are intermixed.<lb></lb>
                    Painting with Red, tho' expressive of War, is also<lb></lb> used to denote
                    cheerfulness so &amp; sometimes to hide<lb></lb> the true expression of the
                    Countenance, &amp; in this<lb></lb> way, when rubbed round the Eye, it has a
                    Won<lb></lb>derful Effect. it also makes them look fierce --<lb></lb> Black mostly
                    denotes Trouble -- In their<lb></lb> Marches They are as Careful as possible to
                    con<lb></lb>ceal their Tracks &amp; to make very little Fire<lb></lb> in order to
                    prevent its being discovered that<lb></lb> a Multitude has passed. when engaged
                    they<lb></lb> are very Fierce, scalping those whom they kill,<lb></lb> &amp; taking
                    Prisoners all they can-- these are taken<lb></lb> home with them &amp; arranging
                    before the Council<lb></lb> where it is Determined which should be Put <lb></lb>to
                    torture &amp; which preserved alive, -- the lat<lb></lb>ter are sometimes adopted in
                    Families in the<lb></lb> place of Relatives who have been killd in<lb></lb> the War-- in
                    such Cases they are treated here<lb></lb> by &amp; often only in marriage with the
                    nation<lb></lb> receiving them. --<lb></lb> They are very fond of ornaments &amp;
                    a<lb></lb>mong the Woman particularly Silver<lb></lb> Brouches. TS told us that he once <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_030" n="30"></pb> saw 700 of these on one Garment.<lb></lb> When an Indian believes he
                    has received an<lb></lb> Injury he is never satisfied without Revenge<lb></lb> and if he
                    cannot obtain it on the aggressor he<lb></lb> seeks to do it on some of the same
                    tribe<lb></lb> or family - to illustrate this Disposition,<lb></lb> I may here relate an
                    Account<lb></lb> that was given me of an old Indian Man<lb></lb> on the <a href="/places/alleg">Allegany River<placename key="alleg"></placename></a> whom I saw<lb></lb> and shook hand with,
                    who passes<lb></lb> among them by the name of Stiff<lb></lb> Arms. In an Indian War
                    many<lb></lb> years since, when he was young<lb></lb> he was shot in an Engagement<lb></lb>
                    thro' both his arms - tho Ball<lb></lb> passing near the Elbows entirely<lb></lb>
                    disabled him for resistance he<lb></lb> thought it necessary to make his re<lb></lb>peat
                    - in this situation it seems like<lb></lb>ly he would have perished but some<lb></lb> of
                    his own Tribe found and took care<lb></lb> of him feeding him for a long time<lb></lb>
                    and dressing his Wound. Hostiliies<lb></lb> between the contending parties
                    being<lb></lb> by this time over, himself and his Tribe<lb></lb> returned home, the
                    thoughts of <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_031" n="31"></pb> the injury he had sustained Rankled<lb></lb> in his mind &amp; he
                    endeavored for a<lb></lb> considerable time to prevail with<lb></lb> some of his friends
                    to go with him<lb></lb> to there notion by when he was<lb></lb> wounded to make
                    celabration, but the<lb></lb> distance was so long (being I think<lb></lb> about three
                    thousand miles) and<lb></lb> the danger of the understanding so<lb></lb> great that they
                    would not join<lb></lb> him - <gap></gap> unwilling to relinquish<lb></lb> his design he set
                    out above &amp; trav<lb></lb>aild till he reachd the Border<lb></lb> of his Enemy - he
                    then stripd<lb></lb> himself naked &amp; for several days<lb></lb> &amp; night lay in
                    the wood &amp; corn<lb></lb> field in the vicinity of the Ene<lb></lb>mies Town,
                    watching to catch<lb></lb> some of them who might be se<lb></lb>parated from the next -
                    by obser<lb></lb>vation he at length found that<lb></lb> the warriors had gone away on
                    an<lb></lb> expedition of hunting or war &amp; on <lb></lb><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_032" n="32"></pb>entering the

                    immediately made his Retreat, tra<lb></lb>velling into the wilderness night<lb></lb>
                    &amp; day with the greatest expedition<lb></lb> he was capable of till almost
                    fam<lb></lb>ishd -after extreme hardships en<lb></lb>durd he at length reached home
                    &amp;<lb></lb> says he then left satisfied, - he<lb></lb> still relates the circumstance
                    with<lb></lb> great apparent satisfaction - says he<lb></lb> thinks he did right &amp;
                    that if he had<lb></lb> not obtaind revenge he never should<lb></lb> have felt easy-
                    However despa<lb></lb>rately cruel this act may appear to<lb></lb> the Christian, and in
                    a rational view<lb></lb> however unjust that the innocent<lb></lb> should be made to
                    suffer for the Guilty,<lb></lb> yet great allowance is to be made <lb></lb>for the
                    unfetterd Indian who by Edu<lb></lb>cation is taught to believe that the<lb></lb>
                    Revenge for an aggression is a Du<lb></lb>ty -that the family or the tribe, are<lb></lb>
                    implicated with the individual aggres<lb></lb>sor and that if he falls in

<p>I have now a short oppy to note that<lb></lb> I arrived here last sixth
                            day at the pressing re<lb></lb>quest of the <a href="/places/allegany">allegany<placename key="allegany"></placename></a> and <a href="/organizations/seneca">Cattarauguy<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> Chiefs, to at<lb></lb>tend a council of the
                                <a href="/organizations/sxntns">six nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>. I find the<lb></lb>
                            principle Business is to adopt some permanent<lb></lb> measure to prevent
                            any more Sales of their Lands <lb></lb>&amp;c. The War Department are mostly
                            in favour <lb></lb>of the Plan, &amp; I rather think it will be car
                            <lb></lb>ried into effect - they have received their <lb></lb>presents a few
                            Days since at this place <lb></lb>from the U.S. &amp; I think I never saw so
                            <lb></lb>many Indians together that conduct <lb></lb>ted with so much propriety
                            - the num <lb></lb>ber could not be well ascertained but it <lb></lb>was thought
                            there were about One Thou <lb></lb>sand, and I dont remember to see One
                            <lb></lb>Drunken Indian amongst them - </p>
<p>I believe Wool &amp; other Articles we shall <lb></lb>want can be obtained at
                            this place - The <lb></lb>Agents says he will furnish the Cattaragus
                            <lb></lb>Indians with Wheels, or Unite in any <lb></lb>Measure proper to forward
                            the Object of <lb></lb>Improvement - the Chief Warriors wife <lb></lb>has learnd
                            to spin tolerably well, and <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_035" n="35"></pb> intends to purchase a Wheel of her own<lb></lb> &amp; commence

<p>Cloudy &amp; some Rain. no account yet of<lb></lb> the Indians return and we have to
                    exercise Pati<lb></lb>ence. Ill therefore employ part of the Time in des<lb></lb>cribing

                    it was purchased about the year 1803.<lb></lb> for $1.25 cents p Acre and contains
                    692<lb></lb> Acres- about 60 of which is cleard and per<lb></lb>haps 22 of the 60 may be
                    Calld Meadow or<lb></lb> bottom Sand, lying on the <a href="/places/tunec">Tunassasa

                    <lb></lb>considerably Improved &amp; very good (say 12<lb></lb> Acres) the rest is
                    capable of being made so,<lb></lb> and will all bear culture with the Plow.<lb></lb> The
                    Cleard Upland produces well but is not<lb></lb> the most fertile- the residue mostly

                    Heads. The House is a very comfort<lb></lb>able one, suited with Judgement for
                    the<lb></lb> occasion. Its Inhabitants are a very<lb></lb> clever Company, each filling,

<p>After Breakfast set out to attend the Council<lb></lb> of <a href="/places/colds">Cold
                        Spring<placename key="colds"></placename></a> - I stopd in at several Houses on our<lb></lb> way to the
                    Town to Shake hands with the Indians<lb></lb> then went to the Council House with is
                    a Building<lb></lb> nearby the Centre of the Town about 40 feet in<lb></lb> length &amp;
                    20 in breadth. having a Door at each End <lb></lb><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_043" n="43"></pb> and two Holes in the
                    Peak of the Roof to admit the<lb></lb> ascending of the Smoke from Council Fires -
                    which<lb></lb> are built on the Ground about 12 feet from<lb></lb> each Door.- These
                    fires are daily used by the In<lb></lb>habitants for cooking on other purposes,
                    being<lb></lb> a kind of public Priveledge the Open Doors<lb></lb> admitting ready
                    Impress &amp; Egress to them at plea<lb></lb>sure- the floor is laid by nature and
                    on each<lb></lb> side from one End to the other is a platform laid co<lb></lb>verd with
                    Board, Skins &amp;c. about 6 feet in width<lb></lb> &amp; 10 Inches in heighth- over
                    these all the<lb></lb> heighth of 5 feet under other Platforms which<lb></lb> serve to
                    throw up skins Corn or any Lumbering<lb></lb> articles &amp; to the Rafters was
                    suspended a quantity<lb></lb> of old Corn some of it near the Openings in the<lb></lb>
                    Roof being as black as smoke Could make<lb></lb> it - this they dont mind but use it
                    for making<lb></lb> Bread &amp; other purposes perhaps preferring it<lb></lb> as I
                    observed in their Houses generally the Corn<lb></lb> was stored by suspending it
                    with the Husk<lb></lb> this way - as The Indians were not generally<lb></lb> collected
                    it afforded opportunity to make some<lb></lb> observations. <a href="/places/conud1">Conudius<placename key="conud1"></placename></a> House stand the nearest<lb></lb> to the Council House
                    &amp; within a few Yards- Our at<lb></lb>tention was here averted by the sound of
                    mu<lb></lb>sic &amp; Dancing &amp; feeling some inclination to be<lb></lb> witnesses we
                    were informed that it would give<lb></lb> no offence &amp; so went inside of the
                    Door - In the<lb></lb> Middle of the Room lay the Hommany Block<lb></lb> &amp; an Old
                    Bench apparently designd to prevent an<lb></lb> encroachment on that part of the
                    floor &amp; to<lb></lb> preserve regularity of Circuit sound them <lb></lb>those rude
                    Regulators were encompassd by<lb></lb> 18 <lb></lb>&amp; 20 Females (occasionally more)
                    some Elder <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_044" n="44"></pb> Elderly Women &amp; down to Girls about 10 years<lb></lb> of age- these
                    forming a Circle were Dancing (or<lb></lb> shuffling) round sideways with a slow
                    &amp; solemn<lb></lb> motion, &amp; Heads uniformly reclining to the<lb></lb> sound of
                    Musick performd by a Man in one<lb></lb> corner of the Room. this was done by
                    beating<lb></lb> slowly on a Drum made by a Dried Deer or<lb></lb> some other Kind of
                    Skin dressd a little in the<lb></lb> manner of Parchment &amp; tightly strechd
                    over<lb></lb> the Top of a Churn. or sometimes we were<lb></lb> told an Iron Pot- they
                    said he bent with<lb></lb> two sticks &amp; the sound of one of them put me<lb></lb> in
                    mind of tinkling symbols, being, either hol<lb></lb>low &amp; enclosing something of
                    the trikling kind<lb></lb> or else havg some small bells attachd to<lb></lb> it. but it
                    was so dark where he sat that I<lb></lb> could not see- this sound he
                    accompa<lb></lb>nied with a vocal Time or perhaps a song,<lb></lb> but if the latter his
                    articulation was very<lb></lb> indistinct - it however appeard to be in<lb></lb> stanza
                    at the end of which the female<lb></lb> circle would cease their Dancing &amp;
                    walk<lb></lb> round with a quicker motion &amp; some ap<lb></lb>pearance of Hilarity
                    till after a circle or<lb></lb> two, another Stanza began. this Dance &amp;
                    music<lb></lb> continued for abt 2 Hours after we were there<lb></lb> &amp; the Dancers
                    would step out occasionally drip<lb></lb>ping with Perspiration (apparently to cool
                    &amp; get<lb></lb>air) &amp; then return again- they were much in<lb></lb> then usual
                    Dress except the Children several<lb></lb> of whom lookd clean &amp; Dressed for the
                    occasion<lb></lb> one in white Cloth- another Green a third<lb></lb> Blue &amp;c.- and
                    there had each a bunch of <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v2_045" n="45"></pb> small Bells hung to the Knee &amp; made a noise<lb></lb> as they Danced
                    not much unlike the singing of Secrets- a few<lb></lb> of them were a little touchd
                    with Paint- when<lb></lb> the Dance was over they had a Feast being a<lb></lb> kind of
                    soup or <unclear>sand-compon</unclear> we were told of<lb></lb> new corn shelld from
                    the Cob- a little meat, su<lb></lb>gar &amp;c. &amp; was boild in the Council House

                    had pre<lb></lb>viously (we were told) contributed, refraind<lb></lb> with their small
                    kettles or Wooden Bowls to<lb></lb> receive their shares-. After waiting for
                    some<lb></lb> Time an Antient Indian blew a Trumpet to no<lb></lb>tify the Inhabitants
                    of Council &amp; they began to<lb></lb> assemble- They were dressd of ornamented
                    various<lb></lb>ly many were painted with red streaks about<lb></lb> the face Head &amp;
                    Eyes as fancy inclined- some<lb></lb> had Bandages of Indian Workmanship round<lb></lb>
                    their Heads &amp; tufts of Feathers of different co<lb></lb>lumns. Sometimes Furs.
                    The Hair of some<lb></lb> was shorn round the Crown &amp; left long round<lb></lb> the
                    Temples &amp; on the Top of the Head- others<lb></lb> had it left long in little
                    Tufts over the Head<lb></lb> &amp; those Tufts plaited - many had Breast<lb></lb> plates
