<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Settlements generally<lb></lb> abstain from the use of Spiritious
                    Li<lb></lb>quors so that it has become very rare<lb></lb> to see one of them
                    Intoxicated. Since which<lb></lb> they seldom quarrel or fight among<lb></lb> themselves
                    but live in Harmony toge<lb></lb>ther--this Disposition they endeavour<lb></lb> to
                    Cultivate among the Children &amp;<lb></lb> hence they rarely differ as is very<lb></lb>
                    common with Boys. Their Dress<lb></lb> is yet for the most part in the Indian<lb></lb>
                    Stile but an Immitation of the mode<lb></lb> of Dress used among the Whites is
                    in<lb></lb>creasing among them--they are natu<lb></lb>rally avaricious &amp; saving
                    &amp; not being so<lb></lb> liable to Imposition as when they drank<lb></lb> Spirits,
                    some of them are growing rich--<lb></lb> but other expend their earnings in
                    Trin<lb></lb>kets &amp; Finery--the desire for Trinkets<lb></lb> seems however abating.
                    Altho mostly<lb></lb> Ingenious quick of apprehension &amp; keen<lb></lb> in penetration
                    they are many of them very<lb></lb> Ignorant &amp; helpless, inclinable to Indolence
                    &amp;<lb></lb> cannot readily reconcile themselves to <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_043" n="43"></pb> Labour. this however is not the case<lb></lb> with all &amp; their
                    prejudices have some share<lb></lb> in continuing this disinclination to Labour<lb></lb>
                    among the Men--as it was formerly accounted<lb></lb> Disreputable &amp; degrading
                    for them to do what<lb></lb> was considered the Womens Business. The<lb></lb> Men Built
                    the House &amp; Hunted to procure<lb></lb> Meat &amp; Skins--the Women Hoed the
                    Ground<lb></lb> planted, tended &amp; gathered the Corn, then poun<lb></lb>ded &amp;
                    cookd it--cut the Wood &amp; brought it<lb></lb> home--carried home the Deer Elk
                    &amp;c which<lb></lb> their Husbands had killd in hunting--brought<lb></lb> him Water,
                    in short did the laborious bu<lb></lb>siness principally--these prejudices are<lb></lb>
                    wearing off since the settlement of Friends<lb></lb> among them--the men both Old

                    her- about this Period of the<lb></lb> Courtship the Young Man presents the<lb></lb>
                    Young Woman or her Father with a pre<lb></lb>sent of Broaches, Ear bobs or other

                    accounted for from their often fasting<lb></lb> a long time, sometimes several Days,
                    &amp; when<lb></lb> they get Venison it is often eaten alone <lb></lb>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_048" n="48"></pb> without Salt, Bread or Vegetables, till<lb></lb> they quite loathe it-
                    when they go on an<lb></lb> Expedition either for Hunting or War, they<lb></lb>
                    frequently take with their only a little par<lb></lb>ched corn pounded with some

                    they will sustain great hardships<lb></lb> for many Days. H told us that when<lb></lb>
                    he was once in this Country, several years<lb></lb> back, an Indian was going with
                    them<lb></lb> a Journey of Two Days (Perhaps for a Guide)<lb></lb> on enquiry they found
                    he had brought no<lb></lb> Provision &amp; asking why he came without,<lb></lb> he
                    replied- Hoh! I eat enough before<lb></lb> leaving home to last two Days- I am
                    no<lb></lb> Child- I am a Man ~ When at home<lb></lb> they are in the general moderate
                    in their<lb></lb> Eating-<lb></lb> The Indians generally meany Young-the<lb></lb> Male, not
                    unfrequently between fourteen<lb></lb> &amp; Eighteen and the Females from
                    twelve<lb></lb> to sixteen- it is also common for many of the<lb></lb> Children to die
                    before they are 4 years Old-<lb></lb> but of those who survive that age in a
                    gener<lb></lb>al way it is supposed they exceed us in <lb></lb>longevity </p>
