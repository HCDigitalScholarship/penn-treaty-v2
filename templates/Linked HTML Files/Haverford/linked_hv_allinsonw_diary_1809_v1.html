<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                    counter<br/> part. A white Trader about 5 Months<br/> back had brought a Load of
                    Goods up<br/> the River &amp; among the rest some Cyder &amp;<br/> Cyder Royal -
                    stopping at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/colds">Cold Spring<placename key="colds"></placename></a> he of<br/>ferd them

                    collecting in their Council House<br/> made a polic of it &amp; became
                    Intoxicated-<br/> this very much alarmd many of the Sober<br/> Indians who
                    threatned to starve his Casks <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_029" n="29"></pb> &amp; let out the Liqur &amp; if he did not go away.<br/> they

                    several<br/> Indians helping them- he had told<br/> them in the morng that at a

                    coming<br/> on he went to the House &amp; brought to the<br/> Barn a piece of
                    smoked Glass &amp; desired the<br/> Indians, who disbelieved to look thro' it-
                    he acknowledged he<br/> saw something which he could not under<br/>stand- when
                    it was about half on they<br/> lookd at it again &amp; then began to be
                    con<br/>vinced that it would be as Joel had represen<br/>ted- he then told them
                    they might see that<br/> while People knew more than Indians &amp;<br/> that
                    they could tell these thing for years<br/> before they happened- This Eclipse

                    be<br/>ing aloft in the Building- the air had the<br/> feeling &amp; dampness of

                    circumstance a little similar<br/> of an Indian Man since he has been with<br/>
                    them at the time of an Eclipse of the<br/> moon. the Indian would not believe
                    him<br/> till seaming obliged conviction, when wrap<br/>ping himself in his
                    Blanket &amp; lying down<br/> he said he was a Poor Indian &amp; that while <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_032" n="32"></pb> Folks knew every thing- As we were<br/> going to Bed <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">T Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a> told me that we<br/> must return about

                    my own mind- sometimes I concluded<br/> it must be a Dream, but it continued
                    so<br/> long &amp; seemd so like a reality that I began<br/> to question whether
                    I was in my right mind<br/> I at lenghth concluded it could not be real<br/> I
                    told Mother that altho mentally I was<br/> thus with them my Body was far<br/>
                    distant &amp; I must return - I was begin<br/>ning to relate my persuasion that

                    Jun<br/> who I also thought was there &amp; felt very<br/> near to me, when I
                    awoke with a sweet<br/> Impression that though widely separa<br/>ted in Body
                    from my Dear Friend we<br/> were near in the Bond of that Fellow<br/>ship which
                    Time nor distance cannot<br/> prevent- the affectionate Impressions un<br/>der
                    which I awoke I continued for some<br/> time to enjoy, &amp; now while writing

                    saw a number of Allega<br/>tors lying at the bottom of the River, two<br/> of

                    said they were<br/> too ugly to put into the Canoe- they were <br/>about 15

                    so<br/> good as usual &amp; more weedy owing to the<br/> Coldness &amp; Wetness
                    of the season- they use<br/> the Hoe principally in preparing for &amp;
                    tend<br/>ing their Crops. it is said they have im<br/>provd in Cleanliness in
                    their Habitations<br/> but they are still Dirty- as also in their<br/> Persons.

<p>The Indians of the Settlements generally<br/> abstain from the use of Spiritious
                    Li<br/>quors so that it has become very rare<br/> to see one of them
                    Intoxicated. Since which<br/> they seldom quarrel or fight among<br/> themselves
                    but live in Harmony toge<br/>ther--this Disposition they endeavour<br/> to
                    Cultivate among the Children &amp;<br/> hence they rarely differ as is very<br/>
                    common with Boys. Their Dress<br/> is yet for the most part in the Indian<br/>
                    Stile but an Immitation of the mode<br/> of Dress used among the Whites is
                    in<br/>creasing among them--they are natu<br/>rally avaricious &amp; saving
                    &amp; not being so<br/> liable to Imposition as when they drank<br/> Spirits,
                    some of them are growing rich--<br/> but other expend their earnings in
                    Trin<br/>kets &amp; Finery--the desire for Trinkets<br/> seems however abating.
                    Altho mostly<br/> Ingenious quick of apprehension &amp; keen<br/> in penetration
                    they are many of them very<br/> Ignorant &amp; helpless, inclinable to Indolence
                    &amp;<br/> cannot readily reconcile themselves to <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_043" n="43"></pb> Labour. this however is not the case<br/> with all &amp; their
                    prejudices have some share<br/> in continuing this disinclination to Labour<br/>
                    among the Men--as it was formerly accounted<br/> Disreputable &amp; degrading
                    for them to do what<br/> was considered the Womens Business. The<br/> Men Built
                    the House &amp; Hunted to procure<br/> Meat &amp; Skins--the Women Hoed the
                    Ground<br/> planted, tended &amp; gathered the Corn, then poun<br/>ded &amp;
                    cookd it--cut the Wood &amp; brought it<br/> home--carried home the Deer Elk
                    &amp;c which<br/> their Husbands had killd in hunting--brought<br/> him Water,
                    in short did the laborious bu<br/>siness principally--these prejudices are<br/>
                    wearing off since the settlement of Friends<br/> among them--the men both Old
                    &amp; young<br/> now turn out in the spring of the Year &amp;<br/> fall Timber
                    &amp; split Rails--make the Fen<br/>ces &amp; assist in preparing the Ground
                    for<br/> Planting. for this purpose the Plow is some<br/> times used but more
                    commonly the Hoe,<br/> some of the men assist also in tending<br/> the corn
                    throughout the season &amp; do not<br/> so much as formerly require the
                    Wo<br/>men to wait on them as perform every<br/> trivial service. I saw one of
                    their<br/> Boys hawling stone with a sled &amp; oxen <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_044" n="44"></pb> which he drove with Considerable judg<br/>ment &amp; appeard pleasd
                    with his per<br/>formance this he would have once been<br/> hooted at for &amp;
                    perhaps his Bow &amp; arrow<br/> taken from him- formerly if a man took<br/>
                    hold of a Hoe to use it the Women would set down<br/> his Gun by way of derision
                    &amp; put the<br/> Hoe in its place would laugh &amp; say<br/> such a Warrior is
                    turnd is turned Woman&amp;<br/> When a Young Man inclines to marry<br/> &amp;
                    makes Choice of a Young Woman, he<br/> acquaints his Mother or eldest Sister
                    of<br/> his Wish- one of them goes to the Mother<br/> or eldest Sister of the
                    Young Woman with<br/> his proposal of marriage &amp; they commu<br/>nicate it to
                    her- about this Period of the<br/> Courtship the Young Man presents the<br/>
                    Young Woman or her Father with a pre<br/>sent of Broaches, Ear bobs or other
                    Trinkets<br/> to the value of about 6 to 10 Dollars<br/> if his offer or
                    proposal of marriage is<br/> not accepted the present is returnd<br/> to him but
                    if after considering it for<br/> some Days, it is satisfactory to her,<br/> her
                    Mother or Sister accompany her <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_045" n="45"></pb> to the Young Mans House &amp; present<br/> her to him- the Mother
                    or Sister then<br/> withdraw &amp; she stays with her proposed<br/> Husband- As
                    the seasons for Planting<br/> hoeing gathering Corn, procuring Fire<br/> wood
                    &amp; other Business come on, the fe<br/>male connections of the Young
                    Woman<br/> assist her in the different opperations<br/> during the first year at
                    the End of<br/> which without any other Ceremony<br/> the Marriage is<br/>
                    considerd valid &amp; Honorable. they some<br/> times however take a shorter
                    way<br/> for it &amp; too commonly part again<br/> on small disagreements, both
                    parties<br/> afterward taking other companions<br/> there are now many among

                    get to his Cabin &amp; has killd a Deer it<br/> is not uncommon to strike up a
                    Fire<br/> &amp; making a Spit of a Sharp Stick roast<br/> a [Hasp?] of his Deer
                    which he be<br/>gins to eat as soon as one side is done<br/> &amp; so continues
                    eating as his Vension<br/> cooks sometimes till the whole Ham con<br/>sumed Joel
                    told me that some of<br/> the Indians when very hungry would<br/> eat a Ham of
                    Venison without<br/> Difficulty- this practice of Hunting still Continues
                    ex<br/>cept tat the further of bringing home the Deer<br/> is not so commonly
                    put upon the Wife.<br/> Indians sometimes eating so much at one<br/> time is
                    accounted for from their often fasting<br/> a long time, sometimes several Days,
                    &amp; when<br/> they get Venison it is often eaten alone <br/>
<pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v1_048" n="48"></pb> without Salt, Bread or Vegetables, till<br/> they quite loathe it-
                    when they go on an<br/> Expedition either for Hunting or War, they<br/>
                    frequently take with their only a little par<br/>ched corn pounded with some
                    sugar this is<br/> light of Carriage &amp; nourishing &amp; on such<br/> a Diet
                    they will sustain great hardships<br/> for many Days. H told us that when<br/>
                    he was once in this Country, several years<br/> back, an Indian was going with
                    them<br/> a Journey of Two Days (Perhaps for a Guide)<br/> on enquiry they found
                    he had brought no<br/> Provision &amp; asking why he came without,<br/> he
                    replied- Hoh! I eat enough before<br/> leaving home to last two Days- I am
                    no<br/> Child- I am a Man ~ When at home<br/> they are in the general moderate

                    unfrequently between fourteen<br/> &amp; Eighteen and the Females from
                    twelve<br/> to sixteen- it is also common for many of the<br/> Children to die
                    before they are 4 years Old-<br/> but of those who survive that age in a
                    gener<br/>al way it is supposed they exceed us in <br/>longevity </p>
