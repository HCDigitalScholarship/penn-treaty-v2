<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<p>about 3 Quarters of an Acre being encompassd by <unclear>which</unclear><br/>
                    entrenchment apparently intended for Pikes and having a <br/> level Gateway on
                    the back side. It occupies a consider<br/>able Entrance or open up the
                    mountains, laying behind which<br/> puts down to the main creek, and is now
                    overgrown w/<br/> heavy Timber of at least an Hundred Years growth.<br/> On our
                    way to the saw mill we passd thro' some very good<br/> corn, where the large
                    Walnut Trees, killd by Girdling, are<br/> standing. As we returnd home stopd at
                    the Village of the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/munseeind">Muncy Indians<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a> &amp; talkd with several,
                    particularly the Chief<br/> Warrior who was informed that we intended a Council
                    to<br/>morrow with the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Cattaraugus Indians<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> &amp;
                    if they had any<br/> thing to communicate to us, they might do it as we
                    passd<br/> thro' their settlement. when we got into the Woods on<br/> the Indian
                    Reservation, curiosity induced us to measure<br/> of the Walnut Trees there
                    growing. One of them appeared by<br/> our Measurement to be 15 Feet 8 Inches in
                    Circumference<br/> another 16 ft 2 Inches &amp; a third 16 ft 5 Inches. at 2 ft
                    6 In<br/> from the level of the Ground. They were also very straight<br/> &amp;
                    tall, we unitedly concluded 60 feet without a [?]<br/> &amp; held their
                    thickness remarkably well. there is little<br/> Doubt but we could have found
                    larger had we gone to<br/> hunt them but these all stood close by our Road.
                    On<br/> getting to the House we also measured several<br/> Poplar stumps all
                    within about 60 yards of it--on<br/> being 5 Feet 4 1/2 Inches in Diameter at
                    the heighth of<br/> 4 ft 4 Inches over, at the same heighth <br/>4 Feet, 4 &amp;
                    5 Inches over, at near the same heighth.</p>

                    inform us that<br/> they were ready, &amp; we accordingly went, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egran1">Erasmus Granger<persname key="egran1"></persname></a>, the Agent of the United States

                    Company--he had<br/> unexpectedly met us here being on a Visit to the<br/>
                    several settlements of Indians for the purpose of<br/> enquiring into their
                    Improvements &amp; wants, so as to be<br/> enabled to make Report of their
                    situation to the Pre<br/>sident of the U.S. He is a sensible, well informed<br/>

                    but his Countenance wearing the marks<br/> of Care &amp; poor Health.</p>
<p> About noon the Council opend &amp; after sitting a while<br/> in respectful

<p>Brothers We heard you were coming to see us. we are<br/> happy you have
                            now arrivd, and thank the Great<br/> Spirit that He has preserved you
                            thro' a Long Journey<br/> Brothers--We think it is Consistent with His
                            Will<br/> that we should be favoured all to meet here this day<br/> in
                            Council. We are also pleased that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egran1">Mr.

<p>Our Addresses being being read &amp; interpretted to them<br/> by Henry York were
                    well rec'd. The Indians again<br/> sat for a few minutes entirely silent
                    smokeing their<br/> Pipes, which was succeeded by a Whisper among the <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_005" n="5"></pb> Chiefs <del>for some minutes</del> when the same speaker<br/>
                    (sitting) addressd the Agent, inform'g that they understood<br/> he was going to

                    silence &amp; whisper ensued. The Chief<br/> Warrior <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wyund1">Wyundegohta<persname key="wyund1"></persname></a> then rose &amp; holding our<br/> Addresses in his
                    Hand folded as delivered to him, some<br/> times looking on them attentively
                    &amp; then casting his<br/> Eyes round over us &amp; the Council, replied nearly

<p>Brothers attend. We have heard the<br/> speech of our Friends at Phila.
                            by which we un<br/>derstand that you still continue to speak the<br/>
                            same Language to our Nation &amp; we believe your<br/> views towards us
                            are the effect of Pure Friendship<br/> &amp; a desire for our
                            Welfare--and altho' we have<br/> fallen short of your former advices we
                            are<br/> still encouraged to follow your Council &amp; pursue<br/> the
                            Path you have set before us. You remain<br/> anxious we should improve
                            in Habits of Industry<br/> by which we might render our Lives more
                            com<br/>fortable. Brothers we hope you will continue to have<br/>
                            Patience towards us, as Indians cannot adopt<br/> all those Habits at
                            once but we are fully Con<br/>vinced that Industry in Cultivating our
                            Lands is<br/> the only method by which we can receive lasting<br/>
                            Benefits, and we are determined to pursue it <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_006" n="6"></pb> and hope
                            we will still continue to make<br/> a gradual Advancement.<br/> Brothers
                            We understand you wish us to be bene<br/>fitted by the Example of our
                            Friends who are setled<br/> beside us, and wish our Firnds in
                            Philad.<br/> to know we have rec'd considerable satisfac<br/>tion &amp;
                            advantage from them. We all re<br/>joice that they are setled so near,

<p>The Day before the council we had prepared our<br/> Address to them, touching on
                    various subjects<br/> in which we thought it needful they should
                    im<br/>prove--to which <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wyund1">Wyundegohta<persname key="wyund1"></persname></a>
                    replied,</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1809-09-29"></date><placename key="catta1"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers, <br/>you that are now here have<br/> also told us that on
                            looking over our Corn<br/>fields you find we have not made as much<br/>
                            use of the Plow as you could wish. We<br/> find that your Eye sight is
                            straight. We<br/> acknowledge we have been deficient in<br/> this
                            respect, &amp; the fault is our own.<br/> Brothers--A long time ago we
                            requested<br/> you to send us a sett of Mill Irons, you ac<br/>cordingly
                            sent them as you promised--you <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_007" n="7"></pb>also sent us a sett of
                            Smiths Tools--you<br/> have fulfilld all your Engagements with<br/> us.
                            We have not received the advantage<br/> from the saw mill we
                            expected--one rea<br/>son is our People are Deficient in knowing<br/>
                            how to work it--another Reason--the Water<br/> is not sufficient to saw
                            more than one<br/> Quarter of the Year. We have not re<br/>ceived the
                            advantage from the Smith<br/> Tools that we might have done, yet we<br/>
                            have used them more than the Saw Mill-<br/> Some of our people have
                            learned to do<br/> a number of small matters, yet we<br/> acknowledge we
                            have been too neg<br/>lectful of both.<br/> Brothers--You say if our
                            Minds were<br/> more strong to Labour--it would give our<br/> Women more
                            time to learn to spin.<br/> We think this would be a great
                            ad<br/>vantage to us, for if our Women would<br/> learn to spin &amp;
                            make their own Cloth,<br/> the Money which they now use to buy<br/>
                            Cloathes would be saved for other <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_008" n="8"></pb>purposes. We think
                            this would make us<br/> more Independent &amp; Happy, and when we<br/>
                            are Dead our Children will have reason<br/> to rejoice that we have
                            followed your<br/> Instructions.<br/> Brothers--The Reason we have not
                            made more<br/> use of the Plow Irons you sent us is--we have<br/> not
                            had a sufficient number of Oxen, but we<br/> are thankful you have sent
                            them, as we<br/> have now got a number of young oxen<br/> growing up,
                            &amp; hope we shall be able<br/> to use them more.<br/> You observe we
                            have got a great many<br/> Horses &amp; you think it will be better
                            to<br/> have more Cattle &amp; Oxen. Your Remarks<br/> on this subject
                            are just, we have found<br/> inconvenience from so many Horses, for<br/>
                            all the use they seem to be to us is to ride<br/> about home, but when
                            we have occasion<br/> to go amongst White People, we find them<br/> only
                            a Bill of Expence.<br/> Brothers--We are thankful for your<br/> friendly
                            advice. Our Hearts rejoice <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_009" n="9"></pb> for the Good Council you
                            have given<br/> us, and we wish you to keep your Minds<br/> strong

                    baked a little in the Ashes--the Cakes I<br/> tasted with some reluctance but

                    old Corn is ge<br/>nerally seasoned. The Pidgeons were taken<br/> in the Fingers
                    &amp; eaten with little ceremony<br/> &amp; the soup was obtaind by the aid of

                    pronounced it very good--I however felt<br/> satisfied to take their Word for it

<p>30th. Some of our Co. spent part of the Day<br/> in Walking over the Farm &amp;
                    Viewing the Land<br/> situation for a Grist Mill &amp;c. It is a beauti<gap></gap>ful

                    13 feet square<br/> a second addition is constructed of the<br/> Bark of the

                    the Indians by agreement for that<br/> sum. It was our Lodging &amp; Eating Room
                    while<br/> there--containd two Beds--a Large Table--two<br/> Benches--several

                    considerable conversation relative to<br/> the Indians &amp; among other things
                    got on the sub<br/>ject of their Qualifications for Orratory--he<br/> said one
                    of the most pathetic communications<br/> he had ever heard was from a Young
                    Warrior<br/> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscarora<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> Nation about
                    four years <br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_014" n="14"></pb> ago. The Indians had taken up a couple<br/> of
                    Women for the supposed crime of Witch<br/> Craft--one of these Women they had
                    put to<br/> Death, &amp; the other to extreme Torture to extort<br/> from her a
                    Confession of her Guilt. The<br/> young Warrior was the son of this Woman.<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egran2">Granger<persname key="egran2"></persname></a> having by some means heard what<br/>
                    was going forward among them went to the Wo<br/>mans Relief and remonstrated
                    with them on the<br/> evil &amp; impropriety of such acts--they however<br/>
                    plead with him on the Necessity of taking<br/> the Womans Life &amp; when the
                    found he<br/> continued firm in his Objection, her own<br/> son stepd forth,
                    first lookd to the Ground &amp; then<br/> raising his Eyes in a moving manner a'
                    said<br/> My Friend I hope you will listen to<br/> what I have to say. I am the
                    son of that<br/> Woman--she is my Mother!--She<br/> nursed me when I was a
                    Child, and I<br/> love my Mother!--Her Arms were ex<br/>tended for my

                    but love my Mother? She<br/> clothed me &amp; kept me from all harm<br/> both in
                    sickness &amp; in Health, and you<br/> cannot doubt that I still love my
                        Mo<br/><pb facs="hv_allinsonw_diary_1809_v3_015" n="15"></pb>Mother, yet notwithstanding my strong<br/> attachment to
                    her, I am convinced that<br/> she is a bad Woman &amp; has been the<br/> means
                    of taking the Lives of some of our<br/> People by Witchcraft. I think
                    there<br/>fore she ought to Die, and desire <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egran2">Mr.

                    to my<br/>self &amp; my Brothers we have given<br/> her up for the Good of the Nation.<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egran2">Granger<persname key="egran2"></persname></a> said that the young man (who<br/> was
                    unaccustomed to speaking in public) deli<br/>vered this Expostulatory
                    address<br/> with much emotion, appearing greatly af<br/>fected--&amp; with
                    respect to himself he<br/> said, as nearly as I remember his own lan<br/>guage,
                    that if he was to have had the World<br/> he could not have avoided shedding
                    Tears--<br/> the Life of the Woman however was pre<br/>served &amp; said to be
                    still living <gap></gap><br/> &amp; supported by that Son, but much<br/> deformed by
                    the Tortures they used upon<br/> her. The Chief Warriors Wife paid us a Visit
                    to<br/>day &amp; spent a considerable part of the Time in Spinning<br/> with
                    which she seems much pleasd &amp; performs cleverly.</p>

                    told<br/> that they would leave us the Two Beds &amp; the<br/> Room were we eat,
                    to lodge in--being 5 in num<br/>ber, I told my Co. that I intended to be

                    objected, but I told them I<br/> did not intend returning home without once<br/>
                    making trial of such a mode of Lodging. I<br/> accordingly inverted a
                    Chair--placed my<br/> Saddle &amp; Bags upon it for a Pillow, &amp;<br/> spread

                    Poetical extracts presenting<br/> as appropriate to my situation, I had
                    some<br/> very Instructive Reflections relative to the<br/> protecting care
                    &amp; paternal Regard of an Al<br/>mighty Father, whose Dispensations whether

<p>In the Morning rose<br/> early--fed our Horses &amp; rode about 9 Miles<br/>
                    along the Lake Shore to Breakfast at<br/>

                    consequently<br/> painful both to him &amp; myself yet it did<br/> not entirely
                    prevent me from enjoying the<br/> Grandeiur of the Scenes presented by the<br/>
                    foaming Billows which lashd the shore,<br/> expressing in Accents Rude, yet
                    awful<br/> &amp; Sublime, the Omnipotence of Him who <br/>marks their
                    Boundaries.<br/> The Lake appears to be supplied, not only<br/> by the larger
                    Waters which empty into it.<br/> The Mouths of several of which we crossd,<br/>
                    viz. Smoke &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creek<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>s, but

                    themselves in its hungry Sands<br/> which are so calculated to absorb small<br/>
                    supplies that the returning Billow<br/> is lost to the View, before the Welling
                    is<br/> renewed by its speedy Successor.<br/> The Shore for the most part is
                    coverd with a<br/> Beautiful fine Gravel &amp; small Shells--but in<br/> some
                    places Sand &amp; others mud--in some<br/> places it is receeding &amp; in
                    others forming<br/> &amp; we were told that when there is much<br/> Wind the

                    but<br/> when we cast our Eyes up this Lake<br/> it looks like a mighty sea, and

                    to give hope, on national Ground,<br/> of their general reformation from
                    their<br/> use of Spirituous Liquors, &amp; yet we were<br/> told that many of
                    them have abandoned<br/> this Destroyer &amp; stand firm against

                    intent on proceeding home<br/>ward &amp; could not bear to a
                    Detention--they<br/> therefore advised me to change my Horse<br/> for another,

                    looked very gloomy,<br/> yet seemd the most satisfactory provided I could<br/>
