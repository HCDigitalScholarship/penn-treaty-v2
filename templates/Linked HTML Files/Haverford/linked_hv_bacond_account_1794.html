<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                            Govern-<br/>ment and therefore are not capable of Judging all of
                            your<br/> grievences, especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties
                            of<br/> late years have not fully come to our knowledge; you have<br/>
                            spoken to us respecting the piece of Land between <a href="/places/cayug1">Caynga<placename key="cayug1"></placename></a> &amp;<br/>
<a href="/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creeks<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, as we are

                            satisfactory answer on that<br/> subject. if it appears to be a matter
                            of great importance to you<br/> it would be proper to lay it before him;
                            the Land you mentioned <br/><pb facs="hv_bacond_account_1794_024" n="24"></pb> along <a href="/places/lakee">Lake Erie<placename key="lakee"></placename></a> you have been already acquainted that
                            Congress<br/> has sold it to Pennsylvania &amp; we do not suppose the
                            Commisioner's<br/> has power to relinquish it; it is true that the
                            President and his<br/> Counsellors have impowered a Commissioner to
                            treat with you<br/> but we thing the Government had no design to compel
                            you,<br/> you have Men amongst you of Good Understanding &amp;<br/>
                            sufficient penetration to discover what you Just rights<br/> are &amp;
                            if you minds are not easy with the proposals<br/> that have been made,
                            we make no doubt but the Ears<br/> of the president &amp; the great
                            Counsil of the united states<br/> will be open to hear you &amp; to them
                            we conceive you have<br/> a right to appeal. We desire wisdom may
                            conduce<br/> your Councils that whatever is done may tend to
                            promote<br/> harmony &amp; peace. </p>

                    wrong, will they then abide by it<br/> no longer than they may think it right?
                    If this<br/> be their meaning we may as well let things re-<br/>main where they
                    are. Your Cheif Warrior says<br/> the U- States &amp; the Sachems are now making
                    a <br/>firm peace, but I can not consider it so unless<br/> the Sachems &amp;
                    Warriors both sign the Articles, as it<br/> may create divisions in your

                    you that I<br/> will not deceive you.- I can not consent to close<br/> the
                    Business in this manner, after so much care<br/> &amp; pains has been taking to
                    make every thing agree-<br/>able &amp; satisfactory, I wish you to consider of
                    it<br/> calmly &amp; deliberately and give me an answer <br/>tomorrow.- If the
                    Warriors wish to live in peace<br/> with the U.- States, if they wish to make
                    the Chain<br/> of friendship bright they will sign the Articles of the

<p> 11th Month 1st This Morning the same Chiefs with the Inter<br/>preter attending
                    according to our agreement of yesterday, the following answer as<br/> agreed on
                    was communicated to them </p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<p> Brothers, We have considered what you said to us yesterday &amp; shall
                            answer you<br/> in a few words; We are thankful to the great Spirit that
                            he has preserved us in<br/> health to see each others faces at this
                            Council fire; we &amp; our Brethren at home have<br/> the same good will
                            towards you as our forefathers had, &amp; are desirous to afford you
                            any<br/> service in our power, &amp; that you may cherish peace with one
                            another &amp; with all<br/> Men, believing this will greatly contribute
                            to your happiness; we sympathize<br/> with you in your sufferings &amp;
                            distress, &amp; wish strict justice to be done you respect<br/>ing your
                            Lands, you have been informed we can take no part in war, which is
                            one<br/> great reason why we cannot be active in civil Government &amp;
                            therefore are not capable<br/> of judging of all your grievances,
                            especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties of<br/> late years
                            have not fully come to our knowledge; you have spoken to us respecting
                            the<br/> piece of Land between <a href="/places/cayuc">Caynga<placename key="cayuc"></placename></a>
                            &amp; <a href="/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creeks<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, as we are
                            unacquainted with the<br/> Commissioner's power we can give you no
                            satisfactory answer on that subject, <unclear>[which?]</unclear><br/>
                            appears to be a matter of importance to you, it would be proper to lay
                            it before him; the<br/> Land you mention along <a href="/places/lakee">Lake Erie<placename key="lakee"></placename></a> you have been already acquainted that
                            Congress<br/> has sold it to <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, &amp; we do not suppose the Commissioner
                            has power to<br/> relinquish it; It is true the President &amp; his
                            Counsellors have impowered a Commis<br/>sioner to treat with you, but we
                            think the Government has no design to compel<br/> you, you have Men
                            amongst you of good Understanding &amp; sufficient penetration<br/> to
                            discover what your just rights are, &amp; if your minds are not easy
                            with the proposals that<br/> have been made, we make no doubt but the
                            Ear of the President &amp; the great Council<br/> of the United States
                            will be open to hear you, &amp; to them we conceive you have a
                            right<br/> to appeal; we desire Wisdom may conduct your Councils that
                            whatever is done may<br/> tend to promote harmony &amp; peace. We then
                            returned the Strings of Wampum.</p>

                            I hope<br/> you fully understand now as we have shown them to you we

                            no doubt considered them we wish to know your minds<br/> whether there
                            being any flaw or catch in them which might hereafter occasion<br/>
                            uneasiness. If you think that peace is now established on a good
                            foundation,<br/> we wish you would come forward &amp; sign the Articles,
                            as you are a people who are<br/> desirous of promoting peace &amp; these

<p> Our answer to the Indians was in substance as follows</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<p>Brothers, We left our homes at your request &amp; have freely come to see
                            you &amp; sat<br/> patiently with you during the transactions of the
                            Treaty, we are glad to see the Treaty<br/> Business brought to a close,
                            we hope the chain is brightened &amp; that the peace will<br/> be
                            lasting; we have compared the Articles of the Treaty given to the
                            Indians<br/> with those retained by the United States &amp; find them to
                            be true Copies of<br/> each other, with respect to our signing we hope
                            you will excuse us, for altho'<br/> we believe no deception is intended
                            by the Commissioner, yet there was a num<br/>ber of other people
                            present, &amp; we wish not to be held up to public view, as we<br/>
                            informed you before that we do not interfere with Government as we can
                            take no<br/> part in war; neither do we apprehend ourselves competent
                            judges, as the transac<br/>tions at Treaties held since the war have not
                            fully been made public.</p>
<p> We hope you will abide by the agreement which you have signed &amp; be
                            at peace, &amp;<br/> it is our earnest desire that you might more &amp;
                            more be redeemed from the Spirit<br/> of war &amp; cherish the number of
                            your Friends: We wish that when you apprehend<br/> yourselves agrieved
                            you would make your Grievances know &amp; not seek to revenge<br/> them,
                            as a Society we have had experience of the benifits arising from these
                            <br/><pb facs="hv_bacond_account_1794_044" n="44"></pb> peaceable principles for the space of near 150
                            years, &amp; find we can do better with<br/>out fighting then with it.
                            We still continue to feel the same good will towards<br/> our Brothers
                            the Indians as formerly &amp; are willing in every strait &amp;
                            difficulty to<br/> afford you any assistance in our power. We fervently
                            wish you may live<br/> in Love one with another.</p>

<p> The <a href="/people/farme1">Farmer's Brother<persname key="farme1"></persname></a> then made the following
                    conclusive speech</p>
<floatingtext>
<p>Brothers, We are very glad to see you; when we sent for you, our desire
                            was that<br/> you might sit by our sides &amp; afford your assistance to
                            make a good peace.<br/> Last year we invited you to come to <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>, you willingly rose from your
                            seats<br/> &amp; came forward, you know how things turned out, it was
                            not the will of the great<br/> Spirit that a Treaty should take place,
                            yet we thank you because you came<br/> so readily; we have many times
                            heard the voice of <a href="/places/onas">Onas<placename key="onas"></placename></a>, it as always
                            good to us<br/> we have now heard it again &amp; what you have said is
                            good, you have seen the writ<br/>ings by which we are bound, you say you
                            are not concerned in public affairs, and<br/> no hard thoughts
                            concerning you, on account of your not putting your names<br/> to it.
                            Brothers, the great Spirit give this Island to us the White People have
                            in<br/>creased greatly, there is no difference between the Red People
                            &amp; the White they are all<br/> one &amp; ought to be Brothers &amp;
                            live in Peace one with another. </p>
