</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<p>I left the place of my abode in East Marlborough<br/> and rode about three miles
                    to a friends house<br/> where according to appointment I met with<br/>

<p>being now out of the neighbour<br/>hood of Friends I shall not be particular
                    noteing<br/> the stages till we crops the Mountains, we<br/> trailed about 35

                    mountains whose summits seemed to<br/> mingle with the Clouds afforded a

                    we lodged at the House of a worthy friend<br/>
<a href="/people/tgibs1">Thomas Gibson<persname key="tgibs1"></persname></a>, and were respectfully

<p>three of our company went to<br/>
<a href="/people/rcadw1">Reece Cadwalders<persname key="rcadw1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/hjack1">halliday jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> and myself to<br/>
<a href="/places/uniont">Union Town<placename key="uniont"></placename></a> to see some of our old
                    acquaintance<br/> that lived thereabouts, <a href="/people/hjack1">Halliday<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> and I parted at<br/>
<a href="/people/wdix1">William Dixons<persname key="wdix1"></persname></a> and I went to see my
                    brothers<br/> and Sisters that lived near that place, we<br/> were much rejoiced
                    to see each other and I had a good<br/> degree of satisfaction in my visit, yet
                    my stay was<br/> not as long as would have been desirable, in the course<br/> of
                    my journey through Readstone I observed that the<br/> land is of a supervisor
                    quality, abounding with a great<br/> quantity of excellent timber such as Black
                    Walnut<br/> Hickory Wild Cherry and Sugar Maple from<br/> the latter many of the
                    inhabitants supply themselves<br/> with sugar and molasses of an excellent
                    quality which<br/> is a great advantage to a new settled county.<br/> Stone Coal
                    and Iron Ore of an excellent quality<br/> abounds plentifully in this settlement
                    and<br/> appears to afford encouraging prospects for Iron <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_008" n="8"></pb> works and Blacksmithing. Limestone
                    is also<br/> plenty here and the whole<br/> is encouragement for settlers, yet
                    alas, there is one<br/> abominable practice which the inhabitants<br/> has got
                    into which I think has been a great hurt<br/> to them and their Country, that is
                    destroying<br/> the grain that was given them for the support<br/> of Life to
                    make an article which tends very<br/> much to destroy both the lives and Souls
                    of men,<br/> and set up the Kingdom of Antichrist, I have<br/> often thought
                    that Spirituous liquors is one of the<br/> strongest weapons the Adversary has
                    to make<br/> use of in order for the upholding of his Kingdom,<br/> for when
                    people are enticed to drink large draughts<br/> of it, how easy they are lead in
                    to an innumer<br/>able catalogue of evils such as gambling, lying,
                    swear<br/>ing, fighting, and sometimes to murder.</p>

                    and<br/> Goods that came to his hands, and forward them<br/> to us if
                    convenient, he also provided us a pilot<br/> to go to <a href="/places/conew">Conewango<placename key="conew"></placename></a>, through an uninhabited<br/> wood except by a few
                    families, in the<br/> afternoon we set forward with our pilot<br/> and reached
                    the House of James Tite[a?]s on the fertile<br/> banks of <a href="/places/oilcr">Oil Creek<placename key="oilcr"></placename></a> where we were kindly en<br/>tertained without money
                    or price, here we<br/> put bells on our Horses and let them run<br/> loose in
                    the woods, the Man of the Hous informed<br/> us that he had gathered three
                    Barrells of Oil<br/> in one year off the Waters of <a href="/places/oilcr">Oil
                        Creek<placename key="oilcr"></placename></a>, and <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_013" n="13"></pb> sold it at the rate of four Dollars
                    per Gallon it<br/> being an excellent medicine, a few rods from<br/> the House
                    was a stream of water which ap<br/>peared large enough to turn a Saw-mill<br/>
                    the Man of the House informed us that it<br/> proceeded from one Spring about
                    20<br/> rods above </p>

<p>set forward through the<br/> Woods, and followed the course by marked<br/> trees,
                    which our pilot had done the Summer<br/> before, we found the way worse this Day
                    than<br/> any we had hitherto met with, some places<br/> very hilly and a
                    multitude of trees and old<br/> Logs lying in the way, which made it very<br/>
                    difficult getting along, other places the Ground<br/> being pared with the roots
                    of large trees with<br/> many cavities between them, and overgrown<br/> with
                    moss which made it very dangerous<br/> crossing, in the evening we arived at the
                    House of<br/> James Justice on the Waters of Brokenstraw<br/> where we lodged
                    that night on the floor<br/> by the fire as we did the night before </p>

<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_014" n="14"></pb> Town is laid out on a piece of Land
                    belonging<br/> to the State of Pennsylvania at this place<br/> we met with a
                    company of Indians some<br/> of whom were much intoxicated and appeared<br/>
                    miserably dirty and frightfull, having large loops<br/> cut in their Ears and
                    chunks of lead hanging to them<br/> to stretch them down, here we stayed all
                    night<br/> it being the end of our pilots journey and<br/> about 60 Miles from

<p>employed one of the aforsaid<br/> Indians to pilot us to <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>s Village<br/> about 15 Miles, found the road
                    extremely difficult<br/> on account of old longs and trees lying down,<br/>
                    about 2 o clock in the afternoon we arrived<br/> at <a href="/places/cornp">Genusshadega<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> where we were surrounded<br/> by a company of
                    Indians who in a friendly man<br/>ner came and shook hands and appeared to<br/>
                    give us a hearty welcome, amongst whom<br/> was <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> the principal Chief, who<br/> in a friendly manner
                    conducted us to his House<br/> where we informed him that we were Quakers<br/>
                    and had come a great distance to see the In<br/>dians, he made answer and said
                    he had heard<br/> of our coming and that he was glad and<br/> thankful to the
                    Great Spirit for our safe <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_015" n="15"></pb> arrival and preservation on the way </p>
<p>After we had unsadled our horses &amp; sat down<br/> in the House <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> asked us if we could<br/> eat in his way
                    (being pretty hungry) one of<br/> our company answered he thought we could<br/>
                    the old Man then ordered some Victuals to be<br/> brought which I suppose was
                    the best the House<br/> could afford, but not being accustomed to their<br/>
                    sort of diet and cooking, we made a small por<br/>tion serve at that time, after
                    we had done eat<br/>ing we informed him something of our business<br/> and that
                    we desired to have his<br/> People collected together in Council, to which<br/>
                    he replyed he was willing and left it to ourselves<br/> to propose a time,
                    accordingly the next Day<br/> was agreed on at ten o clock, and runners
                    dis<br/>patched to notify the Indians under <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> superintendance, in the evening<br/> the Old
                    Man brought his Wife and Children<br/> into the apartment where we were and
                    in<br/>troduced them to us in a becoming manner,<br/> after conversing a short
                    time his Wife got<br/> up in a friendly manner and shook hands<br/> with us
                    &amp; quitty departed into the other<br/> end of the House where the family <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_016" n="16"></pb> mostly lived; in the evening they
                    brought<br/> us some milk which with the addition of our small<br/> stock of
                    provision made us a good supper, our lodging<br/> was on births on each side of
                    the House raised about<br/> a foot above the Ground, and overspread with
                    Deer<br/> Skins on which we spread our Blankets and rested<br/> pretty
                    comfortably for the first Night in an<br/> Indian Cabin </p>

<p>took a more extensive view of the<br/> Village and the land about it, the Land
                    appears<br/> to be very fertile, being a large flat on the West<br/> side of the
                    River of about 300 Acres inclosed<br/> with a fence, the most of which has been
                    clear<br/>ed (I suppose by the Women) about midway<br/> of this enclosure stands
                    the body of the Village<br/> which contains about 30 or 40 Houses being<br/>
                    from ten to thirty feet in length mostly built<br/> about six feet high and
                    covered with bark,<br/> along each side are generally two births the up<br/>per
                    one about five feet high on which they<br/> throw their lumber and houshold
                    furniture<br/> the lower one is their place of lodging which<br/> also answers
                    the purpose of seats to sit on be<br/>ing about one foot from the Ground.
                    the<br/> fire they have in the center of the House <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_017" n="17"></pb> and a hole in the top of the roof
                    for the<br/> ascension of the Smoke their Houses, are gene<br/>rally very open
                    and cold in the Winter season<br/> and I believe they seldom use more than two
                    Deer skins<br/> and two or three Blankets to bed and often<br/> not so much </p>
<p>This morning <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and his son <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a><br/> came into our apartment and desired to
                    hear<br/> what we had to communicate to the Coun<br/>cil: one of our company
                    informed them that<br/> we were not ready to tell all that we expected<br/> to
                    say when the Council met and that we<br/> believed it right to wait for the Good
                    Spirit to<br/> influence our Hearts before we spoke in Council<br/> but that we
                    were willing to read them a<br/> Letter that we had from our friends in<br/>
                    Philadelphia and another from General<br/>
<a href="/people/gwilk2">James Wilkinson<persname key="gwilk2"></persname></a> in <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> which was<br/> accordingly done and interpreted by
                        <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a><br/> to his Father; About eleven o
                    clock they<br/> blew a horn and the people came in about about<br/> 40 in number
                    among whom was their<br/> principal Men and Chief Warriors many of<br/> them
                    were frightfully painted Black &amp; Red<br/> their Ears cut in great loops with
                    silver or <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_018" n="18"></pb> chunks of led hanging to them to
                    stretch them<br/> down, They had a multitude of broaches, jewels and<br/>
                    Breastplates of Silver about their bodies which<br/> with their belts and straps
                    curiously interwoven<br/> with beads and their fine Mocasons<br/> made a
                    splendid appearance to one not acquaint<br/>ed with Indians; we sat down at one
                    end<br/> of the House I trust with our minds humblingly<br/> exercised under the
                    weight of the concern in which<br/> we were engaged and some of the Indians
                    sat<br/> pretty quiet, yet the greatest number of them<br/> manifested much
                    lightness by talking and<br/> laughing, after siting a short time <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> got up (<a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a> being interpreter) and spoke<br/> nearly as follows </p>

<p>after<br/> a short time of silence we informed them<br/> of the motives of our
                    coming amongst them<br/> and a little explained the nature of our<br/> business,

                            affords us pleasure to find two friends<br/> whom we esteem and love

                            preserve you from every thing that is hurtful<br/> and unkind, and make

                    we gave them such in<br/>formation as they wanted and told them we had<br/> a

                    reply<br/> to what we had said to them yesterday and <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> got up and spoke on behalf of the people<br/>
                    nearly as follows- </p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1798-05-19"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers the Quakers<br/> listen now to what I am going to say to
                            you.</p>
<p>you know Brothers the Red people are poor<br/> they are not like the
                            White People, the<br/> great, Spirit has made them of another
                            lan<br/>guage so that it is very hard for us to un<br/>derstand one
                            another plainly, as there is no<br/> person here that can interpret very
                            well-</p>
<p>Brothers we take great pains to settle the <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_026" n="26"></pb> proposials you made to us
                            but we differ in<br/> opinions and we must take great pains to<br/> have
                            every thing complete.</p>
<p>Brothers we suppose the reason you came<br/> here was to help poor
                            Indians, some way<br/> or other, and you wish the Chiefs to tell<br/>
                            their warriors not to go on as bad as they<br/> have done; and you wish
                            us to take up<br/> work like the White People. Now</p>
<p>Brothers some of our sober Men will take<br/> up work and do as you say,
                            and if they do<br/> well then will your young Men stay lon<br/>ger, but
                            some others will not mind what you<br/> say. </p>
<p>Brothers we cant say a word against<br/> you it is the best way to call
                            Quaker Brothers<br/> you never wished our lands therefore we are<br/>
                            determined to try to learn your ways; and<br/> there young Men may stay
                            here two years<br/> to try, by that line we shall know if Morris<br/>
                            will leave us any land and whether he will<br/> pay us our Money; for
                            last summer we<br/> sold our Land and we dont know yet<br/> whether he
                            shall get our money, but by<br/> that time we shall know, and then if <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_027" n="27"></pb> the young Men likes it and
                            we like it they<br/> may stay longer. </p>
<p>Brothers if your<br/> young men stay here we want them to<br/> learn our
                            young men to read and write</p>
<p>Brothers two of you are a going home again<br/> if they hear any thing
                            about our land or<br/> our money they must write to these young<br/> men
                            have and they must tell us if we are<br/> like to cheated</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> After <a href="/people/cornp2">Complanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> had closed the foregoing<br/>
                    speech we informed them that we were satisfied<br/> with what they had said; and
                    proposed to them<br/> that they should let us have a good piece of<br/> land to
                    work in order to set them an exam<br/>ple and to raise bread for ourselves to
                    eat<br/> but that the land should still be theirs, and<br/> all the improvements
                    we had on it would<br/> also be theirs when we left it; and in order<br/> to
                    know where would be best for us to settle<br/> we told them we must look about
                    their Land<br/> and go to the other village and see the Land<br/> there, and
                    desired that some of their Chiefs<br/> would go with us and show us their
                    land<br/> all which they readily agreed to; we also<br/> informed them that the
                    carpenters tools <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_028" n="28"></pb> and farming utensils that were
                    coming<br/> forward were intended to lend to our<br/> Indian Brothers and that
                    they should be<br/> under the care and notice of our young friends<br/> while
                    they staid here, for they knew<br/> that some of their young Men were<br/> not
                    quite as good as they should be and<br/> if these things were divided amongst
                    them<br/> some of them might pawn them away<br/> for Whisky, and then they would
                    be as<br/> bad off as they were before they go there<br/> to this information
                    some of the old Men<br/> expression their way a hearty approba<br/>tion, and
                    some of the young Men mani<br/>fested a sensibility of its perinanaby a<br/>
                    shamefaced good humoured laugh<br/> After the above observations had taken<br/>
                    plave <a href="/people/cornp2">cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> expressed that as
                    matters<br/> ware now settled we wouold shake hands as<br/> Brothers, and
                    directed his people to come to<br/> us himself first setting them an
                    example<br/> thus the councel ended late in the evening.</p>

                    expected to sit down in silence for that<br/> service, and if any of them had a

                    explored the Land and found a place<br/> which we thought most eligible to make

                            they should give<br/> to your old People that cannot work for<br/>
                            themselves one Bushall out of four of<br/> all the grain &amp;c. they have
                            to spare, the<br/> rest they must have to buy Salt and<br/> other things
                            which they cannot raise<br/> off the ground-<br/> Brothers, In order to
                            encourage you still<br/> more to take up work and follow those good<br/>
                            ways which we pointed out to you; we will<br/> agree to help you a

                            your share ready again<br/> at next summer, and we think you had<br/>
                            better choose one of your Chiefs to keep this<br/> Money for you till
                            the time is is wanted<br/> or perhaps it will be all gone for
                            whisky<br/> or something that won't do you so much<br/> good as a Mill

<p>After the foregoing was read the Indians re-<br/>tired into a private apartment
                    in order to con-<br/>sult each others minds that they might <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_037" n="37"></pb> reply to what we had said, and
                    returned<br/> again in about half and hour and made<br/> the following reply</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1798-05-22"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers We now hear all what you wish<br/> to do among us, you are come
                            here to see<br/> us brothers, you wish us well, you wish us<br/> to
                            become as the White People, the White are rich<br/> and have every
                            thing, the Indians are poor and<br/> have nothing,</p>
<p>Brothers you told us one thing, it would be good for<br/> us to build a
                            Mill, we will consult <a href="/people/ichap1">Cap-tain
                                Chapen<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a>, if he thinks we will get our<br/> Money, and we
                            are able to raise the money<br/> you propose then we will do it</p>
<p>Brothers We know how far you have come to<br/> see us, it is a great ways
                            to the Sea shore where<br/> our fore Fathers once lived, the White
                            People<br/> have cheated us and got our Land from us, and<br/> now we
                            have but little left, and we will try<br/> to learn your way-</p>
<p>Brothers you know there is some bad People<br/> among us, and you know we
                            have been cheated<br/> and that makes us bad, and our minds uneasy,<br/>
                            if we had not been cheated we should have<br/> been very rich People,
                            and had plenty of every <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_038" n="38"></pb> thing, and then our minds would have been<br/> easy and we could
                            think on the Great Spirit</p>
<p>Brothers the reason I mention to you about<br/> being cheated, some of my
                            Warriors won't<br/> mind what I say to them, but will have<br/> their
                            own way, because they know I have often<br/> been cheated by the White
                            People, if I had never<br/> been cheated then my warriors would
                            believe<br/> me and mind what I say to them, but<br/> now they won't
                            mind</p>
<p>Brothers we can't all go to work at once<br/> some of my warriors will go
                            a hunting to<br/> get provisions and sometimes they broke a<br/> Gun and
                            then it takes a great deal of Money<br/> to buy another, and we have
                            very few Hoes &amp;<br/> Axes and such things among us and we are
                            not<br/> able to get them</p>
<p>Brothers I will go along with you to <a href="/places/canan">Canadar-que<placename key="canan"></placename></a> and then we will get matters settled
                            about<br/> the Mill and bring it back to your young men<br/> in
                            Writing</p>
<p>Brothers this is all I have to say we will<br/> now shake hands</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>At the close of the foregoing speech our friends<br/> exprest a few words,
                    representing among <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_039" n="39"></pb> after things the unreasonableness
                    of their present<br/> practice in suffering their Women to work all Day<br/> in
                    the fields &amp; Woods with their Hoes &amp; Axes<br/> whilst they themselves
                    were at the same time<br/> playing with their Bows &amp; Arrows</p>
<p> In order for their advancement into the good ways<br/> and methods of White
                    People, they were recom-<br/> mended to take their boys to work with their
                    mo-<br/>thers and Sisters whilst they were young, and<br/> when they grew older
                    they would not think so<br/> hard of it, Endeavours were also used seriously
                    to<br/> impress on their minds the remembrance<br/> that it was from the Good
                    Spirit they<br/> received every good thing, and that he could<br/> hear every
                    thing they said, and see every<br/> thing they did; and if they were good and
                    in<br/>dustrious he would love them and bless them<br/> with many good
                    things-<br/> After we had one speaking and informed them<br/> we had said all
                    that we had to say at that<br/> time, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> observed that as all thing are<br/> done and settled
                    we will cover the Council<br/> fire, the Council ended to pretty good
                    satisfac-<br/>tion both to us and the Indians tho' a loss was<br/> sensibly felt
                    by us for want of a good Interpreter </p>

<p>While we were sitting in religious re<br/>tirement (which we continued to do
                    twice a week)<br/> we were interrupted by our Boatman who had<br/> arrived at
                    the landing with our goods<br/> which relieved us of some anxiety of mind as
                    the<br/> River was geting low and we were doubtful<br/> of the Boat geting this
                    far at all, the Boat was<br/> 16 Days coming from <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> to this place which after<br/> a stay of about 2
                    hours returned homewards, the<br/> arrival of our Boat afforded us a plentiful
                    stock of<br/> provisions Beding and utensils of various kinds<br/> to work and
                    instruct the natives with, I now feel<br/> myself in a good degree happy and

                    feelingly expressed that he hoped they would<br/> make their mind perfectly easy
                    about their young<br/> Men, for altho he could not answer for sickness<br/> or
                    Death on such things, but as for anything else<br/> he would look upon it his
                    duty always to be<br/> their friend and that they might depend upon him<br/> as
                    such, and that no harm should happen to them<br/> from his People, he concluded
                    his spech with desi-<br/>ring the Great Spirit might preserve them on<br/> their
                    journey, and that he might so order <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_042" n="42"></pb> things that they might find their
                    families<br/> and people well when they got home</p>
<p>We are now settled and got to work at the old and<br/> almost deserted Village
                        <a href="/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> which is<br/> so overgrown
                    with rubbish &amp; bushes as to cause<br/> a great deal of labour to prepare it
                    for the Plaugh<br/> which we started a few Days ago and have plan-<br/>ted a
                    small piece of Corn and also some Vine and<br/> garden Seeds, The Indians are
                    dayly flocking<br/> about us and manifest much kindness and respect<br/> after
                    bringing us Vennison &amp; fish of an excelent<br/> quality, to the Women we
                    often impart small<br/> presents which came for that purpose from<br/> friends
                    in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> for which they returned<br/>
                    many thanks</p>
<p> The dress of the Indian men in warm wea-<br/> ther consists of a short Calico
                    shirt or frock which<br/> comes a little below the waist over which<br/> the
                    ware a fine broad Cloth coat of a lively<br/> coulor mostly Blue or green
                    instead of pantaloons<br/> they wear a piece of fine cloth, their leggens<br/>
                    are mostly blue or green, and some times<br/> superfluously decorated with small
                    beads<br/> and curious straps about their legs, their<br/> moccasons are
                    curiously wrought with ribbands <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_043" n="43"></pb> porcupine quills, and small beads, they are<br/> latterly getting much in the
                    practice of wearing<br/> hats, The dress of the Woman is much like<br/> that of
                    the Men save a short woollen petticoat<br/> and a broadcloth wrapper instead of
                    a coat.<br/> The Women about us have a number of<br/> corn patches interspreed
                    through the bushes<br/> which they tend with their hoes, they<br/> plant the
                    hills about 3 feet apart with<br/> 8 or 10 stalks in a hill, their activity
                    in<br/> hilling and weeding it is somewhat<br/> extraordinary</p>

                    immediate-<br/>ly went and found <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
                    and several<br/> other Indians at the Mill. here we had a<br/> pretty stricking
                    instance of the generosity<br/> of <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, for as we had told the<br/> Indians in council at our
                    first coming <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_044" n="44"></pb> amongst them, that we came not to
                    trade<br/> with them, nor to use any endeavours to<br/> to get their land or
                    skins, therefore he<br/> said he would take no pay of us for<br/> any thing we
                    got from him, but that we<br/> might have as many boards as we wanted<br/>
                    without pay, we got 1000 feet and acknowleged<br/> the old Mans kindness and
                    offered him the<br/> Money which he refused taking as pay for<br/> the boards
                    but as he was in need said he<br/> would borrow it until he received his<br/>
                    annuity from government, and then he would<br/> return it again, which he did
                    accordingly </p>

                    to be pretty well satisfied with our proceed-<br/>ings and said "he was glad to

                    of use to them, and was<br/> glad at this time to see us and have<br/> the

<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_048" n="48"></pb> and said he had somthing to tell

                    many hardships<br/> to pass through in the undertaking, he<br/> also thought
                    that the Indians could not easily<br/> be brought off from their old habits and
                    cus-<br/>toms of living, and that the natural disposi-<br/>tion in them would be
                    hard to change-<br/> and altho' he observed that many of<br/> them were very
                    active and with a little<br/> instruction might learn to work well<br/> yet they
                    wanted tools to work with-<br/> And as to teaching their Children to read<br/>
                    and write it was almost impossible unless<br/> they understood the English
                    language yet<br/> he hoped we would be useful to them<br/> and the tools we
                    brought would be a great<br/> help toward geting them to work And<br/> that him
                    and his people would wait to see<br/> what progress these Indians would make
                    in<br/> the way of farming, and would be glad to<br/> hear of our success in the
                    business, and hoped<br/> we would faithfully discharge our duty and<br/> often
                    caution the young Men to sobriety <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_049" n="49"></pb> and against the use of strong
                    Drink-<br/> We informed him that we were glad to see<br/> him and that he used
                    so much freedom<br/> in telling us his mind, that we expected<br/> bfore we came
                    to have many hardships to pass through &amp;<br/> therefore were prepared for
                    them, but we had<br/> found things much easier than we expected.<br/> That the
                    Indians were very kind to us and<br/> as to their learning to work we
                    thought<br/> there was encouragement and were of the mind that their Children
                    might be learned to<br/> read and write; but we did not expect a<br/> great
                    change would take place very soon but<br/> were willing to wait until the

                    some birds had lately come about and<br/> told them that we intended to go
                    home<br/> next Summer and some others were<br/> coming to take our place. We
                    told them<br/> we had not yet concluded how long we would<br/> stay amongst
                    them, but when we went<br/> away we would let them know our rea<br/>sons for
                    going, and that it was likely<br/> some others would come that would be<br/> of
                    as much benefit to them as ourselves -<br/> and that they must not believe all
                    that<br/> these fires told them. -- But still they<br/> seemed uneasy with their
                    information<br/> and said <said>you have told us what to do and<br/> if you go
                        away and some others comes they<br/> will tell us another story, then
                        how<br/> shall we know which is right</said>: we reply<br/> that the Quakers
                    would all tell them<br/> the same story and that they need<br/> not be uneasy in
                    that respect. <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_051" n="51"></pb> after the foregoing information

<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_053" n="53"></pb> of their Land and thought it very
                    good, and<br/> well situated for cultivating, to which the chief<br/> replyed,
                    that him and his people<br/> had it in contemplation for some time<br/> past and
                    was very desirous of being instructed<br/> therein, that they had a prospect of
                    building a Sawmill<br/> and had come to a conclusion, that every young<br/> man
                    should advance a part of his annuity from<br/> Government into the hands of a
                    treasurer until<br/> they had enough to build the Mill, that<br/> they were very
                    desirous of having some per-<br/>son amongst them to instruct their
                    children<br/> but knew not where to apply, for when the<br/> Quakers came

<a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> kept us among his people, and<br/>
                    now they saw and heard what we had done<br/> here and that made them anxious to
                    go<br/> to work, but they wanted some tools to<br/> go on with but ware not able
                    to purchase<br/> them; and if they should succeed in build-<br/>ing the Saw Mill
                    they would want some<br/> instruction how to go on with it</p>
<p> We then<br/> informed him of the motives of our society in<br/> settling amongst

                    had been<br/> addressed and sent to these Nations of Indians<br/> to know if any
                    of them were desirous of having friends<br/> to instruct their Children in the
                    useful habits of<br/> good and honest White people, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a><br/> was the only Chief that consented to
                    receive<br/> us and therefore we came amongst his people<br/> but that the way
                    was still open for others to<br/> make application, and if the Chiefs and<br/>
                    warriors of <a href="/places/catta1">Cataraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a> Village were
                    desirous<br/> of having any assistance from our society<br/> and would send
                    their minds to us in<br/> writing we would forward it to our friends<br/> in
                        <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and perhaps some
                    assistance<br/> would be given them- <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_055" n="55"></pb> we then asked him if they were
                    desirous<br/> of aplying to our society or to the United States<br/> To all
                    which he replyed <said>I am very<br/> thankfull of an opportunity of such
                        information<br/> there is no people affords such encouragement<br/> as you
                        do. We have often heard from <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn-planters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> that they had found you punc-<br/>tual to
                        your words in every thing you<br/> told them in the begining, and that
                        they<br/> could not find the least fault with you<br/> in any one thing. And
                        now I hear<br/> you with my own ears and believe what<br/> you say, and am
                        determined to apply<br/> to you before any other People in the World<br/>
                        and as soon as I return home we will<br/> hold a council and send our
                        minds<br/> to you in Writing for you to forward<br/> to your Friends, And if
                        any of your<br/> People should come amongst us, they<br/> shall have Land to
                        settle on where ever<br/> they want it, or anything that is ours that<br/>
                        they stand in need of.</said>

<p> About this time a number<br/> of Indians arrived from <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> where they<br/> had been to dispose of their Skins
                    furs<br/> &amp;c. and brought in return a great quantity of<br/> Whisky which they
                    sold to other Indians<br/> at home which soon caused much confusion<br/> and
                    intoxication amongst the Indians at <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_058" n="58"></pb>
<a href="/places/cornp">Cornplanters<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> Village insomuch that we<br/>
                    felt a disposition (or rather a freedom) to have<br/> the Indians generally
                    collected that we<br/> might endeavour to make them sensible<br/> of their
                    misconduct and press upon them<br/> the bad affects of that pernicious and
                    destruct-<br/>ive article, accordingly a time was agreed<br/> on and about 20 of
                    those that were sober<br/> attended, where we communicated to<br/> them our
                    concern for their wellfare and<br/> happiness and also the many bad
                    affects<br/>that the use of strong drink produced and<br/> solicited them to lay
                    out their Money<br/> in future for clothing, farming utensils,<br/> domestic
                    animals, and such like ne-<br/>cessary things: and in a short time they<br/>
                    might become farmers and have<br/> Milk, meat, and Clothing plenty, instead<br/>
                    of the Elk they might knock down<br/> the Cow and instead of the Deer they
                    might<br/> kill the Sheep, and Swine, which would<br/> supply them plentifully
                    with good meat<br/> without exposing themselves to so <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_059" n="59"></pb> much toil and hardships wandering<br/>
                    thro' the Snow when it is 2 or 3 feet<br/> deep, The Indians sat pretty quiet
                    and some<br/> of them appeared somewhat convicted, they in-<br/>formed us that
                    they would consult each other<br/> and others of their people when they get
                    sober<br/> and give us an answer another time. A few<br/> Days after the Indians
                    assembled again and<br/> made reply to what we had said to them the<br/>
                    substance is nearly as follows <said>We have made<br/> enquiry and conversed
                        with each other concern-<br/>ing you, but can find no faith in all your<br/>
                        proceedings, but find you just and upright in<br/> all your ways amongst us,
                        and that the<br/> fault and bad conduct lies on our own side<br/> We wish
                        you to make your minds easy<br/> concerning us, for we intend to take
                        your<br/> advice and try to do better. And we are<br/> determined not to let
                        any more Whisky<br/> be exposed for sale amongst us. We have<br/> appointed
                        the young Chiefs to have the over-<br/>sight of those that misconduct in
                        future.<br/> We will now take up work and assist our<br/> Women in the labor
                        of the field- </said></p>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_060" n="60"></pb>
<p>About this time we received a Letter from<br/> our friends in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> desiring one<br/> of us to go to
                        <a href="/people/gwilk1">John Wilkins<persname key="gwilk1"></persname></a> farm at<br/>
<a href="/places/hicko">Hickory Town<placename key="hicko"></placename></a> about 50 miles down this<br/>
                    River for a yoke of Oxen which journey<br/> fell upon myself, and I employed
                    an<br/> Indian lad and embarked in a Canoe<br/> with several others Indians
                    bound for<br/>
<a href="/places/frank">Franklin<placename key="frank"></placename></a>, and arrived at <a href="/places/hicko">Hickory Town<placename key="hicko"></placename></a> in<br/> about one Day and having had
                    a<br/> prospect before I left home of geting a<br/> Milch Cow at this place and
                    not find-<br/> ing any here for sale, I concluded to ex-<br/>tend my enquiries
                    farther and according-<br/>ly went on foot as far as <a href="/places/hicko">Hickory Town<placename key="hicko"></placename></a><br/> but found none for sale. I then returned
                    again<br/> to <a href="/places/hicko">Hickory Town<placename key="hicko"></placename></a> got a yoke of Oxen
                    and<br/> proceeded homewards, the first days travel<br/> found the road very
                    rough and Mountain-<br/>ous and in some places no path to be seen<br/> at all.
                    The second day about dark got within<br/> 3 or 4 miles of <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> Town where we<br/> were oblidged to lodge in the
                    woods without any<br/> provisions or go home in the dark which <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_061" n="61"></pb> would be a very disagreeable
                    journey, however<br/> we concluded to leave the Oxen in the woods<br/> and try
                    if we could get to the town, which<br/> we did with some difficulty being
                    pretty<br/> tired and hungry, next day the cattle were<br/> brought home by some
                    Indians</p>
<p> After my return I was for several days engag<br/> in the Carpenter-works of a
                    School House about<br/> half a mile from <a href="/places/genes1">Genisshadego<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> where the Indians<br/> propose building a new
                    Town, while I was thus<br/> engaged I received information that agreeable to<br/>
<a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> orders three of his men had
                    ta-<br/>ken the life of an Indian Woman, who had<br/> been for some time past
                    strongly suspected<br/> by the natives for having the art of witchcraft<br/> and
                    was so despised that her husband put her away<br/> and took another woman for
                    his wife, (which<br/> as the story goes) so enraged her, that she<br/>
                    threatened to take the life of a young child a<br/> relation to her former
                    husband. This circumstance<br/> very much agitated the minds of some of the
                    Indians<br/> insomuch that <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> ordered
                    three of<br/> his men immediately to take her life, she<br/> being at that time
                    at work in the cornfield<br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_062" n="62"></pb> with a
                    number of other Women who were<br/> much alarmed to behold their companion<br/>

<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1799-09-12"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p> Brothers You have now heard that our<br/> coming here was to see how you
                            and our<br/> young men who are living among you<br/> are getting along.
                            We are glad that the Good<br/> Spirit has favoured us to meet you in
                            health<br/> and given us this opportunity of taking<br/> you by the hand
                            and brighening the <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_063" n="63"></pb> Chain of friendship. Now
                            Brothers we should<br/> like to hear from your own mouths if you are
                            quite satis-<br/>fied with our young men living amongst you<br/> they
                            came here with an hope of being useful<br/> by instructing you in a
                            better way of managing<br/> your Land and providing for yourselves
                            and<br/> Cattle, we desire you to speak freely</p>
<p>Brothers it has been some satisfaction to us<br/> in riding thro' your
                            Town to see marks of indu-<br/>stry taking place, that you are building
                            better<br/> and warmer Houses to live in and that so much<br/> of your
                            cleared Land is planted with Corn,<br/> Potatoes &amp;c. and to see those
                            articles kept in<br/> good order</p>
<p>Brothers We observe where your new houses<br/> are building that the
                            timber is very much<br/> cut off a rich flat which we wish you
                            encou-<br/>raged to clear and make it fit for plow-<br/>ing we believe
                            it to be very good Land for<br/> Wheat as well as Corn and as the
                            White<br/> People are setting around you the Deer and<br/> other game
                            will grow scarcer and more difficult<br/> to be taken. We therefore hope
                            that more of your<br/> Men will assist in clearly Land, fencing it,
                                <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_064" n="64"></pb> planting it with
                            corn and sowing it with Wheat.<br/> you will then have a supply of
                            provisions more<br/> certain to depend upon than hunting</p>
<p>Brothers we were pleased to see your stock<br/> of cattle increased. The
                            rich bottom on the<br/> river will yield plenty for them to live on<br/>
                            in the Summer Season, but as your win-<br/>ters are long and cold it
                            will require some<br/> thing for them to live on in Winter.<br/> Now the
                            white people keep thin cattle<br/> on hay, straw and cornfodder,
                            straw<br/> you cannot get until you raise wheat or<br/> other grain, the
                            rich bottoms if they ware<br/> put in order would produce a great deal
                            of<br/> hay, but for an immediate supply, we<br/> think as soon as you
                            gather your corn<br/> you should cut the stalks close at the<br/> ground
                            bind them in small bundles<br/> and put them in stacks as our<br/> young
                            men do they would keep the<br/> cattle part of the cold weather</p>
<p> Brothers We are pleased to see a<br/> a quantity of new fence made this
                            sum-<br/>mer near where our young men live <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_065" n="65"></pb> and we would not have you
                            get discouraged<br/> at the labour it takes for if you will<br/> clear a
                            little more land every year and<br/> fence it you will soon get enough
                            to raise<br/> what Bread you want as well as some<br/> for grass to make
                            hay for winter</p>
<p>Brothers we understand you are desirous to<br/> discourage whisky from
                            being brought among<br/> you with which we are much pleased<br/> and
                            should be glad if you would entirely<br/> keep it away, for to get it
                            you give your<br/> money which you should have to buy clothes<br/> with
                            and to buy Oxen and ploughs with<br/> to work your land, and it does not
                            do<br/> you any good</p>

<p>After the foregoing writings wore<br/> read one of our friends was favoured
                    in<br/> a lively manner to communicate<br/> some suitable hints of advice to the
                    Na-<br/>tives well adapted to their present<br/> state</p>
<p>Before the council ended <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a><br/> told

<p>On the first day following<br/> we had a very satisfactory meeting in our<br/>

<p> The next day <a href="/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharpless<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> fell

                    little recovered we found that he<br/> was not very badly wounded, tho we<br/>
                    were doubtful of his being able to tra-<br/>vel next day which was the time
                    appo-<br/> inted for their departure, but they got<br/> themselves in readyness
                        (<a href="/people/jshar1">Joshua<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> being anxious<br/> for going) and
                    took an affectionate farewell<br/> opportunity with us and set off about

<a href="/places/canad">upper Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a> in order to pay a visit to<br/>

                    letter<br/> that was wrote and left at <a href="/places/buffc1">Buffalo

                    swallowed it in their breath and Hearts<br/> that they were going to lay up

<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_068" n="68"></pb> Dollars of their annuity to buy

                    traders brought it amongst them they would<br/> order them off the ground. We
                    returned them<br/> the following answer by the aforesaid Chiefs.</p>
<floatingtext>
<opener>To the Chiefs and others of <a href="/people/seneca">Cataraugus<persname key="seneca"></persname></a><br/>
<salute>Friends and Brothers</salute></opener>
<p>We received your<br/> letter in company with one to <a href="/people/cornp2">Captain Obeal<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and are glad to find that
                            you got a<br/> good understanding of what our friends<br/> wrote to you
                            at <a href="/places/buffc1">Buffalo Creek<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a> and that the<br/>
                            instruction they gave pleased you generally,<br/> Now Brothers we did
                            not see that speech<br/> that our friends left at <a href="/places/buffc1">Buffalo Creek<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a> for you<br/> but as you are
                            determined to take their advice<br/> and have already swallowed it down
                            in your<br/> breasts we hope you often remember and con-<br/>sider
                            it</p>
<p> Brothers we are glad to hear that you have <br/><pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_069" n="69"></pb>come to a resolution to lay up so
                            much of your<br/> money in order to buy Cattle and other useful<br/>
                            articles, and that you are determined to quit<br/> drinking whisky and
                            not to allow any traders to<br/> sell it on the ground- Now Brothers
                            this<br/> is a very wise resolution in you and we hope<br/> you will be
                            sincere and keep to it, we heartily<br/> wish all the Indian tribes
                            would join you in<br/> driving Whisky and Rum out of the Land.<br/> We
                            hope some of you have got you Eyes opened<br/> to see that Whisky and
                            strong drink has been<br/> the cause of much evil and wickedness
                            amon-<br/>gst you, and that it has taken away much of<br/> your money,
                            your skins, and your furs which<br/> the Great Spirit has given you to
                            buy blankets,<br/> clothing, axes, hoes, and other useful articles<br/>
                            to assist you in tilling the field. And we fear<br/> in time past it has
                            taken away some of<br/> the corn your poor Women has worked<br/> hard at
                            raising with their hoes-<br/> Brothers you must know that there are
                            many<br/> white people that love money and they<br/> know that you love
                            Whisky and this is <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_070" n="70"></pb> the way they take to get
                            your money and<br/> property from you, But if you keep to your<br/>
                            resolution not to drink it then there will<br/> be no danger, You will
                            then have money<br/> to buy Oxen and ploughs to plow your ground<br/>
                            and raise a great deal of corn, and to buy Axes,<br/> and hoes, and
                            other useful articles to go to<br/> farming with; And then when
                            your<br/> Brothers the Quakers hear that you are<br/> trying to do good
                            for yourselves and making<br/> good use of your money it will
                            encourage<br/> them to help you more</p>
<p> Brothers we want you often to think on<br/> the Great Spirit and to pray
                            to him in your<br/> Hearts and then he will show you what is<br/> good
                            and what is evil. And we desire<br/> you to take up work like the
                            white<br/> people, for your land we believe is very<br/> good and will
                            produce a great deal of grain<br/> if you are industrious; And when you
                            get<br/> plenty of cattle, Swine and Sheep they will<br/> afford you
                            plenty of meat and be much<br/> easier taken than the Elk the Deer and <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_071" n="71"></pb> Bear, then will your old
                            men, your wives,<br/> and your children, be happy and enjoy<br/> the
                            comforts of life, and you will look<br/> on your flocks your fields and
                            your fruit<br/> trees with contentment and pleasure-<br/> Brothers and
                            Sisters we are young men<br/> and can't say a grat deal to you but
                            we<br/> intend to send an account how you<br/> are coming on to our

                    years devotion, at which times they<br/> are mostly careful to collect all the
                    Silver<br/> tinkling ornaments, and fine apparel that<br/> they are master of. I
                    changed to see a broad-<br/> cloth wrapper that belonged to one of our<br/>
                    neighbour women the lower end of which<br/> contained 790 silver broaches which
                    would<br/> average at about one shilling a piece exclu-<br/>sive of about 60
                    dols worth of silver crosses, the<br/> upper end was faced with broad
                    ribones<br/> which was computed at about 15 dols price<br/> the whole amount of
                    the wrapper was es-<br/>timated at 180 Dollars. Yet altho she had<br/> abundance
                    of superfluous clothing she lived<br/> in a poor little dirty House. I was

                    as I had<br/> some business there and returned home<br/> in four Days having
                    lodged comfortably two<br/> nights in the woods, and partook of a plentiful <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_076" n="76"></pb> supply of venison and fish which
                    the Indians<br/> killed by the way</p>
<p> An unfortunate circumstance happened among<br/> a company of Indians that was
                    lately hunting<br/> on the waters of Beaver and had pitched this<br/> tent near
                    a white mans house who kept<br/> Whisky to sell which occasioned some
                    difference<br/> between the White Man and one of the Indians<br/> the White at
                    length got other ruffians to assist<br/> him in taking the lives of the Indians
                    who<br/> were not aprised of their intentions, in order to<br/> prosecute their
                    horrid plan they went to<br/> the Indians camp with Guns and imediately<br/>
                    shot one of them dead on the spot another<br/> seeing what was done immediately
                    attem-<br/>pted to make his escape with a child under<br/> each arm but was
                    followed by a ball which<br/> wenet thro' his breast and thro' the

<p> About this time considerable<br/> uneasyness arose in the minds of some of
                    the<br/> Indians from being informed by a <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_077" n="77"></pb> malicious white Man that my motives
                    in<br/> coming here was to try to get a mile square<br/> of Land from them as I
                    had been here ever<br/> since the settlement was first established<br/> for the
                    improvement of the Natives, two<br/> Indians came to talk with us on the
                    occasion<br/> and we endeavoured to convince them<br/> that the report was
                    intirely groundless and<br/> that we did not want any of their Land<br/> nor
                    other property for any of our service<br/> amongst them</p>

<p> we received informa-<br/> of the Death of Hyute a young indian man<br/> that had
                    been lately married who after<br/> about eight days illness died at his
                    hunt-<br/>ing camp in the woods about 17 miles<br/> from home. The above
                    information caused<br/> me some serious reflections, as he was a<br/> young man
                    in the bloom of life and<br/> flower of his Days, and in health just a few<br/>
                    days before, I was led to reflect on the un<br/>certainty of our existance here
                    in this<br/> world and how very necessary it is for every<br/> one to be
                    prepared at any hour to<br/> meet the messenger of Death</p>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_078" n="78"></pb>
<p>The death of Hyute led me to enquire<br/> of one of our neighbours how the
                    Indians<br/> divided the property of a deceased person.<br/> I was informed that
                    it is commonly divi-<br/>ded amongst the brothers and sisters<br/> of the
                    deceased. the Wife or Children having<br/> no claim thereto, but in former
                    times<br/> they buried the apparrel with the corps<br/> and then burned the
                    House with<br/> all of its contents</p>

<p> 20 or 30 Indians<br/> called at our house being on their way<br/> to <a href="/places/cornp">Genisatego<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> to perform their half<br/> years worship
                    and notwithstanding I<br/> have never been to see them I will en-<br/> deavour,
                    to give a brief account of their<br/> proceedings which I had by
                    information.<br/> In the first place they are very zealous<br/> to have their
                    people generally collected<br/> some that are not able to walk are hauled<br/>
                    by two or three of their friends ten or twelve<br/> miles on the ice or snow
                    wrapped up in Blan-<br/>kets, buck-skins, when the necessary prepa-<br/>rations
                    are made they place themselves<br/> in a circle round a large image which is <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_079" n="79"></pb> erected on a pedestal about six
                    feet high<br/> and having a white Dog skined and dres-<br/>ed they lay him on a
                    hot fire which is<br/> previously prepared for the purpose, and<br/> while he is
                    consuming one of the Chiefs<br/> on behalf of the people addresses the
                    Great<br/> Spirit in thanksgivings for the game<br/> they have been permited to
                    take in their<br/> hunting hours, after this is done another<br/> Chief takes
                    about half a pound of Tobacco<br/> lays it on the fire and addresses the
                    people<br/> by way of admonition and exhortatin<br/> During the rendevous they
                    are dressed in their<br/> best apparrel and many of them have their<br/> faces
                    painted in many frightful wild looking<br/> figures and their heads decorated
                    with feathers<br/> painted different colours and beaded belts &amp;<br/>
                    Mockasons which altogether forms a very wild ro-<br/> mantic appearances to one
                    not acquain-<br/>ted with Indians. They continue their<br/> dancing and
                    different manuevers about<br/> six or seven Days with an abundance of
                    rattling<br/> and tinkling ornaments about their feet<br/> and legs and their
                    clothes decorated with<br/> hundreds of silver broaches, breasplates &amp;c. <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_080" n="80"></pb> on their way home many of them<br/>
                    called at our House amongst them was<br/> an elderly female Chief with whom<br/>
                    we had considerable conversation, amongst<br/> other things she observed that
                    the Indian<br/> Women had too great a burden to labour under<br/> for the Men
                    would work but little, the Women<br/> had to cut and carry home all the fire
                    wood,<br/> plant &amp; raise all the Corn pound it &amp;<br/> prepare it for
                    eating, and when it was<br/> ready the Men must eat first, and when<br/> the Men
                    killed any Deer the Women had to<br/> carry home the meat and what was
                    worse<br/> than all the Men often got Drunk and<br/> then they would beat and
                    abuse the<br/> Woman and yet they had to bear it all.<br/> I was a little
                    pleased with the old Womans<br/> remark as many of them do not seem<br/> willing
                    their husbands should work.</p>

                    set out homeward<br/> of the being very rainy and disagree-<br/>able traveling:

<p> This being the time agreed on<br/> by some of the Indians to have the

                    Ancient man who was<br/> a very great Speaker belonging to the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondago<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> Nation, and held in much<br/> esteem
                    by the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, he having re-<br/>ceived some
                    previous information of<br/> the contents of the Governors letter<br/>
<a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> having opened it and had<br/> some
                    parts of it explained before it<br/> came to our and seemed somewhat<br/>
                    disaffected towards the Governor, and intimated<br/> to some of his people that
                    the letter should be burned<br/> before the letters were read the <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondaga<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> Chief<br/> spoke a considerable time
                    requesting them<br/> to pay attention to the Governors advice said<br/> he

<p>After the aged chief had done speaking the<br/> Governors letter and one from
                    Friends in<br/> Philadelphia was read and interpreted<br/> to them which very
                    much contradicted<br/> their absurd belief in witchcraft which<br/> seemed
                    considerably to agitate the mind<br/> of <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, yet some others appeared<br/> to receive it pretty
                    well and appeared to<br/> be somewhat ashamed for having before<br/> entertained
                    such foolish notions-<br/> After the letters directed to the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/> were read <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> insisted on having<br/> those read, which were
                    directed to the <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Munceys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a> we informed him
                    that the Governors<br/> Letter was sealed and that we did not wish<br/> to break
                    it open, but if he had a mind<br/> to open it we would read it at the same<br/>
                    time cautioning him against it but the<br/> Governor or the <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Muncys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a> might be displeased<br/> Still the old man
                    insisted upon opening the<br/> letter and having it read which was done<br/> he
                    afterward signified that it should be burnt<br/> for said he, it will do the
                        <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Muncys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a> more harm<br/> than good- another
                    Chief said he was not<br/> of the same mind and he thought it would<br/> be best
                    for all the Chiefs to shead their sinti<br/>ments on the occasion, that it was
                    his mind<br/> that it would be best for the letter to be<br/> forwarded to them-
                    it was afterwards agreed<br/> that all the letters to both parties should<br/>
                    be explained to all the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> Chiefs at<br/>

                    ber of Indians and told them he had lately<br/> needed instructions from Heaven
                    by three<br/> men whom he stated he had previously seen<br/> these men had told
                    him many things, that<br/> the Indians shamed keep up their old prac<br/>tice
                    and manner of claiming for that was<br/> right and if they did so the Great
                    Spirit would<br/> send into their woods great plenty of game<br/> and cover
                    their ground with a new and rich<br/> soil whereby the Indians may live
                    plen<br/>tifully without much labor and that it was<br/> not right for them to
                    raise wheat and corn<br/> to sell to one another but they were right<br/> in
                    wearing old and ragged clothes and in<br/> painting their skins and tanning
                    often which<br/> was pleasing to the great spirit. These and<br/> often such
                    like foolish and supersitious doc<br/>trines and nations tends very much to
                    obstruct<br/> the work of civilization being calculated to suit<br/> the weak

                    little displeased with<br/> the Quakers being amazed then and as we<br/> were

<p>Took my departure from <a href="/places/genes1">Geneshingutla<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> in
                    company with the Cornplanter after a solemn leave of those we <br/>left behind
                    and a number of Indians<br/> that collected to witness our departure<br/>
                    travelled about 20 miles through the woods<br/> having a very rough road and
                    some rain<br/> encompassed about 4 oclock and rested pret<br/>ty comfortable
                    next morning set forward<br/> and found the road find some places upstream<br/>
                    by bad until we came to <a href="/places/catta1">Cattaraugas<placename key="catta1"></placename></a>
                    kind<br/> man which there is abundance of land of<br/> the best quality and the
                    most beautiful tim<br/>ber I ever saw chiefly Black Water and Pop<br/>lar bar
                    after passing about six miles down the<br/> river we came to the <a href="/places/catta1">Cattaraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a> Village<br/> and lodged in the house of
                    the Chief Warrior<br/> and was kindly entertained, his wife en<br/>deavouring to

                    follow<br/>ed a rough disagreeable path about 7 miles<br/> to <a href="/places/lakee">Lake Erie<placename key="lakee"></placename></a> which opened to my view a<br/> very

                    contemplative<br/> mind we rode at the rate of about<br/> five miles per hour,
                    until we came<br/> to a stream of water called Carigua<br/>ga where we encamped
                    by the side of<br/> the lake and represented ourselves and<br/> know with
                    provisions we carried<br/> with us, we pushed out tent and had<br/> a pretty
                    comfortable night lodging<br/> although cattle<br/> are frequent in these
                    parts<br/> &amp; fed our horses and took breakfast<br/> and set forward on our
                    journey about<br/> six o'clock being pleasingly entertain<br/>ed by the curious
                    lands of the Lake<br/> which in some places we thought<br/> was 80 or 90 feet
                    perpendicular and<br/> interested with different kinds of<br/> stone many of the

<p> set out for Ng early and rode<br/> about 20 miles to the falls of <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a><br/> the greatest Phenomenon and the
                    most<br/> gratifying sight I had ever beheld<br/> the water beginning a very
                    rapid de<br/>scent about three quarters of a mile<br/> above the cataract,
                    there<br/> is an Island of 10 or fifteen acres<br/> just above the precipice
                    which divides<br/> the sheet of water in its fall at one<br/> patch of 150 feet,
                    a continual mist<br/> arises which may be seen for many<br/> miles and it is
                    thought the roar<br/>ing of the Cataract may be heard for<br/> 20 or 30 miles on
                    a still morning, a<br/> short distance above there are erec<br/>ted a Grist
                    mill, Saw mill, and Forge<br/> and excellent seats for that purpose<br/> there
                    are 17 saws in one frame<br/> which cuts a log in to boards at<br/> one through,
                    and would I should sup<br/>pose cut 10,000 feet of boards in a day,<br/> several
                    other miles are in contem<br/>plation at the same place after<br/> viewing the
                    falls from the top we<br/> went about half a mile down the<br/> river, and
                    descended about 35 feet<br/> by an Indian Ladder that was crea<br/>ted for the
                    purpose thence down a <br/>
<pb facs="hv_swaynej_diary_1798_090" n="90"></pb> very steep hill to the water<br/>
                    and went up to the Cataract<br/> when the mist is continually fal<br/>ling, was
                    passed on a little farther<br/> until we got within the edge of the sheet<br/>
                    of water, at this time the wind vary<br/>ing a little blew some of the
                    water<br/> on us, it was a beautiful yet awful<br/> sight, we then ascended the
                    bank and<br/> went on foot to the <a href="/places/chipp1">Chippiway<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a>,
                    where we<br/> had left our horses, then rode 20 miles<br/> to an inn near the
                    outlet of the Lake.<br/> heard the roaring of <a href="/places/niagf">Niagara<placename key="niagf"></placename></a> very plain</p>
