<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                            <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> a <br/> chief of the

                    Brothers,</salute></opener>
<p> The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca"> Seneca <orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> nation see that the Great spirit
                    <br/> intends that they shall not continue to live by hunting, <br/> and they
                    look round on every side, and enquire who it <br/> is that shall teach them what
                    is best for them to do. <br/> Your Fathers have dealt fairly and honestly with
                    <br/> our Fathers, and they have charged us to remember <br/> it, and we think
                    it right to tell you, that we <br/> wish our children to be taught the same
                    principes <br/> by which your fathers were guided in their councils. </p>
<p> Brothers, <br/> We have too little wisdom among us: <br/> We cannot teach our
                    children what we perceive their <br/> situation requires them to know, and we
                    therefore <br/> ask you to instruct some of them We wish them to be <br/>
                    instructed to read and to write, and such other things <br/> as you teach your
                    children; and especially, to teach <br/> them to love peace. </p>
<p> Brothers, <br/> We desire of you to take under your <br/> care two <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca"> Seneca <orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> boys and teach them as your own; <br/> and,
                    in order that they may be satisfied to remain with <br/> you and be easy in
                    their minds, that you will take <br/> with them the son of our Interpreter and
                    teach him <br/> also according to his desire.</p>
<p>Brothers, <br/> You know that it is not in our power to <br/> pay<br/> <pb facs="SW_Letters_1791_02_10_Page_2" n="2"></pb>pay you
                    for the education of these three boys -- and therefore you <br/>must, if you do this
                    thing, look up to God for your reward.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You will consider of
                    this request, and let us <br/>know what you determine to do. If your hearts <br/>are
                    enclined toward us, and you will afford our nation <br/>this great advantage, I will
                    send my son as one of the <br/>boys to receive your instruction, and at the time
                    which <br/>you shall appoint.</p>
