<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his book, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                Preface 
                <p>The narrative and observations now pre-<br/> sented to the public, were the
                    fruits of a voyage<br/> undertaken solely with commercial views. They<br/> were
                    written without any expectation of their be-<br/> ing copied, and without the
                    remotest thought of<br/> publication. But falling accidentally under the<br/>
                    notice of the Editor, he was pleased with perusing<br/> them, and believed that,
                    if printed, they would<br/> also be agreeable to many others. He
                    accordingly<br/> communicated this idea to the writer, who, after<br/>
                    considering the subject, with a proper degree of<br/> modesty, consented to the
                    proposal. </p>
<p>If the reader should derive amusement or<br/> instruction from this work, he will
                    naturally wish<br/> to know something respecting the author. He is<br/> the
                    second son of the late Doctor Abraham Sutcliff,<br/> who practised, with much
                    skill and reputation, as<br/> a physician, in Sheffield, and who died there
                    about<br/> twelve years since. At Sheffield, the author, who<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_iv" n="iv"></pb>
                    was born and educated in the religious Society of<br/> Friends, served his
                    apprenticeship; and afterwards<br/> settled there in business as a merchant. In
                    this<br/> line he continued for several years, and dealt ex-<br/> tensively with
                    transatlantic connexions; which,<br/> after some time, rendered it expedient for
                    him to<br/> make two voyages to America, for the settlement<br/> of his affairs.
                    The latter voyage and the travels<br/> subsequent to it, comprise the
                    transactions which<br/> are now offered to the public. </p>
<p>In the year 1806, the author returned to<br/>
<a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, and continued there till the year
                    1811;<br/> when he conceived that a residence in America,<br/> might prove more
                    advantageous to him. He ac-<br/> cordingly, with his wife and one daughter, the
                    only<br/> surviving child of a very numerous family, em-<br/> barked for
                    New-York, in the sixth month last,<br/> with the view of settling in that
                    country. </p>
<p>Whilst the author was in America, he had<br/> frequent intervals of leisure,
                    which the nature of<br/> his mercantile concerns rendered unavoidable. Of<br/>
                    some of these opportunities he availed himself, to<br/> visit his connexions and
                    friends in various parts of<br/> the country; having also the view of gratifying
                    his<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_v" n="v"></pb> curiosity, and enlarging the sphere of his informa-<br/>
                    tion. Being a man of observation, of a strong<br/> memory and benevolent
                    disposition, and having<br/> formed an extensive acquaintance with
                    respectable<br/> persons in America, by whom he was treated with<br/> kindness
                    and attention; he seems to have been<br/> qualified to render an account of his
                    travels both<br/> pleasing and interesting. The Editor therefore<br/> ventures
                    to presume, that many of the remarks<br/> and occurrences contained in this
                    little volume,<br/> will prove useful as well as amusing to juvenile<br/>
                    readers; and that they will not be destitute of<br/> information to persons of
                    mature years. The<br/> narrative appears to be judicious, and is given<br/> with
                    great simplicity; and the Editor has not the<br/> least doubt of its strict
                    veracity. The anecdotes<br/> rise naturally from the subject, and are
                    generally<br/> of a curious, novel, and instructive nature. They<br/> are
                    numerous, and form a peculiar and striking<br/> feature of the work. On the
                    whole, the Editor<br/> persuades himself, that these travels will not be<br/>
                    unacceptable to the generality of readers. </p>

<p>After having taken leave of my relations and<br/> friends in <a href="/places/sheff">Sheffield<placename key="sheff"></placename></a>, I left home with my wife and<br/>
                    children. As our road lay through <a href="/places/castl">Castleton<placename key="castl"></placename></a>,
                    we<br/> visited <a href="/places/peaks">Peak's Hole<placename key="peaks"></placename></a>, which was a
                    great gratification<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_002" n="2"></pb>to the children, who had never before seen a natural<br/> curiosity
                    of equal interest. The habitations within<br/> the cavern, With the manufactory
                    of pack-thread<br/> that was carrying on there, had a very singular and<br/>
                    striking effect, which had something in it more like<br/> a dream or a vision,
                    than a transaction of real life.<br/> Yet I did not perceive on the countenances
                    of<br/> those who were employed in this subterraneous<br/> abode, less
                    appearance of being happy or cheerful,<br/> than we see upon the faces we meet
                    in the<br/> crowded streets of towns and cities:--Such is the<br/> force of
                    habit. </p>
<p>After taking some refreshment, we set out upon<br/> our next stage; and,
                    believing it would be some<br/> relief to the horses, I walked up the
                    Winyards,<br/> which, though a laborious walk, is far from being<br/> an
                    unpleasant one. This is, perhaps, one of the<br/> most romantic roads in this
                    country, on account of<br/> the steep and lofty mountains through which it<br/>
                    winds its way; and, after having ascended the<br/> summit, a very different
                    scenery is presented to<br/> the view: The most fruitful and populous part
                    of<br/> the counties of Lancaster and Chester lying in<br/> full prospect before
                    the eyes of the traveller, pre-<br/> sents something like the appearance of one
                    vast<br/> city intermixed with fields and woods. </p>
<p>In the evening, we arrived safe at <a href="/places/manch">Manchester<placename key="manch"></placename></a>.<br/> There we were hospitably entertained at the house<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_003" n="3"></pb> of T. H. jun. and were kindly shown through his<br/> bleaching,
                    dying, and printing works. We were<br/> also shown a beautiful collection of
                    dried speci-<br/> mens of herbs, flowers, &amp;c. the production of<br/> Botany
                    Bay. These he had received from an<br/> ingenious young man who had been
                    transported<br/> into that country when but a boy on a charge<br/> of pilfering;
                    of which, I understood, it was ge-<br/> nerallv believed he was innocent. His
                    habits of<br/> industry and care did not forsake him, although<br/> thrown
                    amongst such a set of companions as Botany<br/> Bay and a Transport Ship may be
                    supposed to<br/> furnish; and, in a few years, he had acquired<br/> property to
                    a considerable amount. </p>

<div type="entry">

<p> Having concluded to take our<br/> passage in one of the packet-boats which go
                    be-<br/> tween <a href="/places/manch">Manchester<placename key="manch"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/warri1">Warrington<placename key="warri1"></placename></a>, T. H. kindly<br/> accommodated us with
                    his sociable to the water-<br/> side. We got into the packet, and had a
                    pleasant<br/> sail nearly to <a href="/places/warri1">Warrington<placename key="warri1"></placename></a>,
                    where we dined, being<br/> about 18 miles. This is an easy mode of
                    travelling<br/> both as to expense and fatigue; and when upon a<br/> canal like
                    that of the Duke of Bridgewater's, and<br/> in such a country as that through
                    which we<br/> sailed this day, the weather at the same time being<br/> fine and
                    clear, it could scarcely be otherwise than<br/> very pleasant. In the evening we
                    arrived at<br/> Liverpool, and took up our quarters at our cousin<br/> T. B.'s.

                    Cousin A. B.'s, at <a href="/places/milee">Mile- end<placename key="milee"></placename></a>, near
                        <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>; where we had the company
                    of<br/> Captain R. B. of the Romulus, an agreeable, con-<br/> sistent friend,
                    from Hudson City, in the State of<br/> New-York. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-27">5th Month, 27th</date>. <placename key="liver"></placename></dateline>
<p>In the morning cousin T. B.<br/> kindly conducted me to the Lyceum; a
                    splendid<br/> public establishment of the nature of a news-room<br/> or
                    coffee-house, and library. Afterwards, accom-<br/> panied by my wife and
                    children, we paid a visit to<br/> the Asylum for the Blind ; an institution well
                    worthy<br/> the support of the wealthy, where many persons<br/> who have lost
                    their sight, are instructed in various<br/> branches of business, by which they
                    are enabled to<br/> pass their time usefully, and agreeably to them-<br/>
                    selves. After visiting this institution, we walked<br/> to the Botanic Garden.
                    Our relation being a sub-<br/> scriber, had the privilege of introducing us
                    as<br/> strangers; and we spent a pleasant hour or two,<br/> having, in the
                    compass of a few acres of land, an<br/> opportunity of seeing a vast variety of
                    plants, flowers,<br/> shrubs, and trees, natives of every quarter of the<br/>
                    world, alive and flourishing as in the countries<br/> from which they are
                    brought. Amongst them I<br/> noticed the banana and the sugar cane. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_005" n="5"></pb>
<p>After visiting these noble institutions, our feel-<br/> ings were harrowed by
                    seeing an unfeeling press-<br/> gang dragging along a friendless poor man,
                    whom<br/> they had just hunted down in the streets. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-28">5th Month 28th</date>. <placename key="liver"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day I paid a visit to<br/> Captain N. on board his ship called the
                    Laura;<br/> and after some conversation with him and his<br/> agent, J. C.
                    concluded to take my passage in her<br/> to New-York; for which I paid 35
                    guineas. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-29">5th Month, 29th</date>. <placename key="liver"></placename></dateline>
<p>In the afternoon of this day,<br/> I was requested by the Captain to be in
                    readiness<br/> to go on board in the evening; accordingly, after<br/> taking
                    leave of my wife, children, and hospitable<br/> relations, I went on board,
                    accompanied by my<br/> fellow-passengers, who were J. W. jun. and J. L.<br/>
                    both of Philadelphia; J. F. of Leeds, and W. W.<br/> of New Or1eans. After
                    sleeping that night on<br/> board, the wind proving contrary, and there
                    being<br/> no appearance of a change, we all came on shore<br/> in the morning,
                    and I returned to my wife and<br/> children. This was, I believe, an agreeable
                    disap-<br/> pointment to all of us, as the prospect of so long a<br/> voyage,
                    and the probability that we might never<br/> see each other more, on this side
                    the grave, had sat<br/> rather heavily upon some of our minds at parting<br/>
                    the evening before; and now, to have almost a<br/> certainty of spending another
                    day with my wife,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_006" n="6"></pb> children, and near relatives, seemed to me a privi-<br/> lege almost
                    invaluable. </p>

<p>I spent this day with my wife<br/> and children, in the family of my kind
                    relatives;<br/> and so pleasant it was to me, that it was like the<br/> addition
                    of one day to me being in the world. </p>

<div type="entry">

<p>This morning my wife and<br/> children, with part of cousin B.'s family, and<br/>
                    M. M. of Rochdale, accompanied me on board <br/>the Laura, then lying about a
                    mile from <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a><br/> near the Cheshire
                    shore. As our boat passed by<br/> the Princess, a ship of war, then lying in
                    the<br/> Mersey, we were a little entertained by the ship's<br/> crew being
                    ordered to man the rigging, just as we<br/> were along side of them. In a few
                    moments after<br/> the word of command was given, the shrouds of<br/> every mast
                    appeared covered with seamen, from the<br/> deck to the heads of the masts;
                    having the ap-<br/> pearance of three lofty pyramids; each beginning<br/> with a
                    file of men at the bottom, and finishing at<br/> the top with a single
                    individual. After spending<br/> about an hour, and taking some refreshment
                    on<br/> board the Laura, we all returned safe to <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>,<br/> where I slept this night. </p>

<p>The wind becoming<br/> more favorable, we received orders to be ready<br/> to go
                    on board again in the evening; so I again<br/> took leave of my wife and
                    children; but as I had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_007" n="7"></pb> before to return on shore, and the winds con-<br/> tinued variable,
                    there was a probability that I<br/> might have to return to them again in the
                    morn-<br/> ing. These circumstances took away a little of the<br/> edge of our
                    anxiety at parting, and rendered it not<br/> quite so formidable as our first
                    taking leave on the<br/> 29th ult. My cousin T. B. and W. B. accom-<br/> panied
                    us to the water-side, where a boat was<br/> waiting for us. We got safe to the
                    vessel, which<br/> lay at anchor the whole of this night. The next<br/> morning,
                    being <date when="1804-06-02">6th Month, 2d</date>, as the seamen<br/> were
                    raising the anchor, we were visited by R. B.<br/> who kindly came at six o'clock
                    in the morning<br/> to inquire after our welfare. What little wind<br/> we had
                    was favourable; and it being a clear and<br/> beautiful summer's day, the town
                    of <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>,<br/> and country on both sides
                    the Mersey, appeared<br/> to great advantage as we sailed down the river. </p>
<p>After passing a little way into the Irish Channel<br/> our Captain sent away the
                    Pilot. On the Pilot's<br/> leaving our ship, the captain requested that
                    when<br/> he got to his own vessel he would not present our<br/> seamen with a
                    bottle of spirits as was commonly<br/> done in such cases, alledging that his
                    men were<br/> already so intoxicated they were scarcely able<br/> to work the
                    ship. This circumstance, though<br/> seemingly of small importance, had nearly
                    been of<br/> serious consequence to us; and, for a time, there<br/> seemed some
                    danger of a mutiny amongst the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_008" n="8"></pb> men. Such was the sourness which it produced,<br/> that, during the
                    whole voyage, they sullenly re-<br/> fused the customary allowance from the
                    Captain,<br/> of a bottle of brandy at the end of every week;<br/> and, at one
                    time, a ring1eader in the business, who<br/> had formerly served on board a ship
                    of war,<br/> broke out into very abusive language to the Cap-<br/> tain, and
                    treated him in such a manner that there<br/> was some danger of the Captain
                    firing his pistol<br/> at him. I was sorry to find that this man had<br/> been
                    favoured with an education in our Society;<br/> and that his mother was a
                    valuable friend. Not-<br/> withstanding his bad conduct towards the
                    Captain,<br/> he always behaved with kindness and attention<br/> to me whenever
                    I came in his way and when I<br/> spoke to him, which I did several times,
                    endea-<br/> vouring to convince him of the impropriety of<br/> his conduct, in
                    thus doing his utmost to break in<br/> upon that subordination which was
                    necessary to<br/> be maintained in every ship. </p>
<p>After the pilot had left us, we proceeded along<br/> the Welch coast, having the
                    mountains of North<br/>
<a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a> in full view during the whole of the
                    day.<br/> The weather being calm and clear, it is scarcely<br/> in the power of
                    words to describe the gran-<br/> deur of the prospect, which indeed was
                    such<br/> that we could hardly regret the slow progress<br/> we made. In the
                    afternoon, when opposite one<br/> of the highest mountains, We were alarmed by<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_009" n="9"></pb> the noise of a very heavy discharge of cannon, from<br/> one or two
                    vessels which were some distance<br/> a-head of us. At first we supposed it to
                    be an<br/> engagement between an English and a French<br/> privateer; but, on
                    coming nearer, we had reason<br/> to believe they were two slave ships, which
                    had left<br/>
<a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a> a little before us, and had taken
                    the<br/> opportunity of scaling their great guns, and exer-<br/> cising their
                    men, when in a situation that would<br/> produce the greatest echo and noise; a
                    disposition<br/> very prevalent in the world. </p>
<p>The night coming on, the beautiful and romantic<br/> Welch scenery was hid from
                    us, and, next morning,<br/> having made but little progress during the
                    night,<br/> we found ourselves nearly opposite to <a href="/places/holyh">Holyhead<placename key="holyh"></placename></a>.<br/> Having been favoured with a smooth sea, we<br/>
                    escaped sickness, and sat down to breakfast with<br/> some appetite. Before we
                    rose from table, a ship<br/> that was coming up the <geogname key="chann">Channel</geogname>, put out her boat<br/> and made a signal to speak with
                    us. Our vessel<br/> was accordingly managed in a way to put them<br/> to as
                    little trouble as possible; and they soon<br/> reached us. On their coming on
                    board, we found the<br/> ship was the Liverpool, from <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/liver">Liver-
                    pool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>; and the Captain being an old acquaintance<br/> of the Master
                    of our ship, they were rejoiced to<br/> see each other. After an exchange of
                    intelligence<br/> and news papers, we parted from her, and sailed<br/> slowly
                    round the head of <a href="/places/holyh">Holy-head<placename key="holyh"></placename></a>, and soon had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_010" n="10"></pb> a fine prospect of <geogname key="caerb">Caernarvon Bay</geogname>;
                    but before the<br/> evening closed, the sky was overcast, and the wind<br/> got
                    up, so that we were under the necessity of<br/> taking in a great part of our
                    sails; and several of<br/> us began to be very sick. </p>
<p>In the course of the night, which was very dark,<br/> the wind became contrary;
                    and it was with great<br/> difficulty we got through the narrow part of the<br/>
<geogname key="chann">Channel</geogname>, near <a href="/places/stdav">St.
                        David's Head<placename key="stdav"></placename></a>, without fairly<br/> putting back towards
                        <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>. The passage<br/> was not
                    accomplished, without several times tack-<br/> ing from one coast to the other;
                    and, could I have<br/> had the management, I would gladly have put the<br/> ship
                    into <a href="/places/milfh">Milford Haven<placename key="milfh"></placename></a>, and did advise the
                    Captain<br/> to do it. However, we had cause to be thankful<br/> that we got
                    well out of this narrow sea, although<br/> not without imminent danger of losing
                    our cabin-<br/> boy, who was washed overboard as he was carry-<br/> ing the
                    knives and forks from the caboose to the<br/> cabin; but, in passing through the
                    railing, he got<br/> entangled among some ropes which hung from<br/> the rail,
                    and was thus providentially preserved.<br/> Nearly our whole stock of table
                    knives and forks<br/> were lost, which was a great inconveniency to us,<br/>
                    especially being just at the commencement of our<br/> voyage; however I did not
                    regret the loss of the<br/> knives and forks, seeing the boy's life was
                    preserved.<br/> This accident made so strong an impression upon<br/> the poor
                    lad, that he never recovered his spirits<br/> during the voyage. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_011" n="11"></pb>
<p>Our first mate being an active man, made us a<br/> few table forks from an old
                    barrel hoop, using the<br/> anchor as an anvil. These, with our pocket-<br/>
                    knives, served as a substitute for those we had lost.<br/> This little
                    occurrence manifests the propriety of<br/> passengers providing themselves each
                    with an<br/> extra knife and fork. </p>
<p>About two days after this, we got clear of both<br/> the English and Irish coast,
                    and made a rapid<br/> progress on our way across the Atlantic. There<br/> seemed
                    every probability of our being favoured<br/> with a short passage; but, in a
                    voyage at sea, as<br/> in the voyage of life, it often happens that our<br/>
                    prospects are not realized. </p>
<p>After about two weeks of fair wind in the gene-<br/> ral, we began to experience
                    hard gales, and from<br/> unfavourable quarters; so that for a week or ten<br/>
                    days, we made but little way. The patience of our<br/> Captain being a good deal
                    tried, and his temper<br/> somewhat soured, he was liable to use harsh lan-<br/>
                    guage to his people, and particularly to a black<br/> man who was steward of the
                    ship. On one occasion,<br/> the ship had laid to for several hours, not
                    being<br/> able to carry any sail, excepting a single one to<br/> steady her. In
                    this state she was left to drift be-<br/> fore the wind, which was then, to use
                    the Captain's<br/> expression, blowing a hurricane, and she was of<br/> course a
                    good deal agitated. The waves, according<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_012" n="12"></pb> to the seamen's phrase, were running mountains<br/> high. It
                    happened, under these circumstances, that<br/> one of the passengers, by a
                    sudden roll of the ves-<br/> sel, was near being thrown down the stairs into
                    the<br/> cabin; but, catching hold of the mahogany hand<br/> rail, he saved
                    himself at the expense of breaking<br/> the rail. This the Captain did not
                    observe till night<br/> when we were all seated in the cabin. Then<br/> he fell
                    upon the poor black man, with vio-<br/> lent and abusive language, charging him
                    with<br/> breaking the rail. After his passion was somewhat<br/> subsided, I
                    told him that I was a witness that the<br/> black man was innocent of what he
                    had charged<br/> him with; that, considering the kind of day we had<br/> passed
                    over, there was great cause to be thankful no<br/> other damage had been
                    sustained than the breaking<br/> of the hand rail, and that, so far from giving
                    way<br/> passion at trifling things in such a time as this, our<br/> minds ought
                    rather to be impressed with gratitude,<br/> that we had been providentially
                    preserved through<br/> the storm. </p>
<p>At first, the Captain seemed offended at my free-<br/> dom, and turned from me in
                    displeasure. Nothing<br/> more was said at that time; however, after we
                    were<br/> all in bed, and the passengers mostly asleep, he<br/> called to me,
                    and, on my answering him, he said,<br/> that he was convinced of the justice of
                    my obser-<br/> vations; was obliged to me for the hints I had<br/> dropped, and
                    that he was sorry for his having<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_013" n="13"></pb> given way to passion, when far other sentiments<br/> ought to have
                    possessed his mind. This acknow-<br/> ledgement was ingenuous on the part of the
                    Cap-<br/> tain; and I believe he slept no worse for it. </p>
<p>In the course of the day, when the weather had<br/> cleared up, altho' the wind
                    still blew very hard, and<br/> the waves were rolling along in awful
                    grandeur;<br/> while the ship was yet lying to and drifting before<br/> the
                    wind, the other passengers and myself went upon<br/> the upper part of the
                    quarter deck, that we might<br/> have a full view of the sea when thus agitated,
                    and<br/> appearing in all its majesty. There is something in<br/> such a scene
                    exceedingly humiliating. The most<br/> powerful of men, when thus baffled and
                    riding on<br/> the waves, every moment in danger of being swal-<br/> lowed up,
                    are indeed but <quote type="biblical">as the small dust of the<br/>
                        balance.</quote> Every sensible mind, when placed in<br/> situations like
                    these, must be alive to the senti-<br/> ment which that expression conveys. As
                    we thus<br/> stood admiring how every wave, after rolling<br/> along in majestic
                    greatness, seemed to break at<br/> our feet before it reached the ship, the
                    first mate,<br/> who was on the watch, called out aloud, for every<br/> one to
                    take care of himself. Observing that he ran<br/> and placed himself under the
                    quarter board, near<br/> one of the stansions, I immediately followed his<br/>
                    example, and, taking fast hold of the ropes, sat<br/> down by him; which I had
                    scarcely done before one<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_014" n="14"></pb> of these huge waves rolled completely over the ship;<br/> and we
                    were, for a short time, overwhelmed by it.<br/> Such was the force with which it
                    struck the ship,<br/> that she reeled to the other side, and really
                    trembled<br/> under the stroke. One of the passengers having his<br/> back
                    towards it, and not hearing the mate's warning,<br/> was struck down with so
                    much violence, and pre-<br/> cipitated to the other side of the vessel with so
                    much<br/> force, that his head, striking against one of the<br/> quarter boards,
                    broke the board in pieces; and a<br/> pair of cloth pantaloons which he held in
                    his hands<br/> at the time were washed overboard. Indeed we had<br/> great cause
                    to be thankful to Divine Providence, that<br/> we escaped without further loss
                    or damage; and it<br/> was matter of admiration to me, that, whilst buried<br/>
                    in the wave, my mind was preserved from any con-<br/> siderable fear or anxiety
                    as to the consequences. </p>
<p>At this time, we were, I believe, in the gulf<br/> stream; for as the water
                    passed over us, it felt as<br/> warm as new milk. The ship reeled so much
                    to<br/> one side, at the stroke of the sea, that we had a<br/> second immersion
                    as she righted, after recovering<br/> from the shock. As it had blown a hard
                    gale all<br/> the preceding night, the ocean was become so very<br/> rough
                    pretty early in the morning, that a heavy sea<br/> broke through the cabin
                    windows, and rolled into<br/> the beds on one side of the ship; which
                    occasioned<br/> a great alarm ; and I have seldom seen men rise<br/> more
                    quickly from their beds than our companions<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_015" n="15"></pb> did on that side of
                    the cabin. A little time after the<br/> storm had subsided, and the sea was
                    become calm,<br/> we were entertained with the sight of a number of<br/> flying
                    fish, which, from time to time, continued<br/> to rise our of the sea, and after
                    taking short flights,<br/> dropped again into the water. These flying fish
                    ap-<br/> peared to be pursued by a number of dolphins,<br/> which, for a
                    considerable time, kept company with<br/> the ship, so as to give us a full
                    opportunity of ob-<br/> serving their beautiful colours, continually
                    changing<br/> to the various tints of azure, green and gold. The<br/> gold
                    fishes, which we see confined in glass jars, are<br/> very beautiful; but not at
                    all to be compared with<br/> the dolphin, which is, besides a much larger
                    fish;<br/> generally weiging 8 or 10 pounds. Our seamen<br/> caught several of
                    them, and we found them very<br/> good eating. Although the colours of the
                    dolphin<br/> are exceedingly beautiful while alive and in motion<br/> in the
                    sea, yet they are still more extraordinary when<br/> the fish is taken out of
                    the water, and is in the<br/> agonies of death; Displaying then, every colour
                    of<br/> the rainbow, changing in rapid succession as long<br/> as life remains.
                    As the dolphins were in pursuit<br/> of the flying fish, so the dolphins in
                    their turn were<br/> pursued by the sharks; and such is the activity of<br/>
                    these voracious animals in seizing their prey, that,<br/> whilst one of our
                    people was dragging up a dolphin,<br/> as quickly as he possibly could, a huge
                    shark put up<br/> his monstrous jaws and snatched the fish from<br/> the hook. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_016" n="16"></pb>
<p>The voracious shark also had his enemies; for<br/> the sailors by throwing out
                    pieces of meat, enticed<br/> him to come so near the ship, that one of the
                    com-<br/> pany who stood upon the main-chains had an op-<br/> portunity of
                    casting the noose of a strong rope over<br/> his head; and the other end of the
                    rope being<br/> passed through a block, he was quickly hoisted upon<br/> deck,
                    where he lay some time striking the boards<br/> with his tail with great
                    violence. It was curious to<br/> see the agitation of the little pilot fishes,
                    which<br/> accompanied the shark; and when he was dragged<br/> out of the water,
                    they seemed to use their best<br/> endeavours to follow him. </p>
<p>The pilot fish is something like the mackerel;<br/> but of a smaller size. On the
                    shark's being thrown<br/> upon the deck, several sucking fish fell from him<br/>
                    about 8 or 10 inches in length. These fishes, I<br/> should suppose, are a
                    considerable annoyance to the<br/> shark, sticking close to various parts of his
                    body<br/> like a leech. The Captain not being willing that he<br/> should he
                    killed, on account of the dirt and disagree-<br/> able smell that he would make;
                    and the sailors not<br/> being willing that he should escape punishment,<br/>
                    wantonly tied a piece of wood about the size of a<br/> common oar to his tail,
                    and then hoisted him again<br/> and let him into the sea. Notwithstanding he
                    had<br/> been out of the water more than a quarter of an<br/> hour, the moment
                    he reached the sea, he dived<br/> into the deep with the incumbrance at his tail,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_017" n="17"></pb> apparently with the greatest ease, and was out of<br/> sight in a
                    few seconds. </p>
<p>Of the various kinds of fishes we saw on our pas-<br/> sage, porpoises were the
                    most common. They are<br/> large, weighing from 20 to 30 stone; yet we fre-<br/>
                    quently saw large shoals of them extending as far<br/> as the eye could reach,
                    and all driving along in<br/> one direction; frequently leaping quite out of
                    the<br/> water, and often passing close by the ship, so as to<br/> afford the
                    sailors an opportunity of striking them<br/> with the harpoon and dragging them
                    on board.<br/> Some of the people, I observed, were partial to<br/> the heart
                    and liver of this fish when fried, as-<br/> serting that they were scarcely to
                    be distinguished<br/> from those of a hog when dressed in the same<br/> way. At
                    one time we were entertained by the<br/> sight of several whales, five of which
                    passed close<br/> to the ship, sporting and rolling along within a<br/> few
                    yards of us; making a loud noise in snorting<br/> and spouting up the water from
                    a hole in their<br/> foreheads. These creatures were of large bulk,<br/> and
                    appeared exceedingly fat and sleek; their<br/> skins shining as if varnished. </p>
<p>Although there does not appear any place of<br/> rest for fowls in the wide
                    ocean, yet numbers of<br/> them are daily seen riding light pieces of cork
                    on<br/> the loftiest waves, and in the most tempestuous<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_018" n="18"></pb> weather. These are mostly of the petril tribe,<br/> although
                    sea-gulls are often seen at a great dis-<br/> tance from land, especially on the
                    banks of New-<br/> foundland and in approaching them. </p>
<p>In passing these banks it is wonderful to see the<br/> thick fog which generally
                    prevails, so that, in a morn-<br/> ing, the rigging and sails of the ship would
                    be drip-<br/> ping wet, as though they had been in heavy shower<br/> during the
                    night. In addition, the weather was so<br/> cold that it was very uncomfortable
                    to be without<br/> fire, although it was the middle of summer, and<br/> we were
                    many more degrees southward<br/> than <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>.
                    These heavy fogs when seen at a<br/> distance had many times much the appearance
                    of<br/> land; and about the time of the setting sun, they<br/> presented a great
                    variety of appearances. Some-<br/> times we might imagine we had the sight of
                    a<br/> splendid city, with towers, domes, and steeples,<br/> rising before us;
                    and, in a while, the whole would<br/> entirely vanish, and leave nothing to be
                    seen but<br/> the wide extended ocean, bounded by horizon. </p>
<p>Being detailed nearly two weeks in the gulf<br/> stream, by light and contrary
                    winds, our Captain<br/> began to be anxious about the provisions and water,<br/>
                    in consequence of which he put the men upon their<br/> allowance of beef and
                    pork, which were now<br/> handed to them by weight; and we ourselves were<br/>
                    prohibited the use of fresh water, in washing our<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_019" n="19"></pb> hands and faces, and were obliged to use the sea<br/> water which
                    is far from being pleasant. Besides,<br/> having had a considerable loss by the
                    breakage of<br/> ale and porter bottles, owing to their having been<br/> put up
                    when the liquor was new, the passengers<br/> and officers of the ship were
                    obliged to submit to<br/> a certain allowance of these articles; and we now<br/>
                    began to be more frugal of our fresh provisions<br/> than heretofore. </p>
<p>While our time was thus passing on in the gulf<br/> stream, we were under some
                    apprehensions of be-<br/> ing carried out of our course by the current; and<br/>
                    the sea being often as smooth as a fish-pond, we<br/> occasionally hoisted out
                    the boat, and taking an<br/> iron pot, let it down into the sea, by which
                    means<br/> the direction of the current was ascertained.<br/> Some of us were at
                    the trouble of sealing up a<br/> bottle, inclosing a paper containing the
                    latitude<br/> and longitude; and, adding our names and places<br/> of abode, We
                    requested that the person who<br/> might pick it up would inform any of the
                    parties.<br/> Although we had no great expectation of hearing<br/> more of the
                    bottle after it was thrown into the<br/> sea, yet I had not been long in America
                    before<br/> the paper was handed to me, having been picked<br/> up on the sands
                    near <a href="/places/newpo">Newport<placename key="newpo"></placename></a>, in Rhode Island.<br/> Thus,
                    contrary to the received opinion respecting<br/> the current of the gulf stream,
                    it had been carried<br/> in a north-westerly direction. There seemed no<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_020" n="20"></pb> of accounting for this circumstance, but by<br/> supposing that the
                    action of the wind had made<br/> the bottle deviate from the course of the
                    stream. </p>
<p>Having considerable time on our hands, we<br/> amused ourselves in little
                    experiments of this sort.<br/> Several times we sunk well-corked empty
                    bottles<br/> to a considerable depth into the sea; and although<br/> great care
                    was taken to have the corks tight and<br/> sealed, yet it was invariably the
                    case, when drawn<br/> up again, that the corks were found pushed into<br/> the
                    bottles, or that the bottles had filled with water<br/> by its passing through
                    the pores of the cork. I have<br/> already observed that the water in the gulf
                    stream<br/> was warm as new milk; but on sinking a ther-<br/> mometer some depth
                    in the sea, and hastily draw-<br/> ing it up again, we found that the water
                    below<br/> was as cold as in any other part. </p>
<p>After a tedious time spent in the gulf stream, we<br/> at length arrived on the
                    coast of North America;<br/> and on 1st day morning, <date when="1804-07-29">the
                        29th of the 7th Month</date>,<br/> we were favoured with the sight of Long
                    Island.<br/> A little after noon, we ran close in shore, so much<br/> so that
                    the ship was hastily put about, or she<br/> would have touched the bottom in a
                    few minutes;<br/> for, in turning round, she raked up the mud<br/> so much as to
                    discolour the water to a con-<br/> siderable degree; however we were soon in
                    deep<br/> water again. Thus, after having been for 8 weeks<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_021" n="21"></pb> at sea, where the eye had been almost wearied<br/> with a continued
                    sameness of prospects, and after<br/> having had, for several hours, the
                    delightful pro-<br/> spect of farm-houses and plantations, we again<br/>
                    launched into the wide ocean. To be thus<br/> snatched from green fields and
                    woods, and cheer-<br/> ful habitations, was a trial of patience to some of<br/>
                    our companions; and, all the afternoon, I noticed<br/> an anxious looking
                    towards the land, in most of us. </p>
<p>The next morning, about four o'clock, <date when="1804-07-30">7th<br/> Month,
                        30th</date>, I was waked by the report of a<br/> great gun, which was
                    followed by considerable<br/> bustle upon deck. After getting up, I
                    understood<br/> that a shot had been fired over us by an English<br/> frigate,
                    called the Boston, which, in company with<br/> the Leander and Cambrian men of
                    war, and Driver<br/> sloop of war, was then cruizing near us; and<br/> as the
                    cannon-ball that was fired over us, was an<br/> earnest of what we might expect
                    if we did not<br/> stop to receive an officer from the frigate, the<br/>
                    topsails were immediately backed, and we short-<br/> ened sail that they might
                    have an opportunity of<br/> coming to us. A Lieutenant and Midshipman<br/> were
                    sent on board. After spending about half<br/> an hour in conversation with us,
                    and exchanging<br/> intelligence and newspapers, they left the ship;<br/> and,
                    at parting, observed that they believed all our<br/> seamen were citizens of the
                    United States, and<br/> therefore did not wish to examine them; but<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_022" n="22"></pb> that they hoped we would not hoist our sails until<br/> we had a
                    signal from the frigate; which was com-<br/> plied with. </p>
<p>We were now again in sight of land, being near<br/>
<a href="/places/sandyh">Sandyhook<placename key="sandyh"></placename></a>. Having a fine view of the
                        <geogname key="jersm">Jersey<br/> Mountains</geogname>, and it being a clear
                    summer's morn-<br/> ing, the country before us appeared exceedingly<br/>
                    beautiful. In approaching the shore we observed<br/> an appearance not less
                    beautiful in what I believe<br/> is called a land-loom. The whole country
                    ap-<br/> peared to be reflected in the atmosphere; some-<br/> thing like what we
                    see from the banks of rivers,<br/> when objects are reflected in the water.
                    But<br/> here, instead of the images appearing in the water<br/> united at
                    bottom to the objects, they were all re-<br/> flected in the air, with their
                    tops downwards; and<br/> each reflection seeming to touch the <emph rend="italic">top</emph> of the<br/> object reflected. </p>
<p>The different ships of war, which I have just<br/> mentioned, made a very gay
                    appearance; for<br/> the weather being fine and clear, and but little<br/> wind,
                    they had most of their sails spread, and<br/> continued sailing to and fro
                    before <a href="/places/sandyh">Sandyhook<placename key="sandyh"></placename></a>;<br/> the <geogname key="never">Never-sink Mountains</geogname> being in the back<br/> ground.
                    Their object was to watch two French<br/> frigates then lying in <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, as the Lieutenant<br/> of the Boston
                    informed us, and, at the same time,<br/> to examine all American ships in order
                    to discover<br/> if there were any of the subjects of Great Britain<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_023" n="23"></pb> serving on board, with a view to impress them.<br/> It appeared to
                    be an arduous and delicate situa-<br/> tion in which the Commander of these
                    ships was<br/> placed. Having to fulfil the orders of his Govern-<br/> ment on
                    the one hand, and being in danger of<br/> giving offence to the America on the
                    other, it<br/> seemed impossible for him to steer clear, unless<br/> possessed
                    of a very uncommon share of prudence<br/> and discretion. </p>
<p>In sailing up to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, we passed by
                    the<br/> two French frigates, called the Didon and the the<br/> Sybille. They
                    appeared to be very full of men.<br/> Soon after four o'clock in the afternoon,
                    we ar-<br/> rived at that city; and coming along-side the<br/> wharf, we were
                    handed on shore by J. W. who<br/> kindly conducted us to our quarters, and we
                    were<br/> soon after joined by A. B. who drank tea and<br/> spent the evening
                    with us. Thus, after a passage<br/> of 58 days, we were favoured to land safe
                    in<br/> America, for which we have abundant cause to be<br/> thankful. In
                    passing through the streets to our<br/> lodgings, I was struck with the great
                    variety<br/> of fruit exposed for sale; such as pine-apples,<br/> melons of
                    various kinds, peaches, &amp;c. &amp;c. Me-<br/> lons and pine-apples I bought
                    for 3d. or 4d. each,<br/> and other fruit in proportion. On going to bed<br/>
                    this evening, I found that after being so long<br/> habituated to the motion of
                    the ship, I could<br/> get scarcely any sleep. </p>

<p>This morning I was<br/> conducted by my companions to one of the Public<br/>
                    Baths kept in the <a href="/places/nycit">city of New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.
                    These<br/> Baths are upon a plan I had not seen before. On<br/> each side of a
                    long and spacious passage, is a<br/> range of small rooms, in each of which is a
                    Bath<br/> sufficient to accommodate one person; with suit-<br/> able
                    conveniences for dressing and undressing. On<br/> the side of each Bath are two
                    brass cocks, the<br/> one furnishing warm and the other cold water; so<br/> that
                    the bather may have the water at what tem-<br/> perature he pleases. There is
                    also a valve, by<br/> means of which, if there is more water than is<br/>
                    pleasant, he may let part of it out. Some of these<br/> Baths are made of white
                    marble; and are so con-<br/> structed that a person may lie down or sit in
                    them.<br/> So grateful it is to remain a considerable time in<br/> them, in the
                    warm season of the year, that it<br/> is a common practice for bathers to take
                    books<br/> with them to read while they thus indulge them-<br/> selves in the
                    Bath. There are also Baths in a<br/> different part of the house set apart for
                    females. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_025" n="25"></pb>
<p>After spending a little time at the Bath, we re-<br/> turned to breakfast. On
                    sitting down to it, I<br/> could not avoid noticing the difference there
                    was<br/> betwixt an American and an English breakfast<br/> table; and I took out
                    my pencil and put down the<br/> different articles that were on the table before
                    me,<br/> which were intended for four persons only. The<br/> articles were as
                    follows:-coffee and tea, with rolls,<br/> and bread and butter, broiled fish,
                    and cutlets,<br/> hung beef, boiled eggs, a small species of lobster,<br/>
                    radishes, and blackberries. The butter brought<br/> upon the table, had a piece
                    of ice placed upon it,<br/> which is a general practice in this country,
                    during<br/> the summer. This keeps the butter as cool and<br/> hard as in
                    winter. Most of this day was spent in<br/> passing our luggage through the
                    custom-house;<br/> and, it is but justice to the revenue officers in<br/> this
                    country to notice, that they are very obliging<br/> in their behaviour; and,
                    being allowed handsome<br/> salaries, they are not in the practice of
                    taking<br/> fees or bribes. </p>

<p>Being invited by <a href="/people/fthom1">F. T.<persname key="fthom1"></persname></a> I ac-<br/> companied him
                    to his country-house, about two<br/> miles above <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, on the <geogname key="eastr">East River</geogname>,
                    where<br/> I spent the evening and slept. Being in the heat<br/> of summer, and
                    near the tide waters, I was con-<br/> siderably annoyed with musquitoes. I
                    returned<br/> with F. T. to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> the next
                    morning, and,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_026" n="26"></pb> after attending <a href="/organizations/nymm">the monthly meeting
                        there<orgname key="nymm"></orgname></a>, dined<br/> at J. B.'s. The next day I set out in the<br/>
                    mail stage for <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, in company
                    with<br/> J. L. and J. F. On our way, we dined at <a href="/places/newar">Newark<placename key="newar"></placename></a>,<br/> at Archibald Gifford's Tavern, and reached<br/>
<a href="/places/prince">Prince Town<placename key="prince"></placename></a> to supper. The country we
                    passed<br/> through was pleasantly diversified with hill and<br/> dale; and the
                    luxuriant appearance of the fields<br/> of Indian corn, had a very striking
                    effect upon one<br/> who had not been much out of England. The<br/> situations
                    and appearances of <a href="/places/newar">Newark<placename key="newar"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/prince">Prince Town<placename key="prince"></placename></a>, are particularly beautiful. But
                    it was<br/> quite dark before we reached <a href="/places/trent">Trenton<placename key="trent"></placename></a>, so that our<br/> coachman was unable to see his way,
                    in driving<br/> into the ferryboat; and the wheels on one<br/> side of the
                    carriage passing into the boat whilst<br/> those on the other side went into
                        <geogname key="delaw">the Delaware</geogname>, we<br/> narrowly escaped a
                    plunge into the water. The<br/> passengers usually keep their seats in the
                    carriage<br/> while it is ferried over the rivers in this country;<br/> and, in
                    general, the horses are so well trained, that<br/> they are driven in and out of
                    the boats without<br/> any difficulty. On finding ourselves in this
                    perilous<br/> situation, we all got out of the carriage into the<br/> boat as
                    well as we could; which was no very easy<br/> task, as it was quite dark, and we
                    were without<br/> lamp or candle. The driver putting back his<br/> horses, got
                    clear of the boat, and in his second<br/> attempt drove fairly into it, and we
                    crossed the<br/> river without further accident. </p>

<p>The next morning, the <date when="1804-08-04">4th of 8th Month</date>, we<br/>
                    got safe to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> to breakfast. Here
                    I<br/> met with my brother J. S. and cousin T. W. whom<br/> I accompanied to S.
                    B's, in Arch-street, where<br/> I took up my lodgings. The streets of
                    Philadel-<br/> phia all run parallel, or cross each other at right<br/> angles,
                    and many of them are planted with a row<br/> of trees on each side. In walking
                    along them, I<br/> was a good deal entertained with the loud, and<br/> almost
                    incessant chirping which is heard from the<br/> trees in the evening, after
                    sunset; and which I un-<br/> derstood was chiefly occasioned by the tree
                    frog.<br/> This species of frog makes its abode amongst the<br/> branches of the
                    trees, and' makes a very considera-<br/> ble noise in the evening. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline>On the <date when="1804-08-06">6th of the 8th Month</date>, <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I attended the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/pqm">quarterly meeting for Philadelphia<orgname key="pqm"></orgname></a>, which,
                    though<br/> one of the largest in America, did not continue<br/> more than one
                    hour and a half, there being but<br/> little business before it, besides
                    answering the<br/> queries. As this was likely to be a very abundant<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_028" n="28"></pb> fruit year, and many friends had large orchards,<br/> some
                    individuals very pressingly cautioned them<br/> against suffering their cider to
                    be distilled. The<br/> concern of friends, in this country, against the
                    fre-<br/> quent use of spirituous liquors in their families, is<br/> very great;
                    and probably it is not without just<br/> cause. The trouble attendant on brewing
                    and pre-<br/> serving malt liquor in warm climates is great; and,<br/> on the
                    contrary, spirituous liquors are preserved<br/> with so little difficulty, in so
                    little room, and at so<br/> easy an expense, that most families, especially
                    in<br/> the country, give them the preference as com-<br/> mon beverage
                    throughout the year, when diluted<br/> with water. It is not from cider alone
                    they pro-<br/> cure spirits. Large quantities are also distilled<br/> from the
                    juice of peaches. This is called peach<br/> brandy, and possesses a peculiar
                    flavour and colour,<br/> obtained from the kernels. The general price of<br/>
                    brandies of these kinds is about 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d.<br/> sterling per gallon;
                    and these are, when kept an<br/> equal age, but little inferior to French
                    brandy.<br/> After the quarterly meeting, I dined with T. S.'s<br/> family,
                    being invited by him; and, after dinner,<br/> took a walk with him through his
                    tan-yard. I ob-<br/> served that they did not confine themselves to oak<br/>
                    bark; but made use of bark from other trees also,<br/> the particular kinds of
                    which I do not recollect;<br/> but I think a species of pine, and the walnut
                    are<br/> of the number. </p>

<p>In the afternoon I accom-<br/> panied some friends to take a view of the
                    skeleton<br/> of a Mammoth, which was carefully put together<br/> and set up in
                    a convenient room in the city. When<br/> clothed with flesh, this animal must
                    have been of<br/> enormous bulk. The tusks were upwards of six<br/> feet in
                    length, and the leg bones appeared about<br/> the thickness of the waist of a
                    middle sized person.<br/> In comparing the bones of this animal with those<br/>
                    of an elephant, a considerable difference is observed,<br/> particularly about
                    the feet; those of the Mammoth<br/> resembling the feet of a beast of prey more
                    than the<br/> elephant, appearing to be armed with sharp claws.<br/> One of the
                    claws, about eight inches in length, which<br/> was found near the skeleton, I
                    had in my hands.<br/> An animal of such bulk, so armed, must have been<br/> very
                    destructive to the creatures around him. The<br/> Indians have a tradition, that
                    on this account the<br/> Great Spirit directed that the whole species
                    should<br/> become extinct. Near the banks of the large<br/> rivers in this
                    country, and generally near the salt<br/> springs, the bones of these animals
                    are found. In<br/> the inland parts of America all kinds of cattle are<br/>
                    excessively fond of salt, and, as in other parts of<br/> the world, there are
                    here many springs whose<br/> waters are brackish. Contiguous to these
                    springs,<br/> the clay and earth, over which the waters have<br/> run, are
                    impregnated with salt; and to these<br/> places, all kinds of wild cattle
                    frequently resort,<br/> and are seen licking the earth with great eagerness.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_030" n="30"></pb> These places are called Salt Licks, by the inhabi-<br/> tants, and,
                    on the banks of the Ohio, is a place of<br/> this sort, called the Bigbone Lick,
                    on account of<br/> the great number of Mammoth bones which are<br/> found buried
                    in its vicinity. From this it seems as<br/> if these enormous creatures
                    stationed themselves<br/> near the salt springs, that they might make a
                    prey<br/> of the animals which resorted to them; and, it is<br/> very probable,
                    that the old Mammoths, in particu-<br/> lar, might station themselves in places
                    like these,<br/> where, at last, they would die of old age. </p>

<dateline>The <date when="1804-08-09">8th and 9th</date>
<placename key="norrist"></placename></dateline>
<p>were spent in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.<br/> The next day,
                    accompanied by my brother J. S.<br/> and T. W. I paid a visit to a relation at
                    his estate<br/> above <a href="/places/norrist">Norristown<placename key="norrist"></placename></a>, being
                    about twenty miles from<br/> Philadelphia. This plantation, consists of 300<br/>
                    acres of good land, 200 of which are cleared,<br/> and 100 covered with wood.
                    The wood land is<br/> the most valuable, being so convenient for the<br/>
                    Philadelphia carpenters, &amp;c. On the estate is a<br/> well finished square
                    stone house, about 15 yards in<br/> length, with a wide boarded floor piazza,
                    both in<br/> back and front. These afford excellent accom-<br/> modation during
                    the summer season, which con-<br/> tinues much longer, and in general is much
                    warmer<br/> here than in England; as, in these piazzas, they<br/> frequently
                    take tea and spend their evenings.<br/> Besides the dwelling-house there is an
                    excellent<br/> kitchen, and offices adjoining; with a large barn,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_031" n="31"></pb> and stables sufficient to accommodate 40 horses<br/> and cows; all
                    well built of stone. The estate<br/> extends the whole breadth betwixt the
                        <geogname key="schri">Schuilkill</geogname><br/> and <geogname key="perkri">Perkiomen</geogname>. On the former river there is a<br/> Shad Fishery
                    which is of considerable value; and,<br/> if prosecuted with spirit, might
                    supply many fa-<br/> milies with fish for the whole year. The house is<br/> so
                    situated that it commands one of the finest pro-<br/> spects in Pennsylvania,
                    and, being on a rising ground,<br/> is dry and healthy. The whole together
                    forms<br/> one of the most beautiful spots I have seen in the<br/> United
                    States. This estate, with all its appendages,<br/> cost about 3600l. sterling,
                    which is but 12l. per<br/> acre, the buildings included. There is also an
                    ex-<br/> cellent orchard of about 10 acres planted with the<br/> choicest
                    fruit-trees, which are just in their prime. </p>
<p>This plantation was formerly in the possession<br/> of a friend from London, of
                    the name of Vaux,<br/> who built the house and made the improvements<br/> upon
                    it. When he resided there with his family,<br/> during the American war, being
                    in full view of<br/> the great American encampment at <a href="/places/vallf">Valley Forge<placename key="vallf"></placename></a>,<br/> and on the opposite side of the <geogname key="schri">river Schuilkill</geogname>,<br/> he had frequently the company
                    of General Howe,<br/> and the other British Commanders. One day it<br/> happened
                    that he had Howe to breakfast and<br/> Washington to tea; and being a friend who
                    wished<br/> well to all men, he made no distinction between<br/> the contending
                    parties, he left his house open to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_032" n="32"></pb> all. This was the general practice of friends dur-<br/> ing the
                    war, particularly with those who stood<br/> true to the principles of their
                    profession: and this<br/> proved the best policy; for though attended with<br/>
                    some loss of provisions at the time, yet they were<br/> generally preserved from
                    any serious suffering in<br/> their persons, by their hospitable conduct. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-08-12">8th Month, 12th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>This being the 1st day of the<br/> week, our relation conducted us to <a href="/organizations/meetprov">Providence meeting<orgname key="meetprov"></orgname></a>, a few miles distant from
                    his house. After<br/> meeting we were kindly invited to dinner, by a<br/> friend
                    who was a stranger to us. We felt and<br/> acknowledged his kindness, but
                    returned with our<br/> relation, in whose family we spent the remainder<br/> of
                    the day. Notwithstanding this was the hottest<br/> season of the year, we had a
                    very liberal supply of<br/> ice upon the table; which I found my relation
                    had<br/> the means of procuring without trouble or expence<br/> to himself.
                    Amongst the buildings in his purchase<br/> was an ice-house, which every winter
                    is replenished<br/> by some of his neighbours, for the privilege<br/> of
                    supplying themselves in the summer. I noticed<br/> that the two female servants
                    employed in the fa-<br/> mily, had, both of them, been lately hired from on<br/>
                    board a vessel lying in the Delaware; and which<br/> had recently arrived from
                    Amsterdam with several<br/> hundred Germans, men, women, and children, of<br/>
                    that description of people called, in America, Re-<br/> demptioners. These are
                    people in low circum-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_033" n="33"></pb>stances, who, being desirous of settling in America,<br/> and not
                    having money to pay their passage, agree<br/> with the American captains of
                    vessels to be taken<br/> over on condition of hiring for a term of years,
                    on<br/> their arrival in America, to masters who are willing<br/> to advance 10
                    or 12 guineas to be deducted out of<br/> their wages; and it not unfrequently
                    happens that<br/> they agree to serve two, three, or four years for<br/> meat
                    and clothes only, on condition of their pas-<br/> sage being paid. Yet, as
                    wages, in the general,<br/> are rather high in America, it will easily be
                    sup-<br/> posed that an active and clever person, conversant in<br/> some
                    business, will make much better terms on<br/> landing, than the old and infirm;
                    or than those who<br/> come over ignorant of any business. </p>
<p>The two female servants I have just mentioned<br/> were both widows; and one of
                    them had two chil-<br/> dren with her in the family, who were quite young.<br/>
                    This woman had lost her husband about the time<br/> of their arrival on the
                    American coast; and the<br/> husband of the other, being a sea-faring man
                    be-<br/> longing to Holland, had, as I understood, lost<br/> his life and
                    property by an English ship of war.<br/> Although these two females had obtained
                    a settle-<br/> ment in a country enjoying many privileges beyond<br/> that which
                    they had left; yet, I think, no feeling<br/> mind could behold them thus
                    circumstanced,<br/> placed amongst strangers of whose language they<br/> were
                    almost wholly ignorant; and habituated to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_034" n="34"></pb> customs very different from those to which they<br/> had now to
                    conform, without sensations of com-<br/> passion; and it was very pleasant to me
                    to<br/> observe that the general deportment of my rela-<br/> tions towards them
                    was respectful. </p>
<p>I noticed many families, particularly in <a href="/places/penns">Penn-
                        sylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, of great respectability both in our<br/> Society and
                    amongst others, who had themselves<br/> come over to this country as
                    Redemptioners; or<br/> were the children of such. And it is remarkable,<br/>
                    that the German residents in this country, have<br/> a character for greater
                    industry and stability than<br/> those of any other nation. </p>
<p>In the plantation adjoining my relation's, we<br/> visited a lead mine on the
                    banks of the <geogname key="perkri">Perkio-<br/>men</geogname>, which was then
                    worked by a Frenchman. He<br/> invited us to go down into it, where, at the
                    depth<br/> of about 12 feet, I saw a vein of lead ore 18 inches<br/> in
                    thickness; and as it is wrought at a very easy<br/> expense, there was a great
                    probability of its being<br/> a very valuable acquisition. But these things,
                    like<br/> many others in the world, have the stamp of great<br/> uncertainty
                    upon them. </p>

<p>We returned this day to<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. In our way, we stopped at the
                        <a href="/places/buckt">Buck Tavern<placename key="buckt"></placename></a>, where we supped and
                    breakfasted. After<br/> breakfast we crossed the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname>, at <a href="/places/sprmill">Spring Mill
<placename key="sprmill"></placename></a>, and had a sight of a vineyard of about five
                    <br/>acres, under the management of a Frenchman.<br/> As the vines were not
                    suffered to grow more than<br/> three feet in height, it had something the
                    appear-<br/> ance of a field of raspberries. By the pruning<br/> down the vines,
                    the fruit, generally, becomes much<br/> finer than when suffered to spread, as
                    is commonly<br/> the case in England. This day the thermometer<br/> stood at 76,
                    in the shade, at two o'clock in the<br/> afternoon. I believe that we have
                    sometimes as<br/> hot days in England, during the summer months,<br/> as are
                    commonly felt in America; but there be-<br/> ing a much longer continuance of
                    hot weather<br/> in the latter country, it is, of course, more fa-<br/> vourable
                    for ripening various kinds of fruit.<br/> Having been very kindly invited, I
                    dined at<br/> E. L's, the father of one of our companions on<br/> the voyage
                    from Liverpool. The generous atten-<br/> tions I experienced in this family, I
                    trust I shall<br/> not soon forget. On sitting down to dinner, I<br/> found
                    myself in company with three other English-<br/> men, whom this kind family had
                    also invited: they<br/> were J. S. of Manchester; J. N. of Wakefield;<br/> and
                    J. F. of Leeds. </p>

<p>Spent part of this day at<br/> J. W.'s, where I had the company of H. J. and<br/>
                    M. R. The lively and cheerful flow of <a href="/people/rjone1">R. J.<persname key="rjone1"></persname></a>'s
                    spirits<br/> remains with her in her old age; no doubt, in a great<br/> measure,
                    the result of a well-spent life; and she<br/> enjoys, in a remarkable degree,
                    the love and esteem<br/> of her neighbours and friends. In the evening I<br/>
                    called on Wm. Savery's widow, who appeared to<br/> be dejected, on account of
                    the recent loss of a<br/> beloved husband. Few men have finished their<br/>
                    course, in the possession of more esteem and regard<br/> from mankind in
                    general; and his mind dwelling<br/> near to the mountain of Life and Love, his
                    charity<br/> was unbounded. Exclusive of the testimony of<br/> the meeting to
                    which he belonged, I noticed a<br/> number of tributes to his memory, in a
                    variety of<br/> periodical publications, both in prose and verse. </p>

<p>Spent a pleasant evening at<br/>
<a href="/people/dbaco1">D. Bacon<persname key="dbaco1"></persname></a>'s. He, like the last mentioned
                    friend,<br/> was a man highly esteemed in the circle of his<br/> acquaintance;
                    and, being of a sweet disposition,<br/> had a great place amongst young friends,

                        Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>'s, a kind and<br/> hospitable friend of this meeting.
                    Although<br/> approaching to his 90th year, he was then of<br/> considerable
                    activity in offices of kindness to his<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_037" n="37"></pb> friends. Having lived nearly all his time in this<br/> city, he has
                    had the opportunity of observing its<br/> regular, although rapid progress, from
                    a small<br/> town to a great commercial city. Amongst<br/> other things, he
                    mentioned to me that he well<br/> remembered the time when there was but
                    one<br/> ironmonger's shop in the place; and when there<br/> was only one ship
                    in the trade between Philadel-<br/> phia and London; and the arrival of this
                    vessel<br/> used to be of so much importance, that marriages<br/> were sometimes
                    delayed until its return. Such is<br/> the great increase of this city, that it
                    is now said<br/> to contain 106,000 inhabitants; more than 1000<br/> families of
                    whom are of our society. </p>

<p>I set out for New-York in<br/> the packet-boat, by way of <a href="/places/burli">Burlington<placename key="burli"></placename></a>, and had a<br/> pleasant sail up <geogname key="delaw">the Delaware</geogname>, being about 20<br/> miles. The fare I
                    paid was 13 1/2 pence to Burlington.<br/> The next day I attended <a href="/organizations/meetburl">Burlington meeting<orgname key="meetburl"></orgname></a>, and<br/> on the <date when="1804-08-24">24th</date>, set out in the public stage for Am-<br/> boy,
                    passing through a great part of West Jersey.<br/> In our way we breakfasted at
                        <a href="/places/crosw">Croswick's<placename key="crosw"></placename></a>, where I<br/> noticed a noble

                    grounds<br/> about them, all in neat order. This night I lodged<br/> at the inn

                    in the dead of the night,<br/> in the summer season, in America. Its song is

<p>This morning I went on<br/> board the packet for <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and in the passage<br/> we passed by the Romulus,
                    Capt. R. B. from Liver-<br/> pool. By this vessel I had the pleasure of
                    receiv-<br/> ing letters from my friends in England, and also<br/> agreeable
                    accounts of my wife and children, who<br/> were at Liverpool when she left that
                    port. </p>
<p>I staid at <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> till after the <date when="1804-09-11">11th of the 9th<br/> month</date>. In this city I once
                    dined at the house of<br/> --, in company with several English friends.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_039" n="39"></pb> This individual is a remarkable instance of the<br/> instability of
                    human things. A very short time<br/> since he was one of the most wealthy
                    merchants<br/> in this city, and stood high in the estimation of<br/> friends,
                    and that deservedly. By the Indians who<br/> visited New-York, he was looked up
                    to as a father;<br/> and his house was always open to them. When<br/> by a
                    sudden reverse, arising from circumstances<br/> which he could not controul, his
                    property was<br/> dissipated and lost. </p>

<p>were employed in busi-<br/> ness. One day, in passing along the streets, I
                    was<br/> entertained with the sight of two Indian young<br/> men, with each a
                    bow and arrow in his hand, trip-<br/> ping nimbly along, like two wild animals
                    yet un-<br/> broken to the yoke. I also attended the sale of a<br/> forge and
                    saw mill, with four dwelling-houses, and<br/> 50 acres of land, distant 40 miles
                    from New-<br/> York, and 10 miles from <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson's
                        River</geogname>. The<br/> whole sold for 270l. sterling. Before I left

<p>I left <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, and, in the<br/> evening,
                    came to <a href="/places/wash">Washington City<placename key="wash"></placename></a>; or rather to<br/> the
                    scite on which the Metropolis of the United<br/> States is intended to be built;
                    for, as yet, little is<br/> done towards the foundation of a city,
                    excepting<br/> the public offices, and houses for the accommoda-<br/> tion of
                    the officers and clerks in the various de-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_041" n="41"></pb>partments of the State, and a few inns and taverns;<br/> but, as
                    George Town is adjoining to it, they to-<br/> gether make up a population of
                    about 8000 inha-<br/> bitants. The capitol will be a noble building<br/> when
                    finished; and is beautifully situated on a<br/> commanding eminence; whence
                    every part of the<br/> city may be seen; and whence also is a fine pro-<br/>
                    spect of the Navy Yard, and of the Potowmack as<br/> far down as Alexandria;
                    being a distance of 6 or<br/> 7 miles. Upon the whole, the situation is one
                    of<br/> the most eligible spots for a city that I have ever<br/> seen; and the
                    plan being deliberately drawn out,<br/> and every thing done with regularity and
                    order, it<br/> bids fair at some future day, to be one of the<br/> most elegant
                    and regularly built cities in the world;<br/> and, what is of more consequence,
                    the situation is<br/> dry and healthy. To a contemplative mind, there<br/> is
                    something very interesting in the consideration<br/> of the representatives of
                    an extensive empire, like<br/> that of the United States, thus jointly
                    fixing<br/> upon the most eligible situation for their chief<br/> city. </p>
<p>After taking tea at <a href="/places/geort">George Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, I crossed the<br/>
<geogname key="potor">Potowmack</geogname>, and went down that evening to<br/>
<a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, a beautiful little city, situated
                    on that<br/> river, at a spot where it is about one mile over,<br/> and so deep
                    that ships of war ride at anchor<br/> before the town. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_042" n="42"></pb>
<p>A worthy friend, of this city, mentioned to me<br/> a remarkable preservation
                    experienced there during<br/> the war. While the town was in the hands of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/usag">American Government<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>, the English Commander
                    had,<br/> for some reason, given orders to burn it; and a ship<br/> of war,
                    containing every requisite for its destruction,<br/> was ordered up the
                    Potowmack. This inhabitants,<br/> as well may be conceived, were in the utmost
                    con-<br/> sternation; but, at the moment when they were in<br/> the greatest
                    confusion and distress; whilst the ship<br/> was steadily making her way within
                    sight of the<br/> town, and all was given up for lost, there being<br/> no
                    prospect of help, at this critical moment, the<br/> ship struck upon a sandbank,
                    where she remained<br/> immoveable. The town was thus providentially<br/> saved
                    from destruction, by that All-powerful arm,<br/> which so often interposes in

<p>I lodged last night at <a href="/places/alexa">Alexan- dria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>. Soon
                    after I fell asleep, I was suddenly<br/> waked by the noise of a number of
                    horns. It ap-<br/> peared to me that the instruments used were cow-<br/> horns;
                    and they made a prodigious bellowing in<br/> the dead of the night. On inquiring
                    I found that<br/> it was the constant practice of the watchmen of<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_043" n="43"></pb> this city, on meeting, to take their rounds, to<br/> serenade the citizens
                    with a loud blast from their<br/> horns, which they carry with them, and which
                    are<br/> used for the same purpose as the watchmen's rat-<br/>tles in England.
                    This morning, in company with<br/> two friends, I crossed the <geogname key="potor">Potowmack</geogname>, and paid a<br/> visit to a family at N --.
                    This family, consist-<br/> ing chiefly of females, were born at Wickersly,<br/>
                    near Rotheram. Their mother was of a family<br/> near Settle who are of the
                    Roman Catholic per-<br/>suasion. The family came over early in the set-<br/>
                    tlement of Maryland by Lord Baltimore; and the<br/> bricks of which the house is
                    built, they informed<br/> me were brought over in the same ship with their<br/>
                    progenitors. The house is constructed upon the<br/> plan of some of our old
                    English mansions; and the<br/> garden is laid out in the old English style. It
                    is<br/> remarkable that I have never yet seen a garden, in<br/> America, walled
                    round as in England. I believe<br/> that one principal reason is the warmth of
                    the cli-<br/>mate, and the clear, fine atmosphere, which pre-<br/> clude the use
                    of fruit walls. Besides, walls would<br/> obstruct the free current of air,
                    whiclh would be an<br/> objection to them. Yet I have frequently seen<br/>
                    gardens handsomely fenced round to the height of<br/> 6 or 7 feet, with neatly
                    planed boards, painted<br/> white or green. It abated greatly the pleasure
                    I<br/> should have received from the hospitality of this<br/> family, when I was
                    informed that they were in<br/> possession of upwards of one hundred
                    Negro<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_044" n="44"></pb> slaves; numbers of whom I saw at work in the<br/>
                    fields, the garden, and about the house. They<br/> appeared to be a remarkably
                    stout, robust race of<br/> men, and, in point of health, had, to all
                    appear-<br/> ance, greatly the advantage of their owners. A<br/> person, not
                    conversant with these things, would be<br/> naturally led to think, that where
                    families have the<br/> opportunity of employing a number of slaves,<br/> every
                    thing about their houses, gardens, and plan-<br/>tations, would be kept in very
                    nice order. How-<br/> ever, the reverse of this is generally the case; and<br/>
                    I was sometimes ready to think that the more<br/> slaves there were employed
                    about a house and<br/> plantation, the more disorder appeared. I am<br/>
                    persuaded, that in a well-regulated family, with<br/> one or two hired servants,
                    much more neatness,<br/> order, and comfort may be preserved, than can be<br/>
                    maintained by treble the number of slaves. I have<br/> been in families where
                    several slaves were kept<br/> which have scarcely afforded the common
                    neces-<br/>saries of life. I have sat at table in families where<br/> two or
                    three slaves have waited upon us, and yet<br/> there has not been a lodging-room
                    or accommoda-<br/>tions at night, equal to what many a labouring man<br/> in
                    England is able to furnish; and, to compare the<br/> accommodations of a
                    slave-holder, in some of the<br/> Southern States, with what the meanest of
                    the<br/> Pennsylvanian farmers are accustomed to, would<br/> be still more
                    unfavourable to the former. </p>

<p>After attending to some busi-<br/> ness, P. J. and several other friends joining
                    us, we<br/> took a boat with an intention of visiting <a href="/places/mtver">Mount Vernon<placename key="mtver"></placename></a>; but, after sailing a few miles on the<br/>
<geogname key="potor">Potowmack</geogname>, the wind got up very high, and<br/>
                    we found it would be unsafe to land: so, after<br/> taking a view of that
                    beautiful spot from the river,<br/> we found it most prudent to return. Before
                    we<br/> had got half way back to <a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>,
                    the wind<br/> still increasing, a great part of our company pre-<br/>ferred
                    walking 7 or 8 miles in the heat of the day,<br/> to the danger of continuing
                    their voyage on the<br/> river; and they were accordingly put on shore at<br/>
                    the first convenient landing. On approaching the<br/> shore, I was entertained
                    with the sight of a num-<br/> ber of beautiful tortoises, that were seated
                    upon<br/> the edge of a large boat which lay a wreck at the<br/> water side.
                    Their colours were as beautifully<br/> variegated as the wings of the butterfly.
                    After<br/> landing a part of our company, we beat up the<br/> river in the best
                    manner we could: and, had I not<br/> been a pretty good swimmer, I should
                    frequently<br/> have considered myself in extreme danger; but<br/> knowing that
                    if the boat had filled with water, I<br/> was able to swim on shore, I had not
                    much fear<br/> about me. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetalex">Alexandria monthly meeting<orgname key="meetalex"></orgname></a> in
                    the forenoon; and, there being a vessel<br/> lying here, which was about sailing
                    for Liverpool,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_046" n="46"></pb> I wrote and forwarded several letters to my rela-<br/> tives in
                    England. Although the atmosphere on<br/> the continent is in general very clear;
                    yet I could<br/> not avoid noticing, that, in this part of America,<br/> it was
                    still clearer than in in any place I had before<br/> seen. The stars seemed to
                    glitter with a brilliancy<br/> exceeding any thing I had already been
                    witness<br/> to. So great was their lustre, that, waking about<br/> midnight,
                    and observing a considerable degree of<br/> light shining into the chamber, at
                    first, I thought<br/> it might be from the moon; but, on recollection,<br/> I
                    knew this could not be the case, and looking<br/> out at the window, I found the
                    light proceeded<br/> from several brilliant stars, which shone with such<br/>
                    brightness as to cause the shadow of any inter-<br/> vening object, much in the
                    same manner as the<br/> moon. The inn I slept at, is kept by an English-<br/>
                    man of the name of Gadsley, and is conducted in<br/> a manner much superior to
                    most inns in this coun-<br/> try, or many in England. Every thing was pre-<br/>
                    served neat and clean, with good beds, and not<br/> more than one or two in a
                    chamber. </p>

                <dateline>On the <date when="1804-09-21">21st of 9th Month, 1804</date>, <placename key="portt"></placename></dateline>
<p>I left <a href="/places/alexa">Alex- andria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, crossed the
                        <geogname key="potor">Potowmack</geogname>, and went down<br/> to <a href="/places/portt">Port-Tobacco<placename key="portt"></placename></a>. In my way I passed through<br/>
<a href="/places/pisca">Piscattaway<placename key="pisca"></placename></a>, where I dined, and where,
                    amongst<br/> other things, broiled squirrels were served up at<br/> table. In
                    travelling along this day, I observed<br/> that the population of this part of
                    the country<br/> consisted chiefly of black people; and, in many<br/> parts of
                    the road, I noticed it was mostly tracked<br/> with the bare feet, some of which
                    appeared to<br/> be immoderately large, arising, probably, from<br/> their
                    almost constant practice of going barefoot.<br/> In many places I had an
                    opportunity of seeing the<br/> farmers busily employed in treading out the
                    grain<br/> in the open fields, with their horses. These were<br/> mounted with
                    several negro boys, who continued<br/> riding round and round in a circle, in
                    which the<br/> sheaves were spread. At the same time, a num<br/> ber of negro
                    men were employed in casting off<br/> the straw, when the grain was trodden out,
                    and<br/> replacing it with fresh sheaves. Sometimes I have<br/> seen ten or
                    twelve horses go round in one circle;<br/> one negro boy having the care of two
                    or three<br/> horses. </p>

<p>In passing by the public<br/> grave-yard at Port-Tobacco, I observed on one<br/>
                    of tile grave stones, the name of Gray inscribed,<br/> with the addition that he
                    was a native of the parish<br/> of Sheffield. </p>

<p>In travelling along the road,<br/> I was a little entertained with several
                    parties of<br/> females riding to their places of worship; some<br/> of whom
                    were escorted by a negro boy who rode<br/> behind one of the girls. On coming to
                    a gate, or<br/> any other impediment, the negro jumps nimbly off<br/> the horse,
                    and, after rendering the service required,<br/> as nimbly runs after his
                    mistress and again resumes<br/> his seat, without any detention of the party. </p>
<p>Yesterday I visited <a href="/people/ware1">Colonel Ware<persname key="ware1"></persname></a>, at his
                    habi-<br/>tation, by whom I was kindly treated. Many<br/> habitations in this
                    part of the country are exceed-<br/> ingly private and retired; and the
                    situations of<br/> some of them beautiful beyond description; but<br/> that
                    cruel system of negro slavery, seems to hang<br/> like a dark cloud over all
                    their pleasant scenes. In<br/> the afternoon of this day, I returned to
                        <a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>,<br/> and, in crossing the
                        <geogname key="potor">Potomack</geogname>, was ferried over<br/> by two
                    negro slaves, who gave me in account of<br/> two of their fellow slaves being
                    drowned, in cross-<br/>ing this ferry during the last winter, at a time<br/>
                    when large quantities of ice were floating down the<br/> stream, which overset
                    the boat. I believe, it some-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_049" n="49"></pb>times happens, that these poor creatures are very<br/> unnecessarily
                    exposed to dangers, when they dare<br/> not remonstrate with their owners. </p>
<p>Arriving at <a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a> in time, I attended
                    their<br/> afternoon <a href="/organizations/meetalex">meeting<orgname key="meetalex"></orgname></a>, and dined with
                    W. P. a valu-<br/>able old customer; and afterwards supped and<br/> spent the
                    evening with his partner J. B.<br/> a worthy Minister. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-09-24">9th Month, 24th</date>. <placename key="frede1"></placename></dateline>
<p>I set out in the mail stage<br/> for <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a>, where I spent the evening, and<br/> lodged at
                    the house of a hospitable person of the<br/> name of J. C. who, though not a
                    member of our<br/> society, has a regard for friends and their prin-<br/>
                    ciples. In some conversation I had with him, he<br/> told me that he came over
                    to America with his<br/> parents, in early life, from Ireland; and being
                    soon<br/> left an orphan, had many difficulties and dis-<br/> couragements to
                    surmount; but that he had been<br/> favoured to establish himself here. I found
                    he<br/> was considered by his neighbours, as a man of re-<br/> spectability; and
                    by many of them was supposed to<br/> be a member of our society. Although
                    convinced<br/> of the truth of our principles, yet I believe he has<br/> never
                    applied to be received as a member; and<br/> being at a considerably distance
                    from any meeting<br/> of friends, and having but little of their society,<br/>
                    except the transient call of such as may be travel-<br/> ling that way, it is
                    probable he never may apply. </p>

<p>I pursued my way to <a href="/places/richm">Rich- mond<placename key="richm"></placename></a> in the
                    mail stage, through a beautiful coun-<br/> try, but clouded and debased by Negro
                    slavery. At<br/> the house where I breakfasted, which is called the<br/>
                    Bowling-green, I was told that the Owner had in his<br/> possession 200 slaves.
                    In one field near the house,<br/> planted with tobacco, I counted nearly 20
                    women<br/> and children, employed in picking grubs from the<br/> plant. In the
                    afternoon I passed by a field in<br/> which several poor slaves had lately been
                    executed,<br/> on the charge of having an intention to rise against<br/> their
                    masters. A lawyer who was present at their<br/> trials at Richmond, informed me
                    that on one<br/> of them being asked, what he had to say to the<br/> court on
                    his defence, he replied, in a manly tone of<br/> voice: <said who="undetermined">I have nothing more to offer than what<br/> General Washington would have
                        had to offer, had<br/> he been taken by the British and put to trial by<br/>
                        them. I have adventured my life in endeavouring<br/> to obtain the liberty
                        of my countrymen, and am a<br/> willing sacrifice in their cause and I beg,
                        as a fa-<br/> vour, that I may be immediately led to execution.<br/> I know
                        that you have pre-determined to shed my<br/> blood, why then all this
                        mockery of a trial?</said>
</p>
<p>In the evening I arrived at <a href="/places/richm">Richmond<placename key="richm"></placename></a>, the
                    capi-<br/>tal of Virginia. In one respect, this has a good<br/> deal the
                    appearance of an English town, having a<br/> cloud of smoke hanging over it,
                    occasioned by the<br/> use of pit-coal. They have great plenty of this<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_051" n="51"></pb> article in the neighbourhood, a considerable quan-<br/> tity of
                    which they ship to other parts of the United<br/> States. There is also a
                    navigable canal for the<br/> conveyance of coal, on which a great deal of
                    busi-<br/> ness is done, and the canal appears to be as well<br/> managed as
                    those in England.</p>

<p>Having business with C. A. of<br/> Gouchland, at a distance of about 30 miles on
                    a<br/> cross road, I hired a horse and rode to his house<br/> in the course of
                    the day. My road lying, part of<br/> the way, through extensive plantations
                    cultivated<br/> by negro slaves, many of whom dwell in small<br/> clusters of
                    huts at no great distance from their<br/> master's house, I had the curiosity to
                    look into<br/> some of their little habitations; but all that I exa-<br/> mined
                    were wretched in the extreme, and far<br/> inferior to many Indian cottages I
                    have seen. </p>
<p>In passing along I observed in some places that<br/> the land was very productive
                    in tobacco, being<br/> a fine rich black mould. </p>

<p>I slept at C. A's, and this<br/> morning set out for <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a>, being ac-<br/> companied by his young man, our
                    road lying<br/> through the woods great part of the way. At the<br/> place where
                    we dined, we were waited on by two<br/> mullatto girls, whose only clothing
                    appeared to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_052" n="52"></pb> be loose garments of cotton and woollen cloths,<br/> girt round the
                    waist with a small cord. I had ob-<br/>served that this was a common dress of
                    the work-<br/> ing female Negroes in the fields; but, when engaged<br/> in
                    business in the house it seemed hardly sufficient<br/> to cover them. In the
                    yard, I observed a number<br/> of slaves engaged in the management of a
                    still,<br/> employed in making spirits from cider. Here<br/> again I had the
                    curiosity to look into some of the<br/> Negro huts, which like those I had
                    before seen, pre-<br/> sented little else but dirt and rags. In travelling<br/>
                    along, I saw several plantations of cotton, in some<br/> of which the negro
                    children were gathering the wool.<br/> In the afternoon, as our road lay through
                    the woods,<br/> I was surprised to meet a family party travelling<br/> along in
                    as elegant a coach as is usually met with<br/> in the neighbourhood of London;
                    and attended by<br/> several gaily dressed footmen: a sight not very<br/> common
                    in the back woods of this country. The<br/> evening coming on, and no inn being
                    near, we<br/> took up our quarters at the house of a planter of<br/> the name of
                    Holiday, where we were well accom-<br/>modated. </p>

<p>We came to <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a><br/> and lodged at
                        <a href="/places/fishe">Fisher's Tavern<placename key="fishe"></placename></a>. The next morning,<br/> I
                    was waked early by the cries of a poor Negro,<br/> who was undergoing a severe
                    correction, previously<br/> to his going to York. On taking a walk on the<br/>
                    banks of the <geogname key="rappa">Rappahannock</geogname>, the river on which<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_053" n="53"></pb> this town is seated, I stepped into one of the large<br/> tobacco
                    warehouses which are built here, for the<br/> reception and inspection of that
                    plant, before it is<br/> permitted to be exported. On entering into con-<br/>
                    versation with an inspector, as he was employed in<br/> looking over a parcel of
                    tobacco, he lamented the<br/> licenciousness which he remarked so generally<br/>
                    prevailed in this town. He said, that in his remem-<br/> brance, the principal
                    part of the inhabitants were<br/> emigrants from Scotland, and that it was
                    consi-<br/> dered so reproachful to the white inhabitants, if<br/> they were
                    found to have an illicit connection with<br/> their female slaves, that their
                    neighbours would<br/> shun the company of such, as of persons with<br/> whom it
                    was a reproach to be acquainted. The<br/> case was now so much altered that, he
                    believed,<br/> there were but few slave holders in the place who<br/> were free
                    from guilt in this respect: and that it<br/> was now thought but little of. Such
                    was the bru-<br/> tality and hardness of heart which this evil pro-<br/> duced,
                    that some amongst them paid no more<br/> regard to selling their own children,
                    by their<br/> female slaves, or even their brothers and sisters, in<br/> the
                    same line, than they would do to the disposal<br/> of a cow or a horse, or any
                    other property in the<br/> brute creation. To so low a degree of degrada-<br/>
                    tion does the system of negro slavery sink the white<br/> inhabitants, who are
                    unhappily engaged in it.</p>

<p>Having paid my fare last<br/> night to go in the mail stage to <a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, I re-<br/>paired to the --Tavern this
                    morning, at the<br/> hour appointed by the landlord, who is also clerk<br/> to
                    the stage; but the circumstance of my lodging<br/> at another inn, on account of
                    the vermin with<br/> which I had been annoyed when I last slept at the<br/>
                    --Tavern, had so displeased the man, that<br/> he had sent out the stage
                    considerably before the<br/> usual time, in order that I might he
                    disappointed<br/> of getting to Alexandria this day. As I stood at<br/> the door
                    of the Tavern, remonstrating with the<br/> landlord on account of his mean and
                    unkind con-<br/>duct in treating me thus, J. C. rode up to us on<br/> an
                    excellent horse of his own; and, as soon as he<br/> understood how the landlord
                    had behaved to me,<br/> he immediately dismounted and insisted upon my<br/>
                    pursuing my journey upon his horse. I accord-<br/> ingly accepted his generous
                    offer, but, before I<br/> set out, I complained to the post-maste, who re-<br/>
                    turned the money I had paid at the Tavern, and,<br/> at the same time declared,
                    that if ever he again<br/> detected the landlord in the like base conduct
                    to<br/> any traveller, he would remove the mail stage<br/> to another inn. The
                    circumstance of pursuing my<br/> journey on horseback, afforded me an
                    opportunity<br/> of visiting <a href="/places/mtver">Mount Vernon<placename key="mtver"></placename></a>,
                    the habitation of the<br/> late General Washington; and I was shown through<br/>
                    the house by a person who had the care of it.<br/> The situation is beautiful,
                    being a rising ground,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_055" n="55"></pb> commanding a fine prospect of the river Potow-<br/> mack and the
                    surrounding country. In the even-<br/> ing, I arrived safe at <a href="/places/gadby">Gadby's Tavern<placename key="gadby"></placename></a> in <a href="/places/alexa">Alexan- dria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, having enjoyed, on horseback, a much
                    more<br/> pleasant ride, than I should have had in the stage.<br/> Thus it
                    sometimes happens that our enjoyments<br/> arise out of disappointments. </p>

<p>A respectable person at the<br/> inn being about to return towards <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a>,<br/> afforded an opportunity of
                    sending back J. C.'s<br/> horse, and I accordingly availed myself of it. I<br/>
                    supped and spent this evening at E. S.'s, a valuable<br/> medical friend in this

                        <geogname key="potor">Potowmack</geogname>; having a<br/> fine view of
                        <a href="/places/wash">Washington City<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, particularly of the<br/>
                    capitol and of the President's house; which are in<br/> sight all the way from
                    Alexandria. In the evening<br/> I came to <a href="/places/geort">George
                        Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, and staid at an inn, in<br/> company with a Messenger who
                    had just arrived<br/> from Spain, with dispatches for the <a href="/organizations/usag">American Government<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>; and, he being an agreeable
                    intelli-<br/> gent person, the time I was with him was spent<br/>
                    satisfactorily. </p>

<p>I set out for <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, in<br/> company with
                        <a href="/people/twash1">Thomas Washington<persname key="twash1"></persname></a>, a relation of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_056" n="56"></pb> the General of that name. With this person I<br/> had some
                    acquaintance, having met with him be-<br/> fore. In travelling along, he gave me
                    a little<br/> account of a visit he paid to Paris, at the time of<br/> the
                    Revolution. Amongst other things, he men-<br/> tioned to me the extreme
                    indifference with which<br/> many poor men paid the forfeit of their lives,<br/>
                    during that awful period. At one time he accom-<br/>panied the American
                    Ambassador, to a place whence<br/> he had a near view of a number of these
                    victims, as<br/> they were about to be executed; and where he was<br/> so near
                    that he could hear their conversation; which<br/> was as light and frivolous as
                    of men engaged in<br/> the common or ordinary concerns of life. One of<br/> them
                    remarked to his companion, that he would<br/> take care that he would have
                    nothing to do with<br/> Revolutions in the next world, seeing he had met<br/>
                    with so poor a reward in this.</p>
<p>Several of our companions in the stage were<br/> French people, and amongst them
                    a Catholic<br/> priest. There was something singular in this<br/> man's conduct
                    and conversation. Sometimes he<br/> appeared very devoutly reading a book of
                    devo-<br/>tion; and, in a moment, he would shut up his book<br/> and begin
                    singing with the greatest gaity, and<br/> talking nonsense to his female
                    companions. In<br/> the afternoon I arrived at <a href="/places/balti">Baltimore<placename key="balti"></placename></a>, and took up<br/> my quarters at J. T.'s.</p>

<p>I left <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. The road<br/> in some parts
                    lying through the woods, and the<br/> wind being very high, we found some
                    difficulty in<br/> getting along, on account of a great number of<br/> large
                    trees which were blown down and laid across<br/> the road. However we got safe
                    to <a href="/places/havre">Havre-de-
<placename key="havre"></placename></a>; but the wind continuing high, it was<br/>
                    thought unsafe to send the mail across the <geogname key="susqu">Sus-<br/>
                        quehanna</geogname>, which is here upwards of a mile over;<br/> so we
                    concluded to lodge here, and see what the<br/> morning might produce. As we were
                    a mixed<br/> company in the stage, the conversation turned on<br/> various
                    subjects; and the poor Negro slaves being<br/> frequently in sight, as we passed
                    along, they be-<br/> came one of course. I observed one passenger to<br/> be a
                    warm advocate for the slave trade; and he,<br/> in very strong terms, condemned
                    the conduct of<br/> friends who were active in the cause of the Negroes.<br/>
                    Amongst other things, he remarked that there was<br/> a tailor in Philadelphia,
                    a Quaker, of the name<br/> of -- --, whose work-board being at a front<br/>
                    window, he had an opportunity of noticing the pas-<br/> sengers in the street;
                    and that whenever he saw a<br/> Negro whom he judged to be a runaway slave,
                    he<br/> would, in a moment, jump from his work-board<br/> and run into the
                    street. If he found the Negro to<br/> be really a runaway, he would take him
                    under his<br/> protection, and send him to some settlement in the<br/> back
                    parts of Pennsylvania, where he would be<br/> sure to find employment; and thus
                    he went on<br/> from day to day, in what the slave merchant<br/> considered no
                    better than highway robbery. The<br/> man who was making these observations, I
                    found<br/> had been in that trade; and that T. H. was the friend<br/> who had
                    with much propriety been a father to<br/> the oppressed Negroes. </p>

<p>The winds having some-<br/> what abated, we ventured to cross the <geogname key="susqu">Susque-<br/> hanna</geogname>; but it being the time of low
                    water, and the<br/> force of the winds having driven down the water<br/> very
                    considerably the boats could not approach the<br/> firm land by more than 100
                    yards, and we had to<br/> mount upon the backs of the boatmen, who car-<br/>
                    ried us through the mud; but with considerable<br/> difficulty, and not without
                    now and then letting us<br/> down in the mire. On getting fairly over, I
                    found<br/> a number of friends by the river side, on their way<br/> to
                        <a href="/places/bym">Baltimore yearly meeting<placename key="bym"></placename></a>; and amongst

                    about three tons<br/> and a half of flour, and about ten tons of Indian<br/>

                    seen in this coun-<br/> try. Indeed the town of <a href="/places/wilmi">Wilmington<placename key="wilmi"></placename></a> has every<br/> advantage; its situation being on a

                    S.<br/> In this place, as is many towns in this coun-<br/> try, I observed that
                    a considerable proportion of<br/> the inhabitants were friends, and what to
                    an<br/> Englishman had something remarkable in it, I<br/> noticed that the
                    females at the inn, where I took<br/> my place in the stage, appeared like plain
                    consist-<br/> ent friends, and indeed they were such, for ought<br/> I know to
                    the contrary. </p>

<p>I took my departure for <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                    the road being through a pleasant country,<br/> diversified with hill and dale,
                    and commanding a fine<br/> prospect of <geogname key="delaw">the
                        Delaware</geogname> and the opposite <geogname key="jshor">Jersey<br/>
                        shore</geogname>, nearly all the way. In passing by some<br/> farms near
                        <a href="/places/wilmi">Wilmington<placename key="wilmi"></placename></a>, I was struck with the
                    sight<br/> of several fields of Indian corn, the crops on which<br/> were finer
                    than any I had ever before seen. On<br/> inquiry, I found they belonged to an
                    innkeeper, who<br/> had manured them well. From various observa-<br/> tions I
                    have made, I have no doubt that the land<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_061" n="61"></pb> in this country, generally speaking, would, when<br/> plentifully
                    manured, yield much greater crops than<br/> can commonly be obtained in England;
                    chiefly<br/> owing to their summer, or season of vegetation<br/> continuing a
                    greater length of time than with us.<br/> In the evening I arrived at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. </p>

<p>This being the first day of<br/> the week, I attended meeting; and, in the
                    after-<br/>noon was at the burial of S. E. who had been a<br/> friend and
                    customer of mine some years. The uncer-<br/> tainty of life, and the fluctuating
                    state of things in<br/> the world, were seldom more fully exemplified than<br/>
                    in the case of this young man. Few men have pur-<br/> sued business with more
                    reputation and success<br/> than he had done; so that, in a few years, he
                    had<br/> honourably acquired a very large property; and,<br/> only a very few
                    weeks before, was united to an ami-<br/>able young woman, to whom he had for
                    some time<br/> been sincerely attached. At this moment, when<br/> everything on
                    earth seemed to smile around him,<br/> and there was every prospect of many
                    years of<br/> happiness, a blight was brought over all, in an<br/> unexpected
                    and awful way. He was suddenly<br/> deprived of reason, and, after a few weeks
                    con-<br/>finement, departed this life, leaving a mournful,<br/> although
                    instructive lesson of the mutability of all<br/> earthly enjoyments. Having
                    received an invitation<br/> from my countryman T. S. I supped and spent the<br/>
                    evening at his house. </p>

<p>I was employed in<br/> business; and having an opportunity, by a vessel<br/>
                    which was ready for sailing, I wrote to my family.<br/> The next day I spent an
                    hour or two in Doctor<br/> R.'s family. The Doctor, although advanced in<br/>
                    years, is still very active in business; and his wife,<br/> who is an elderly
                    woman, continues to be very<br/> active in her family. I found them amidst a
                    nu-<br/>merous group of promising children; some of<br/> whom are arrived at
                    years of maturity. The con-<br/>versation I had with the Doctor was
                    interesting,<br/> he having been intimately acquainted with many<br/> of the
                    leading characters in the Revolution, par-<br/>ticularly with General
                    Washington, and the Presi-<br/> dent, <a href="/people/tjeff2">T.
                        Jefferson<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a>. As Doctor R. had constantly<br/> been a warm advocate
                    for the abolition of Negro<br/> slavery, he sometimes endeavoured to
                    introduce<br/> the subject in conversation with the General; but<br/> always
                    found him extremely backward at saying<br/> any thing on these occasions, as if
                    conscious of the<br/> cruelty of the practice, although he was deeply
                    in-<br/>volved in it. Though a man of great character<br/> and talents in many
                    respects, yet the detention of<br/> his Negro slaves in bondage during his life,
                    will<br/> always be a shade to his virtues. Yet it is but<br/> justice to notice
                    that, by will, he provided for the<br/> liberation of his slaves, who in course
                    became free-<br/>men at his death. </p>

                    I notices a grave looking ancient<br/> friend, whose speech and apparel
                    corresponded,<br/> excepting that the fingers of both hands were<br/> adorned
                    with rings, which I supposed to be gold.<br/> On inquiring the cause, I was
                    informed that the<br/> friend was an approved Minister, notwithstanding<br/> her
                    fingers were so ornamented; that rings were<br/> commonly worn, by some, as a
                    remedy for the<br/> rheumatism, and that this friend wore them on that<br/>
                    account; but those she had on were only brass. </p>

<p>I supped and spent the even-<br/> ing at S. S.'s, where a sister of John
                    Pemberton's<br/> widow was present. She informed me, that her<br/> father was
                    frequently in the practice of entertain-<br/>ing different parties of Indians,
                    who came to <a href="/places/phila">Phi-ladelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> on public
                    business; and that having once<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_064" n="64"></pb> invited a number of chiefs, who were then in the<br/> city, to
                    breakfast, they came to the house rather<br/> earlier than the servants
                    expected, accompanied by<br/> their interpreter. However they were
                    introduced<br/> into the breakfast room, where a servant was en-<br/>gaged in
                    brightening up some of the brass work<br/> about the fire-place, and were
                    desired to sit down<br/> until her master made his appearance. They had<br/> not
                    sat long, before one of the Indians made an<br/> observation in his own
                    language, which the inter-<br/>preter was desired to put into English; but this
                    he<br/> objected to, alledging that what the Indian had<br/> said was a matter
                    of indifference, and not worth<br/> repeating. On being closely pressed to keep
                    back<br/> nothing the Indians might say, as every thing from<br/> them would be
                    interesting, he complied, and said<br/> that the remark which the Indian made
                    was this:<br/>
<q>Look,</q> said he to his fellow Indians, <q>at that ser-<br/>vant, how she
                        labours at those andirons. I dare say,<br/> if we had come yesterday, we
                        should have found her<br/> at the same employment; and if we come to-<br/>
                        morrow morning it is ten to one but we shall still<br/> find her at the same
                        work. How foolish these<br/> white people are! thus to labour and toil
                        about<br/> things which can answer no good purpose; cer-<br/>tainly these
                        white people must be fools!</q> Thus<br/> the Indians judge the civilized
                    part of the world;<br/> and what is called the civilized world, is not
                    behind<br/> in judging the Indians; so apt are we to judge<br/> one another.</p>

<p>In conversation with a friend<br/> of the name of R. W. he informed me that, in
                    the<br/> early part of his life, he was on the island of the<br/> Havanna, where
                    he had some considerable business<br/> to transact; but being ignorant of the
                    Spanish<br/> language, an Irish Roman Catholic Priest kindly<br/> lent him his
                    assistance on various occasions; and,<br/> so effectually, that the Priest was
                    the means of his<br/> acquiring a large property, during a short stay<br/>
                    there. At the time of parting with this friendly<br/> Priest, he presented him
                    with a purse of one<br/> thousand dollars, as a small compensation for the<br/>
                    assistance he had received; but the truly Catholic<br/> Priest declared, that he
                    would not accept of any<br/> compensation of this sort; adding, <said>All I ask
                        of<br/> you, in return for any service I may have rendered<br/> you, is,
                        that if, at and future period, you happen to<br/> meet a countryman of mine
                        in need of assistance,<br/> you would do to him as I have done to
                        you.</said><br/> This affords one amongst many proofs, that the<br/> truly
                    Christian spirit is not confined to any pro-<br/> fession of religion.</p>

<p>This day was remarkably cold,<br/> far beyond any thing I had ever experienced
                    in<br/> England. The thermometer being down as low<br/> as 12, about 20 degrees
                    below the freezing point.<br/> The <geogname key="delaw">river
                        Delaware</geogname>, which is more than a mile<br/> over, and which has a
                    strong current, was quickly<br/> frozen over to that degree, that horses and
                    car-<br/> riages, heavily laden, were seen traversing from<br/> one side to the
                    other in great numbers; chiefly<br/> with fire wood from the Jersey shore.
                    Exclusive<br/> of these, parties of pleasure were seen driving along<br/> in
                    sledges or sleighs upon the ice. These kinds of<br/> carriages are made in
                    various fantastic forms resting<br/> upon sliders shod with iron or steel.</p>

<p>In company with T. W. I<br/> crossed <geogname key="delaw">the
                        Delaware</geogname> upon the ice. The tide flows<br/> to the height of about
                    6 feet in this river, and in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_067" n="67"></pb> it are some sand banks which are seen at low<br/> water. These
                    circumstances produce a very singu-<br/>lar and romantic appearance, by the
                    large sheets of<br/> ice being obstructed and accumulated in various<br/> parts
                    of the river, having the resemblance of large<br/> blocks of white marble piled
                    on heaps. There<br/> being a constant intercourse between the two<br/> shores of
                        <geogname key="delaw">the Delaware</geogname>, it is curious to observe<br/>
                    the various means which the owners of the ferry<br/> boats use, to counteract
                    the effects of the frost, on<br/> its first setting in, so as to preserve the
                    commu-<br/>nication open. On these occasions they make use<br/> of a boat that
                    has two sliders, one on each side<br/> the keel, shod with iron; and, as the
                    shallow parts<br/> of the river are first frozen, they sail as usual over<br/>
                    the deep parts, and on coming to those which<br/> are frozen, they drag the boat
                    out of the water,<br/> and push it along the ice, until they come to the<br/>
                    deep places, when the boat is again plunged<br/> into the water. Thus they go on
                    till they reach<br/> the opposite shore; and as it will, in course,<br/>
                    sometimes happen, in the early part of the frost,<br/> that between the ice and
                    the shallow water, the<br/> ice is not sufficiently strong to support the
                    boat;<br/> in this case it is common for one of the ferrymen<br/> to sit at the
                    head of the boat, with his feet hanging<br/> out, loaded with a pair of heavy
                    iron bound shoes,<br/> and, with a long pole in his hands. With these<br/> he
                    labours with all his might, to break the ice, and<br/> make way for the
                    boat.</p>

<p>I spent this afternoon at<br/> J. D.'s, a friend who, some years past, came
                    from<br/> the neighbourhood of Darlington, with his wife<br/> and family. There
                    is something so remarkable in<br/> the circumstances of his leaving England,
                    that I am<br/> tempted to give them as related from his own mouth.<br/> He being
                    a merchant of great respectability and<br/> liberality, who by industry has
                    realized a large pro-<br/>perty, I believe they may be relied on. For some<br/>
                    time before he left England, his thoughts had been<br/> turned towards
                    Pennsylvania; but before he had<br/> come to any fixed resolution, he dreamed
                    that he<br/> had met with a friend, from that country, who was<br/> able to give
                    him every necessary information on<br/> the subject. A short time after this
                    dream he<br/> came accidentally to Darlington, where he saw a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_069" n="69"></pb> person in the street, who exactly resembled the<br/> friend he had
                    seen in his dream. He accordingly<br/> applied to him, and found the individual
                    he was<br/> speaking to, was <a href="/people/jpemb2">John Pemberton<persname key="jpemb2"></persname></a>,
                    of Philadelphia,<br/> who was at that time on a religious visit to Great<br/>
                    Britain. Having received what information he<br/> thought necessary, he made
                    arrangements for his<br/> voyage to America, and, with his wife and
                    children,<br/> took a final leave of England.</p>

<p>I drink tea and spent the even-<br/> ing with R. J. at her comfortable
                    habitation. It<br/> was pleasant to see how cheerful and lively this<br/>
                    valuable friend is preserved in old age. On notic-<br/>ing the coldness of the
                    weather she observed that<br/> it was the most inclement season she had
                    witnessed<br/> for 40 years. Considering how green and lively<br/> her faculties
                    are preserved in the winter of her age,<br/> it is not surprising that she
                    maintains the esteem<br/> and affection of her friends and neighbours. </p>

<p>I dined at J. W.'s. in com-<br/> pany with <a href="/people/foth">Doctor Fothergill
                        of Bath<persname key="foth"></persname></a>, who had<br/> lately come over to America, on account of
                    his<br/> health. At J. W.'s hospitable table, we were<br/> treated with wild
                    venison, which had been sent<br/> to him from among the Indians. Another of
                    the<br/> company was a partner in a house at Antwerp.<br/> I was sometimes ready
                    to think that Philadelphia<br/> might be considered as a kind of central depot, in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_070" n="70"></pb> which is found people of every nation on the<br/> earth; and where
                    all appear to unite cordially, as<br/> in one common family. Such are the
                    beneficial<br/> effects of a free and liberal policy, the seeds of<br/> which
                    were sown by that enlightened patriot Wil-<br/>liam Penn. </p>

<p>The frost still continuing very<br/> intense, the use of wheel carriages was in a
                    great<br/> measure discontinued: even the stage coaches<br/> being placed on
                    sliders. Carriages fitted up in<br/> this way, glide along with such silent
                    celerity, that<br/> the laws require the horses should have small bells<br/>
                    fitted to their harness, that passengers in the streets<br/> may have notice of
                    their approach; otherwise they<br/> would be liable to many accidents. On
                    level<br/> ground, or in the most trifling descents, there is so<br/> little
                    friction upon the sliders, that I have often<br/> noticed the traces to be quite
                    slack for a consider-<br/> able time, when they have been driving along
                    with<br/> great swiftness; the pressure on the reins being suffi-<br/> cient to
                    keep the carriage in motion. The noise of<br/> carriage wheels, which is, in
                    general, very consider-<br/> able, especially in the principal streets; is
                    now<br/> supplanted by the tinkling of bells on every hand.</p>

<p>The frost<br/> still continuing very severe, I made frequent ex-<br/>cursions
                    upon the ice of <geogname key="delaw">the Delaware</geogname>, where a<br/>
                    great many ships lay bound fast by the frost. One<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_071" n="71"></pb> very large vessel, I noticed, called the Connecti-<br/>cut, which
                    had now been fast near one month,<br/> with her whole complement of hands on
                    board;<br/> being nearly one hundred in number. This ship<br/> was intended for
                    a Voyage to Domingo, and was<br/> completely armed as a regular vessel of war.
                    As<br/> most of the men had received part of their wages<br/> in advance, and
                    the owners were fearful they might<br/> take advantage of the ship being thus
                    detained<br/> and leave her, they had fixed a strong net work<br/> all round
                    her, reaching from the beam, nearly as<br/> high as the yards. The crew being
                    thus inclosed,<br/> had the appearance of a flock of birds in a cage.<br/> This
                    kind of net work is sometimes made use of<br/> in time of action to prevent
                    being boarded by the<br/> enemy. </p>
<p>The Negroes in the island of Domingo, having<br/> thrown off the French yoke and
                    set up an Em-<br/>peror of their own colour, the French Government<br/> had, in
                    consequence declared them rebels; and,<br/> having prohibited all intercourse
                    with them, this<br/> circumstance occasioned the Americans to arm<br/> their
                    ships which traded to that island. About<br/> this time <a href="/people/jpemb1">James Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a> sent a number of<br/> friend's books to the
                    Black Emperor, as a pre-<br/>sent, accompanied with a letter; to which
                    James<br/> received a reply and acknowledgement, written in<br/> a very singular
                    style; the substance of the reply was,<br/> as I understood it, that he was
                    obliged to him for the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_072" n="72"></pb> books; but that he was determined to be Emperor<br/> of Haiti, (the
                    Indian name for Domingo,) in de-<br/>fiance of both the French and the Quakers.
                    Not-<br/>withstanding this determination, he has since been<br/> cut off by his
                    enemies. </p>
<p>This day I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmid">Market-street Meeting<orgname key="meetmid"></orgname></a>,

<p>This day I dined at J. D.'s, in<br/> company with J. F. one of the persons who
                    ac-<br/> companied me on my voyage from England. The<br/> extreme severity of
                    the weather had brought down<br/> several kinds of water fowls from the
                    northern<br/> parts of this continent, which were quite unknown<br/> to the
                    naturalists in this country. J. F. shewed<br/> one one of them which he had
                    purchased, and<br/> which appeared to be a species of duck; but was<br/> much
                    larger, and of a more beautiful plumage<br/> than the common kind.</p>

<p>I still continued in <a href="/places/phila">Philadel-phia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>; and
                    this afternoon was pleasantly spent at<br/> S. S.'s. The next day I attended the
                        <a href="/organizations/meetmid">Middle Monthly Meeting<orgname key="meetmid"></orgname></a>, where I was
                    gratified with the<br/> sight of a young man presenting an acknowledge-<br/>ment
                    to friends, on account of having taken up<br/> arms; for which he had been
                    disowned. During<br/> the time of his separation, he had married an<br/> amiable
                    young woman, who was convinced of the<br/> truth of friends' principles, and
                    joined the society.<br/> The impression made upon the meeting, on his<br/>
                    presenting an acknowledgement, was such, that<br/> he was reinstated in the
                    society before the meeting<br/> separated. </p>
<p>Being invited by J. E. I supped and spent the<br/> evening at his house. A person
                    as also in<br/> company with us, who had made himself re-<br/> markable, in
                    being a principal leader and minis-<br/>ter among those seceders, who give
                    themselves<br/> the name of <a href="/organizations/freeq">Free Quakers<orgname key="freeq"></orgname></a>; and
                    who, during the war<br/> with England, gave friends a great deal of
                    trouble.<br/> The ground of their offence against friends, was,<br/> chiefly,
                    the operation of the rules of discipline, in a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_074" n="74"></pb> variety of cases, that arose out of circumstances<br/> of attending
                    the revolution; particularly with respect<br/> to taking up arms in defence of
                    the country; and<br/> things of that nature. This person appears to be<br/> a
                    man of good abilities, but of strong passions;<br/> and he is considered as the
                    main support of his<br/> society; which is now reduced to a very small<br/>
                    number, and will most likely become extinct on<br/> his removal. </p>

<p>In company with T. S. his<br/> wife, and several other friends, I drank tea

                    mostly of natives of England,<br/> and on this account the visit was peculiarly
                    grati-<br/>fying to me in a foreign land. </p>

<p>This afternoon at B. J.'s, one<br/> of our company was a young woman who was<br/>
                    there on a visit. Her usual residence was in one<br/> of the new settlements, on
                    the banks of the Ohio,<br/> about 500 miles from Philadelphia. She informed<br/>
                    us that many families on the banks of this great<br/> river, are supplied with
                    shop goods from vessels<br/> which navigate it, and are fitted up with
                    counters,<br/> shelves, and drawers, in the same manner as are<br/> shops on
                    land, and well stored with all kinds of<br/> goods. As they sail along the
                    river, on coming near<br/> a plantation, they blow a horn or conch shell,
                    to<br/> give notice of their arrival; then the planters, with<br/> their wives
                    and daughters, repair to these floating<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_075" n="75"></pb> shops, and select such things as they are in want<br/> of; and make
                    payment in the produce of their<br/> plantations; such as grain, flour, cotton,
                    tobacco,<br/> dried venison, the skins of wild animals, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br/> The
                    shopkeeper having disposed of his goods in<br/> this way, returns home with the
                    produce he has<br/> collected, and again renews his stock, and pro-<br/> ceeds
                    on another voyage. The young woman re-<br/>marked, that four or five of these
                    floating shops<br/> have passed by her father's house, in the course of<br/> a
                    day. </p>
<p>She likewise informed us, such was the primitive<br/> simplicity in which they
                    lived, that it was a very<br/> unusual thing to have locks on their doors;
                    and<br/> that when more strangers called upon them, than<br/> they had beds to
                    accommodate them with, it was<br/> customary for the family to spread
                    temporary<br/> beds upon the floor, on which they passed the<br/> night, leaving
                    their own to the strangers. Yet,<br/> notwithstanding the homely fare of some of
                    the<br/> back settlers, luxury is making rapid strides amongst<br/> them; so
                    that many of the most costly manufactures<br/> of Europe and Asia, begin to find
                    a ready sale in<br/> some of their infant towns and cities; and several<br/>
                    extensive manufactories are already established at<br/> Pittsburgh and in the
                    neighbourhood; where<br/> coals are cheaper and more plentiful than in Eng-<br/>
                    land. In some places the mountain side presents<br/> a front of coal, as our
                    rocks of stone in England.</p>

<p>After about three months con-<br/> tinuance the frost broke up, which was such as

                    daily, as on dry<br/> land. At one time I had the curiosity to measure<br/> the

                        <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and, after a pleasant<br/> sail
                    of three hours, arrived safe at <a href="/places/burli">Burlington<placename key="burli"></placename></a>.<br/> Among the passengers in the packet, was a
                    British<br/> sailor on his way to England, being summoned as<br/> an evidence
                    between the owners and<br/> underwriters of a slave ship. He told me, that<br/>
                    he was the only survivor out of 380 persons; 350<br/> of which were slaves. </p>
<p>We read that a sparrow does not fall to the<br/> ground without the notice of our
                    heavenly Father.<br/> How great then must be the responsibility of the<br/>
                    owners of one of these slave ships, who, in the<br/> wantonness of power, or the
                    gratification of a base<br/> and sordid disposition, thus exposes the lives
                    of<br/> his fellow-creatures to every species of suffering,<br/> and very
                    frequently, as in the above case, to a<br/> premature death!</p>
<p>I recollect once being in conversation with a<br/> person concerned in the
                    traffic, and who was dis-<br/>posed to defend it; at length being hard
                    pressed,<br/> he gave up the point, in a good deal of warmth,<br/> with this
                    remarkable declaration:-<q>Why, Sir,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_079" n="79"></pb> you can't suppose that the Almighty looks so<br/> narrowly into
                        our actions as you do!</q>-Thus we<br/> see that the great adversary
                    deceives his victims into<br/> a belief, that their actions are not seen by the
                    Om-<br/> niscient Eye. I spent the evening and slept under<br/>
<a href="/people/gdill1">G. D.<persname key="gdill1"></persname></a>'s hospitable roof.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetburl">Burlington Meet- ing<orgname key="meetburl"></orgname></a>; and in
                    the afternoon set out in the stage for<br/>
<a href="/places/allen">Allentown<placename key="allen"></placename></a>. My companion in the stage was
                    a<br/> young man lately returned from St. Domingo. He<br/> had resided several
                    years there, and had been wit-<br/>ness to many atrocious cruelties which had
                    been<br/> perpetrated on that island, both by the white and<br/> black people;
                    and which are too shocking to re-<br/>late. In making a comparison between the
                    whites<br/> and blacks, as to the faculties of the mind, he<br/> declared that
                    he could perceive no difference,<br/> where the advantages of education had been
                    equal.</p>

<p>I lodged last night at <a href="/places/allen">Al-lentown<placename key="allen"></placename></a>, and
                    came this day to <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>; and, after<br/>
                    dinner, went on board the packet for <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,<br/> where I arrived safe this evening. I have often<br/>
                    admired the prospects around <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, as well
                    as<br/> those from the Sea, throughout the whole passage<br/> to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, particularly in passing Staten and<br/>
                    Long Islands, and when the eye catches a first view<br/> of that city. The whole
                    is indeed extremely beau-<br/>tiful, but not easily described. </p>

<p>Since my arrival in <a href="/places/nycit">New- York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, I have
                    been engaged principally with busi-<br/>ness. On the <date when="1805-04-11">11th</date> I accompanied several of my<br/> countrymen on board the Laura,
                    on their way to<br/> England, and was ready to murmur that I was not<br/> to
                    continue one of the party. Whilst I stood upon<br/> the battery, watching the
                    ship as she made her way<br/> towards the narrows, the weather being fine
                    and<br/> clear, somewhat like one of our finest summer<br/> days, I thought that
                    I had scarcely ever beheld a<br/> prospect more delightful. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline>This afternoon, the <date when="1804-04-12">12th</date>, <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I took my passage in<br/> the packet, and came again to <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a> in the even-<br/>ing, where I lodged; and, on the <date when="1805-04-13">13th</date>, I came to<br/>
<a href="/places/brist">Bristol<placename key="brist"></placename></a>. On the <date when="1804-04-14">14th</date>, being first day, I attended<br/> the meeting at this place. </p>
<p>I have often had to notice the hospitality of<br/> friends in this part of the
                    world. Here again I<br/> witnessed it, in the generous attention of a
                    friend<br/> of this place, who kindly invited me to his house;<br/> where I
                    dined. This friend I found was a relation<br/> to the Wilson's of Kendal. After
                    spending an<br/> hour or two satisfactorily in his family, I went on<br/> board
                    the packet for <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, accompanied<br/>
                    by several friends from this neighbourhood, who<br/> were on their way to the
                    yearly meeting about to<br/> be held in that city. The weather being warm<br/>
                    and fine, and having a clear moonlight evening,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_081" n="81"></pb> we had an agreeable sail down <geogname key="delaw">the
                        Delaware</geogname>; the<br/> pleasure of which was heightened, by the
                    unre-<br/>served conversation of a number of sensible friends<br/> on board the
                    packet. After landing near the spot<br/> where William Penn held his treaty with
                    the In-<br/>dians, I made the best of my way to my old quar-<br/>ters in
                    Arch-street, where I lodged this night. </p>

<p>I attended the first<br/> sitting of the <a href="/organizations/pym">yearly meeting in
                        Philadelphia<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>. This<br/> yearly meeting comprises the following
                    quarterly<br/> meetings, (viz.) Philadelphia, Abbington, Bucks<br/> Concord,
                    Caln, Western, Southern, Bur-<br/> lington, Haddenfield, Salem, and
                    Shrewsbury.<br/> The first sitting was chiefly occupied in calling<br/> over the
                    representatives, reading several certifi-<br/> cates of public friends present,
                    from distant<br/> yearly meetings, and in answering the five first<br/> queries. </p>
<p>In the afternoon the remaining queries were<br/> answered. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-04-16">4th Month, 16th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>At the third sitting a number<br/> of epistles were received from different
                    yearly<br/> meetings on this continent, as well as one from<br/> that held in
                    London. Six thousand copies of the<br/> latter were ordered to be printed, for
                    distribution<br/> within the district of this yearly meeting.</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_082" n="82"></pb>
<p>Last evening I attended a committee of the<br/> yearly meeting, appointed for the
                    revisal of the<br/> discipline. </p>
<p>In the afternoon, I attended the fourth sitting;<br/> the early part of which was
                    employed in reading<br/> several certificates of public friends present.
                    Some<br/> committees were appointed; and a report<br/> from the committee on the
                    revision of the disci-<br/>pline, was read and agreed to. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-04-17">4th Month, 17th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>In the morning, I attended<br/> the fifth sitting, when the consideration on
                    the<br/> state of society, as it appeared from the answers<br/> to the queries,
                    as entered into. The minutes of<br/> the meeting for sufferings were also read;
                    and an<br/> epistle to the yearly meeting in London was read<br/> and agreed to. </p>
<p>In the afternoon was the sixth sitting, when a<br/> report of the state of
                        <a href="/places/westo">Westown School<placename key="westo"></placename></a> was read.<br/> Afterwards
                    a discussion took place on the subject<br/> of report of the Committee on Indian
                    affairs<br/> being read in the meeting; but it ended without<br/> any decision
                    of the question at that time. A testi-<br/>mony respecting <a href="/people/wsave1">Wm. Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> was read, and also<br/> one on account of
                    another deceased friend, which<br/> concluded the meeting agreeably.</p>

<p>Meetings for worship being<br/> held at the three different meeting-houses in
                    this<br/> city, I attended that in <a href="/organizations/pinsm">Pine-street<orgname key="pinsm"></orgname></a>,
                    and afterwards,<br/> being kindly invited, I dined at N. W.'s, in com-<br/>pany
                    with a large number of friends, from different<br/> parts of the continent. </p>
<p>In the afternoon, I attended the seventh sitting<br/> cf the yearly meeting, when
                    it was almost imme-<br/>diately agreed, that the report from the committee<br/>
                    on Indian affairs should be read; and it turned out<br/> very interesting and
                    satisfactory to the meeting at<br/> large. After this sitting, I drank tea and
                    spent a<br/> pleasant evening at W. A.'s, in company with<br/> J. S. a worthy
                    minister, and a broom-maker; a<br/> humble occupation, like that of the apostles
                    of old. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-04-19">4th Month, 19th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I attended the eighth sitting,<br/> when the minutes of the last yearly meeting
                    were<br/> read; also the report of the committee on the revi-<br/>sion of the
                    discipline. In consequence of this<br/> report, it was agreed that any friend
                    paying money<br/> in lieu of <emph rend="italic">personal</emph> service in war,
                    even though the<br/> money thus paid should be applied to the uses of<br/> the
                    parochial poor, would infringe upon our testi-<br/>mony against that dreadful
                    evil. </p>
<p>In the afternoon, I attended the ninth sitting,<br/> which was mostly occupied
                    about money concerns;<br/> when it appeared that the national stock had a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_084" n="84"></pb> balance in hand. In the evening I attended the<br/>
<a href="/places/westo">Westown School<placename key="westo"></placename></a> Committee </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-04-20">4th Month, 20th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I attended the tenth and last<br/> sitting of the yearly meeting. The epistles
                    to<br/> several yearly meetings were read and agreed to;<br/> afterwards several
                    female friends were introduced<br/> from the women's meeting. After a short
                    pause,<br/> one of them addressed herself to the meeting; but<br/> more
                    particularly to those employed in husbandry,<br/> who composed a large part of
                    the body then pres-<br/>ent. In lively and animated language she re-<br/>marked
                    to them, that the nature of their employ-<br/>ment afforded, in a peculiar
                    manner, an opportu-<br/> nity of observing the wonderful works of the<br/>
                    creation; but, at the same time, she expressed a<br/> fear that some of them did
                    not sufficiently, in<br/> these things, regard the Almighty and Beneficent<br/>
                    Author of every mercy. In the recollection<br/> thereof, the words of a pious
                    author recurred<br/> to her memory, which were descriptive of a mind<br/> truly
                    alive to tile feelings of gratitude and adora-<br/>tion to the Great First Cause
                    of all things; and<br/> are as follows:-</p>
<quote type="poem">He looks abroad into the varied field<br/> Of Nature, and th'
                    poor, perhaps, compared<br/> With those whose mansions glitter in his
                    sight,<br/> Calls the delightful scenery all how own.<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_085" n="85"></pb> His are
                    the mountains, and the vallies his;<br/> And these resplendent rivers. His t'
                    enjoy<br/> With a propriety that none can feel,<br/> But who, with filial
                    confidence inspir'd,<br/> Can smiling say, 'my father made them all!'<br/> Are
                    they not his by a peculiar right,<br/> And by an emphasis of interest his,<br/>
                    Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,<br/> Whose heart with praise, and
                    whose exalted mind,<br/> With worthy thoughts of unwearied love<br/> Which

                    rebellious man?</quote>
<p>During the time of expressing the above lines,<br/> an unusual solemnity
                    prevailed; and although a<br/> very large number of friends were present,
                    which<br/> might amount to two thousand, yet not the least<br/> discordant sound
                    was heard. A few the women<br/> friends had withdrawn, some discussion took
                    place<br/> relative to the slave trade, in which it was lamented<br/> that the
                    endeavours of friends and others, had not<br/> produced the desired effect; but,
                    that it was still<br/> carried on with rather increasing avidity. Under<br/>
                    these considerations, friends were called upon in<br/> the most impressive
                    terms, to remember the<br/> oppressed Africans, in their supplications at<br/>
                    the Throne of Mercy; and, under the weight thereof,<br/> the yearly meeting
                    concluded to general satis-<br/>faction. </p>

                <p>I remained at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, or in its
                    vicinity,<br/> for some weeks after the yearly meeting; and<br/> the <date when="1805-05-13">13th of 5th Month, 1805</date>, was spent at<br/> my
                    relation's W. B. Our time passed on<br/> very agreeably in traversing his
                    plantation, or<br/> farm, on the Banks of the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> and<br/>
<geogname key="perkri">Perkioming</geogname>. The more I see of it, the more
                    I<br/> am convinced that it is one of the most beautiful<br/> and healthful
                    situations I have known, either in<br/> America or in England. The ground rising
                    till it<br/> becomes elevated high above the banks of the<br/> rivers, commands
                    a prospect as delightful as can<br/> well be conceived. A view of some of our
                    No-<br/>blemen Parks, on the more extensive scale, may<br/> give a faint idea of
                    the prospect here seen; for<br/> even with such it is comparing small things
                    with<br/> great ones or putting art in comparison with<br/> nature. As far as
                    the eye can command, one wide<br/> spreading Forest is seen, interspersed with planta-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_087" n="87"></pb>tions or farms, and sheets of water; which have<br/> a little the
                    appearance of lawns and fish-<br/>ponds, such as are seen about the ancient
                    seats of<br/> our nobility; but upon a scale exceeding all com-<br/>parison.</p>

<p>I continued at<br/> my relations; and, in one of our walks along the<br/> margins
                    of the <geogname key="schuri">Schuylkill</geogname>, I observed a neat
                    little<br/> cottage, inhabited by a black family, to which<br/> the former owner
                    of the plantation had given their<br/> freedom, with this cottage and a few
                    acres of land.<br/> This little domain was managed with great econo-<br/> my,
                    and afforded them a comfortable and inde-<br/>pendent livelihood. We picked up
                    several land<br/> tortoises, a species of animal which abounds in<br/> these
                    meadows. Here is also a great abundance<br/> of that kind of tortoise, called
                    the snapping turtle,<br/> which makes very good soup; and, as far as I am<br/>
                    able to judge, nearly equal to, that made from the<br/> sea turtle. The snapping
                    turtles are voracious<br/> animals, destructive to young ducks and
                    goslings,<br/> layering hold of them by the legs and dragging them<br/> under
                    water to devour them. </p>

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_088" n="88"></pb> spent about a week in the company of my friends<br/> in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. </p>

<p>I put 10 hogsheads of to-<br/> bacco on board the Rose, <a href="/people/hath1">Captain Hathaway<persname key="hath1"></persname></a>, for<br/> which I paid fourpence halfpenny per
                    pound. The<br/> Captain offering to take with him any little matter<br/> I was
                    inclined to put under his care, I transmitted<br/> a packet of letters, and
                    several little articles for<br/> my family; and with them eight land
                    tortoises,<br/> which all got safely to England. In the same vessel<br/> M. R.
                    took her passage home, in company with<br/> an English family, and a young man
                    from Lan-<br/>caster, in Pennsylvania. They were favoured to<br/> arrive safe at
                    Liverpool; but this poor young<br/> man, taking his passage in the Ontario, on
                    his in-<br/>tended return to America, was lost at sea; the ship<br/> having
                    never been heard of after she left Liverpool.</p>
<p>After parting with <a href="/people/hath1">Capt. H.<persname key="hath1"></persname></a> I set out for
                        <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, accompanied by J. J. and
                    his sister; and<br/> having five other friends in company, we took the<br/>
                    whole stage to ourselves, as we were all going to<br/> attend the yearly meeting
                    in New-York. On our<br/> way we passed <geogname key="delaw">the
                        Delaware</geogname> at <a href="/places/trent">Trenton<placename key="trent"></placename></a>, where
                    we<br/> dined. I have remarked that some people in Ame-<br/> rica, have a great
                    predeliction for wearing boots,<br/> and for smoking segars. Even children of
                    five<br/> or six years of age, are sometimes seen, in their<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_089" n="89"></pb> boots, smoking segars. At <a href="/places/trent">Trenton<placename key="trent"></placename></a>, I was enter-<br/> tained with the sight of a company
                    of journeymen<br/> tailors, at the work-board, all booted as if ready<br/> for
                    mounting a horse. This article of dress is<br/> full as expensive here as in
                    England; yet a<br/> boot-maker told me, that he sometimes sold<br/> no less than
                    three pairs within the winter to<br/> some individuals who earned their bread by
                    their<br/> daily labour; and, for these, they paid 35s. ster-<br/> ling per
                    pair. In the afternoon we passed <a href="/places/prince">Prince-
                        town<placename key="prince"></placename></a>, and, that night, lodged at <a href="/places/bruns">Brunswick<placename key="bruns"></placename></a>. </p>

<p>We breakfasted at <a href="/places/eliza">Elizabeth Town<placename key="eliza"></placename></a>; and
                    arrived at Paules-hook Ferry about<br/> noon. Here I saw a fleet of armed
                    vessels, i. e.<br/> four ships and one brig. As they were full of<br/> meat and
                    guns, and the men were dressed in uni-<br/>forms, they had a very warlike
                    appearance. This<br/> fleet was just returned from the island of St.
                    Domin-<br/>go, with a very valuable cargo of coffee; and was said<br/> to have
                    made the most successful voyage ever re-<br/>membered. At the ferry we were told
                    it was<br/> O--'s fleet, and was principally belonging to a<br/> merchant in
                    New-York of that name, who had<br/> acquired very great riches thereby. This was
                    a<br/> remarkable instance of the great extent to which<br/> the merchants of
                    this country carry their mercan-<br/>tile concerns; yet so uncertain is trade,
                    that this<br/> man stopped payment a few months afterwards.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_090" n="90"></pb> We crossed the <geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname>, and
                    arrived at <a href="/places/nycit">New- York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> to dinner; where I
                    took up my lodgings at<br/> my old friend P. P.'s, whom I found in a weak<br/>
                    state of health. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetny">New-York meet- ing<orgname key="meetny"></orgname></a>; afterwards
                    dined at J. B.'s, in company with<br/> two friends from Canada. In the afternoon

                    observed that the com-<br/> munications from the Indians consisted chiefly
                    in<br/> requests that friends would furnish them with iron-<br/>work, and

<p>This morning I called upon<br/> J. H. with whom I spent an hour or two very<br/>
                    pleasantly, in company with <a href="/people/gdill1">Geo. Dillwyn<persname key="gdill1"></persname></a>.
                    Most<br/> of the time, we sat upon the benches at his door,<br/> the weather
                    being very fine and warm. It is very<br/> common here to have benches, facing
                    each other,<br/> on the outside of their houses, at the oars, un-<br/>der the
                    shade of trees planted in the streets;<br/> where they frequently sit enjoying
                    the fresh breeze,<br/> and the shade. <a href="/places/burli">Burlington<placename key="burli"></placename></a> is a pleasant place<br/> in these respects; the
                    principal street being<br/> fronted by <geogname key="delaw">the
                        Delaware</geogname>, has the benefit of the<br/> cool air blowing from it.
                    This evening I arrived<br/> at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                    after a pleasant sail of 18 miles<br/> down <geogname key="delaw">the

                    attention to commercial engage-<br/> ments, I this day set out, accompanied by

<persname key="ewils1"></persname></a>, for <a href="/places/balti">Baltimore<placename key="balti"></placename></a>, in the Newcastle packet-<br/> boat. We had a

                    arrived at <a href="/places/newcas">Newcastle<placename key="newcas"></placename></a> a little before noon;

<p>we set out this morning for<br/>

                    Baltimore Packet, in which we embarked,<br/> after our refreshment. In sailing
                    down the Bay,<br/> the weather being fine, the Captain sent his boat<br/> along
                    shore to collect drift wood, for the fire; and<br/> she soon returned well
                    loaded. On board the<br/> packet, we dined, supped, and lodged, and break-<br/>
                    fasted next morning. For all this and our passage,<br/> we paid five dollars

<p>This evening I visited Ellicot's<br/> Mills, in company with J. T. and his wife.
                    The<br/> overseer of these mills informed me they could<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_093" n="93"></pb> grind and pack 30 barrels of flour per day. A<br/> barrel being
                    196lbs. or 14st. the annual returns,<br/> at 3s. Per stone, would be nearly
                    200,000l. The<br/> stones were 7 feet in diameter.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-08-06">8th Month, 6th</date>. <placename key="geort"></placename></dateline>
<p>I left <a href="/places/balti">Baltimore<placename key="balti"></placename></a>, in company<br/> with
                        <a href="/people/tmoor1">T. M.<persname key="tmoor1"></persname></a> of Sandy Springs. In the evening
                    we<br/> reached <a href="/places/geort">George-Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, where he is
                    employed, by<br/> the corporation, to fill up the deep channel of the<br/>
<geogname key="potor">Patowmack</geogname>, on the south side of <geogname key="mason">Mason's Island</geogname>,<br/> in order to turn the stream of
                    that river to the side<br/> next to <a href="/places/geort">George-Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, that the harbour may be<br/> deepened. Near
                        <a href="/places/blade">Bladensburg<placename key="blade"></placename></a> we passed a Caro-<br/>lina
                    Slave Merchant, with a company of slaves,<br/> men, women, and children; who all
                    stopped at the<br/> door of the inn where we dined. Some of them<br/> appeared
                    much dejected; and, on my questioning<br/> them, they told me they, were taken
                    from their<br/> relatives and friends by force. One of the females<br/> being
                    known to a black man in the stage, he asked<br/> her how he came there, knowing
                    her to be a free<br/> black. She replied, that some time since, her<br/> husband
                    had been taken from her, and carried<br/> into the Carolinas; and that she had
                    determined<br/> to follow him in his bondage. This appeared to<br/> be a
                    remarkable proof of conjugal affection, and<br/> showed a high degree of
                    sensibility: but, in thus<br/> following her husband, there is great reason
                    to<br/> fear from the general conduct of these Slave<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_094" n="94"></pb> Merchants, that she herself would be sold as a slave<br/> by this
                    man; who, under pretence of taking her to<br/> her husband, would probably
                    betray her. This<br/> night I lodged at <a href="/people/wmorg1">Wm.
                        Morgan<persname key="wmorg1"></persname></a>'s, in <a href="/places/geort">George-Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>,<br/>

<p>I went to <a href="/places/wash">Washington city<placename key="wash"></placename></a>.<br/> The next day I
                    visited <a href="/people/thorn1">Doctor Thornton<persname key="thorn1"></persname></a>, of the<br/> Patent
                    Office, and was shown a variety of curious<br/> models. I noticed one in
                    particular, for picking,<br/> carding, and spinning cotton, which might be<br/>
                    wrought by a child of five or six years old; and<br/> though in but little
                    compass, would spin 18 threads<br/> at once. In the afternoon I visited
                        <a href="/people/maso1">General Mason<persname key="maso1"></persname></a>'s residence on <geogname key="mason">Mason's Island</geogname>, which is a<br/> very beautiful spot.
                    In this excursion I had the<br/> company of <a href="/people/tmoor1">T.

                    the<br/> Mayor of the city, who assisted in rowing the<br/> boat. The great
                    officers of these cities are not<br/> above occasional offices of this kind. In

                    information I received from an inhabitant,<br/>
<a href="/places/richm">Richmond<placename key="richm"></placename></a> appears to be a place of great
                    dissipa-<br/> tion; chiefly arising from the loose and debauched<br/> conduct of
                    the white people with their black<br/> female slaves. It sometimes happens here,
                    as in<br/> other places, that the white inhabitants, in selling<br/> the
                    offspring of these poor debased females, sell<br/> their own sons and daughters,
                    with as much indif-<br/>ference as they would sell their cattle. By such<br/>
                    means, every tender sentiment of the human<br/> breast is laid waste, and men
                    become so degraded,<br/> that their feelings rank but little above these of<br/>
                    the beasts of the field. In the treatment of their<br/> offspring, how far do
                    some of the brute creation<br/> surpass them!</p>

<p>An active clever woman of this place, with a<br/> servant and two children, came
                    with me in the<br/> stage part of the way to <a href="/places/richm">Fredericksburgh<placename key="richm"></placename></a>. She<br/> told me that she was a native of
                    Edinburgh, and<br/> that her husband and family had been settled for<br/> some
                    time to Richmond, as linen-drapers and mil-<br/>liners; had been successful in
                    business, and had<br/> the prospect of a continuance of success; but, as<br/> a
                    longer residence there, would, in their view, be<br/> attended with almost
                    certain ruin to the morals of<br/> their children, they had determined to leave
                    the<br/> place, and remove to a less exposed situation;<br/> where they would
                    not be tried with the con-<br/>taminating influence and effects of this
                    unhollowed<br/> system of slavery. For an active, industrious<br/> couple, with
                    a numerous rising family, thus to<br/> come to the resolution of quitting a
                    lucrative bu-<br/>siness and situation on these ground, is, I think,<br/> a mark
                    of best wisdom and sound judgment, and<br/> is worthy the imitation of all those
                    who are alike<br/> circumstanced.</p>

<p>I left <a href="/places/richm">Richmond<placename key="richm"></placename></a> in the<br/> morning; and
                    reached the <a href="/places/bowli">Bowling green Tavern<placename key="bowli"></placename></a><br/> to
                    dinner. The owner of the plantation on which<br/> this Tavern stands, it was

                    I saw some<br/> Yams growing, at a little distance, south of

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_097" n="97"></pb>
<p>I came this day to <a href="/places/alexa">Alexan-dria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>. In coming
                    we passed <geogname key="mtver">Mount Vernon</geogname>, the<br/> habitation of
                    the late General Washington, a little<br/> on the right, about 10 or 12 miles
                    from <a href="/places/alexa">Alexan-dria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, when we came within
                    about 5 miles of this<br/> city, the stage driver told us that before
                    sun-rise<br/> in the morning, while it was yet rather dark, close<br/> by the
                    place we then were at, his 4 horses suddenly<br/> stopped; but for what cause he
                    could not con-<br/> jecture. However, on giving them a smart stroke<br/> or two
                    with the whip, they suddenly started for-<br/>ward, when he immediately saw a
                    very large<br/> snake entangled amongst their legs; but, push-<br/>ing on with
                    great violence, they soon cleared<br/> themselves; and the stage drove directly
                    over it.<br/> The sound of the horses hoofs, and the sensation<br/> he felt when
                    the carriage passed over the snake,<br/> raised in him the idea of driving over
                    several<br/> sheaves of wheat; and, to the best of his judgment,<br/> from the
                    faint view he had of the reptile, he be-<br/>lieved it to be as thick as the
                    calf of of a man's leg.<br/> The passengers were alarmed, but, on
                    recovering<br/> from their fright, insisted upon getting out, and
                    en-<br/>deavouring to find the snake, believing that he must<br/> be disabled by
                    the wheels of the carriage. They ac-<br/>cordingly searched about the place, but
                    could see<br/> nothing of him; and, as there was a stream near,<br/> they
                    supposed he had got into it, and had floated<br/> down with the current. The
                    senior Magistrate of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_098" n="98"></pb> Alexandria was present in the stage, as the driver<br/> gave this
                    account; and being well acquainted with<br/> the man, considered him worthy of
                    credit.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetalex">Alexandria meet-ing<orgname key="meetalex"></orgname></a>; and, in
                    the afternoon, drank tea with a friend<br/> from Birmingham, now well settled
                    here with his<br/> wife and children. My home was at P. J.'s where<br/> I lodged
                    and was kindly entertained. </p>
<p>The member of black slaves kept in and near<br/>
<a href="/places/alexa">Alexandria<placename key="alexa"></placename></a>, is very great. On market days
                    many<br/> come out of the country with fruit, vegetables,<br/> &amp;c. and some,
                    even girls of 10 or 12 years of age,<br/> are seen walking the streets with
                    baskets on their<br/> heads, without any clothing. Some, both men and<br/>
                    women, are nearly without clothing; and what little<br/> is allowed to many of
                    them is all in rags. Their com-<br/>mon full dress is a coarse sacking or linsey
                    woolsey<br/> shirt and trowsers for the men; and, for the women,<br/> a long
                    garment or a petticoat, and a short waist-<br/>coat of the same meterials; both
                    sexes go without<br/> shoes or stockings, and mostly without hats. I<br/>
                    understood from a respectable person that farther<br/> to the South he has seen,
                    at the houses of what<br/> are called gentlemen, the young blacks waiting<br/>
                    at table, quite naked; without discovering any<br/> appearance of shame either
                    in master or slave </p>
<p>There is a very striking contrast between the ap-<br/>pearance of the horses or
                    teams in Pennsylvania,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_099" n="99"></pb> and those in the Southern States where slaves are<br/> kept. In
                    Pennsylvania we meet great numbers<br/> of waggons, drawn by 4 or more fine fat
                    horses;<br/> the carriages firm and well made, and covered<br/> with stout, good
                    linen, bleached almost white;<br/> and it is not uncommon to see 10 or 15
                    together,<br/> travelling cheerfully along the road, the driver<br/> riding on
                    one of his horses. Many of these come<br/> more than 300 miles to Philadelphia,
                    from the<br/> Ohio, Pittsburgh, and other places; and I have been<br/> told by a
                    respectable friend, a native of Phila-<br/>delphia, that more than 1000 covered
                    carriages<br/> frequently come to Philadelphia market. Indeed<br/> the
                    appearance of them on market-days, in Market-<br/>street, which is 2 miles in
                    length, and about 40<br/> yards in width, is such as no stranger can have a<br/>
                    just conception of; to say nothing of the adjoining<br/> streets, which are
                    crowded with farmers's carts and<br/> waggons from every quarter. </p>
<p>The appearance of things in the Slave States is<br/> quite the reverse of this.
                    We sometimes meet<br/> a ragged black boy or girl, driving a team consist-<br/>
                    ing of a lean cow and a mule; sometimes a lean<br/> bull or an ox and a mule;
                    and I have seem a mule,<br/> a bull, and a cow, each miserable in its
                    appear-<br/>ance, composing one team, with a half-naked<br/> black slave or two,
                    riding or driving, as occasion<br/> suited. The carriage or waggon, if it may be<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_100" n="100"></pb> called such, appeared in as wretched condition<br/> as the team
                    and its driver. Sometimes a couple<br/> of horses, mules, or cows, &amp;c. would
                    be dragging<br/> a hogshead of tobacco, with a pivot or axel driven<br/> into
                    each end of the hogshead, and some thing like<br/> a shaft attached, by which it
                    was drawn or rolled<br/> along the road. I have seen two oxen and two<br/>
                    slaves pretty fully employed in getting along a<br/> single hogshead; and some
                    of these come from a<br/> great distance inland. </p>
<p>In the evening of this day, I had a pleasant sail<br/> up the <geogname key="potor">Patowmack</geogname> to <a href="/places/geort">George-Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, where I<br/> lodged. </p>

<p>I went in the stage from<br/>
<a href="/places/geort">George-Town<placename key="geort"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/frede">Frederick-Town<placename key="frede"></placename></a>, in Maryland.<br/> At this place the death of a
                    person of the name<br/> of Smith, was a general subject of conversation.<br/> I
                    was informed that, in early life, he had been a<br/> transported convict from
                    England, and had lived<br/> and wrought with the black slaves, and had<br/>
                    taken a wife from amongst them. Since the time<br/> of his servitude expired, he
                    had, by industry<br/> and management, acquired 70,000l. part of which<br/> he
                    gave to his children by his black wife; and the<br/> residue, being the largest
                    proportion, to his<br/> white children. This man, I was told, was the<br/>
                    principal stockholder in the Columbia Bank.</p>
<p>I spent two days more at <a href="/places/frede">Frederick-town<placename key="frede"></placename></a>,
                    be-<br/>ing detained by the stage. Great numbers of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_102" n="102"></pb>black slaves are kept in this part of <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>.<br/> One farmer was mentioned to me who kept
                    up-<br/>wards of 200; and from the quantity of land he had<br/> under
                    cultivation, there did not appear to be more<br/> than 10 acres to one slave;
                    which of course could<br/> yield but little profit to the owner. I was told
                    of<br/> one couple of slaves he had, who lived as man and<br/> wife, and were
                    valued at more than 400l. on ac-<br/> count of their stout healthy children;
                    whom he<br/> could sell at a very high price when young. From<br/> the
                    information I received, it appeared that breed-<br/> ing slaves was the best
                    part of his business. Such<br/> is the corrupt state of things where slavery
                    is<br/> permitted. </p>

<p>This morning we passed<br/> through <a href="/places/yorkt">York-Town<placename key="yorkt"></placename></a>,
                    where we breakfasted. At the<br/> Assizes or Sessions, which were held at that
                    time, a<br/> boy of about 15 years of age, was convicted of the<br/> wilful and
                    deliberate murder of his play-fellow, a<br/> little boy 2 or 3 years younger
                    than himself. The<br/> reason he assigned for this cruel act was, that his<br/>
                    companion had won a few pence from him at some<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_103" n="103"></pb> game of chance. A lawyer who had attended the<br/> trial, was with
                    us in the stage, and said that the<br/> culprit appeared unconcerned as to the
                    issue;<br/> and when convicted, showed no emotion; but with<br/> a great deal of
                    indifference requested that his<br/> acquaintances would attend at his
                    execution; which<br/> they did. </p>
<p>At noon we came to the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, on the<br/>
                    opposite shore to Columbia, where we dined.<br/> This is one of the most
                    beautiful and romantic<br/> parts of America. The river is here about one<br/>
                    mile broad, with a number of beautiful little<br/> islands spread over it. What
                    added greatly to the<br/> beauty of the scene, were the high rocks which<br/>
                    rise from the margin of the river, and near which<br/> were seen many eagles and
                    fish-hawks soaring in<br/> the air; the latter frequently darting into the<br/>
                    water, where they make a prey of the fish. In<br/> rising again, it frequently
                    happens that the eagles<br/> pursue the hawks, and compel them to let go
                    their<br/> prize; and such is the swiftness of the eagle, that<br/> he will
                    often dart down and seize the fish, before<br/> it reaches the water. </p>
<p>In the shallow parts of the river, many beauti-<br/>ful white herons are seen,
                    stalking along in<br/> search of food, making a beautiful variety in the<br/>
                    prospect. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_104" n="104"></pb>
<p>I saw a number of large flat-bottomed boats in<br/> this river, some of which had
                    come upwards of<br/> 300 miles, and could carry 1000 bushels of wheat.<br/> The
                    largest of them are more than 70 feet in length,<br/> but calculated for one
                    voyage only, and for floating<br/> down the rivers with the stream, over
                    shallows and<br/> falls; for when they arrive at the place of their<br/>
                    destination, they're taken in pieces and the<br/> timber is used for other
                    purposes. Exclusive<br/> of these boats, which are called arks, and have<br/>
                    frequently a kind of cottage upon them, in which<br/> several persons are
                    accommodated during the<br/> voyage; there are also many large floats of
                    timber<br/> which are so fixed together, that they appear like<br/> one large
                    compact body, on which a small dwelling-<br/>house is built for the
                    accommodation of a family.<br/> These floats sometimes contain several
                    thousand<br/> feet of timber, which are conveyed in this way se-<br/> venty
                    hundred miles, at a very trifling expense. After<br/> crossing this beautiful
                    river in the ferry boat, we<br/> came to <a href="/places/colum">Columbia<placename key="colum"></placename></a>, a small new built town rising<br/> fast into
                    importance. Here we again entered into<br/> the stage, and passing through a
                    fine well-cultivated<br/> country, on a good turnpike-road, we came to<br/>
<a href="/places/lanca">Lancaster<placename key="lanca"></placename></a>; which is considered the best
                    inland<br/> town in North America, and is about 12 miles<br/> distant from
                    Columbia. </p>

<p>This was the first day of the<br/> week: and there being no meeting of friends in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_105" n="105"></pb>
<a href="/places/lanca">Lancaster<placename key="lanca"></placename></a>, I was induced to inquire if no
                    friend<br/> resided there, and was informed of a person resident<br/> in the
                    town, who was a member of our society.<br/> I called upon him and was kindly
                    entertained by<br/> him the whole of the afternoon. After a little<br/>
                    conversation with him, I found he was a father<br/> to one of my customers in
                    America. I have often<br/> thought it a great privilege in our society,
                    that<br/> such an interchange of hospitality and freedom pre-<br/>vails among
                    us. It has a great tendency to smooth<br/> the path of life, especially to
                    strangers in a strange<br/> land. In the course of conversation in this
                    family,<br/> I found that Major Andre and Colonel Despard<br/> had both taken up
                    their lodgings with them,<br/> when prisoners on parole to the Americans.<br/>
                    They spoke very respectfully of Major Andre, who<br/> had so conducted himself
                    as to gain much upon<br/> the affection of the whole family. Some of his<br/>
                    drawings and letters were shewn to me, which<br/> they preserved with great
                    care. </p>

<p>The short time I remained<br/> in <a href="/places/lanca">Lancaster<placename key="lanca"></placename></a>, I
                    found that considerable business<br/> was done in the manufactory of locks,
                    latches, and<br/> rifle guns, all of which are esteemed to be superior to<br/>
                    those imported from England. This day I came to<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> and had the company of
                        <a href="/places/yate1">Judge Yates<placename key="yate1"></placename></a><br/> the whole of the way. In
                    the evening, I attended<br/> the burial of C. W. a young man whom I had
                    left<br/> but a few days before in good health. </p>

                    spent at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>. At this place I was told
                    that<br/> as <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> was once coming up
                    from <a href="/places/newcas">New- castle<placename key="newcas"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, a friend in the vessel re-<br/> marked
                    that both the wind and the tide were against<br/> them; <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> immediately replied, that<br/>
<said who="$$$$#wpenn1">himself had been sailing against wide and tide<br/> all
                        his life.</said> This reply was very descriptive of<br/> the difficulties

<p>The last three weeks I con-<br/> tinued at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, occasionally going to <a href="/places/phila">Philadel- phia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> on business. In the afternoon of this day
                    I<br/> visited P. A. and his wife at <a href="/people/hbowm1">H.
                    Bowman<persname key="hbowm1"></persname></a>'s.<br/> They are an ancient couple of plain, honest
                    friends,<br/> both in the ministry. The grandfather of the for-<br/> mer came
                    amongst friends in a remarkable way.<br/> He resided near the sea coast in the
                    Jerseys, and<br/> being an active lively young man, he used some-<br/> times to
                    employ himself in playing upon a violin<br/> amongst his neighbours; especially
                    when the young<br/> people were collected to dance and make merry.<br/> After
                    one of these occasions, as he was returning<br/> home, late in the evening, he
                    observed a human<br/> skull lying upon the sand; which, as he passed by,<br/>
                    caused some serious reflections; but they passed<br/> off for the present. Going
                    that way again some-<br/>time after, the impressions very renewed, and<br/>
                    while he was musing over the skull, which had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_107" n="107"></pb> thus, a second time, been the means of bringing<br/> into his mind
                    a train of serious reflections, he con-<br/>cluded to bury this dry bone which
                    had so power-<br/>fully preached to him. He covered it carefully<br/> up in the
                    earth, and went home, enjoying the<br/> pleasing reflection of having performed
                    this last<br/> office to the remains of a fellow-creature. Such,<br/> however,
                    were the weight and solemnity occasioned<br/> by the impressions of his mind
                    from this circum-<br/>stance, that a total change in his life and
                    conversation<br/> succeeded; and, shortly after, he joined friends<br/> and
                    became a valuable minister in the society.<br/> Some mention is made of this
                    friend, I believe in<br/> Thomas Chalkley's Journal. His name was <a href="/people/pandr1">Peter Andrews<persname key="pandr1"></persname></a>.</p>

<p>I still remained at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>;<br/> and, this
                    morning, attended meeting there. In the<br/> afternoon, I had the curiosity to
                    take a view of a<br/> large <a href="/organizations/metho">methodist<orgname key="metho"></orgname></a> meeting,
                    held near us, called a<br/> camp meeting; which had been continued about<br/> a
                    week, almost night and day. The concourse of<br/> people was very great; and
                    numbers of them, it<br/> was said, had come several hundred miles to attend<br/>
                    the meeting. Many tents and huts were erected<br/> on the spot; and a great
                    number of carriages of<br/> various descriptions, such as coaches,
                    coachees,<br/> chairs, covered waggons, carts, &amp;c. &amp;c. were
                    col-<br/>lected under the shade of a lofty forest. From<br/> some conversation I
                    had with one of the conductors<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_108" n="108"></pb> of this assembly, I understood that great exertions<br/> had been
                    used to preserve order, especially through<br/> the night; and, that, at ten
                    o'clock in the evening,<br/> patrols went round the encampment to see that<br/>
                    all were in their proper tents and places. Those<br/> who had not a birth within
                    the camp were sent out.<br/> Their meetings had been kept up for several days
                    with<br/> almost incredible zeal, from early in the morning<br/> until late in
                    the evening; and, even after they had<br/> withdrawn into their huts and tents,
                    numbers of<br/> them continued in prayer through a great part of<br/> the night.
                    It may well be supposed therefore<br/> that the preachers were a good deal
                    exhausted;<br/> especially as their language and gestures were<br/> generally
                    violent. Some of the most zealous<br/> would quite exhaust themselves in less
                    than an<br/> hour; but, there being a considerable number on the<br/> stage on
                    which they preached, their places were sup-<br/>plied immediately on their
                    siting down. I observed<br/> that a great number of Negro families
                    attended;<br/> and many of them in handsome carriages. The<br/> whole number of
                    persons composing this meeting<br/> was said to be 5000. </p>

                    his<br/> wife, who is an agreeable friend, was received into<br/> membership
                    about the same time. </p>

<p>I went to <a href="/organizations/meetrad">Radnor monthly meeting<orgname key="meetrad"></orgname></a>; at which
                    was a couple, who were about<br/> to be married; for whose accommodation the
                    meet-<br/>ing at Merion was agreed to be held on 5th day,<br/> instead of 6th;
                    and the alteration appearing eligi-<br/>ble for a continuance, was so
                    determined. After<br/> meeting, I dined at J. H.'s, and supped and spent<br/>
                    the evening at <a href="/people/ojone1">O. J.<persname key="ojone1"></persname></a>'s. This friend was one
                    of<br/> those who suffered banishment on account of their<br/> supposed
                    attachment to the British, during the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_110" n="110"></pb> revolution. His sister told me that on William<br/> Penn's arrival
                    in America, he lodged at her great<br/> grandfather's at Merion. At that time
                    her grand-<br/> father was a boy of about 12 years old; and being<br/> a lad of
                    some curiosity, and not often seeing such<br/> a guest as Wm. Penn, he privately
                    crept to the<br/> chamber door, up a flight of steps, on the outside of<br/> the
                    building, which was only a log-house. On peep-<br/>ing through the latchet-hole,
                    he was struck with<br/> awe, in beholding this great man upon his knees,<br/> by
                    the bedside; and could distinctly hear him in<br/> prayer, and thanksgiving,
                    that he was thus pro-<br/> vided for in the wilderness. This circumstance<br/>
                    made an impression upon the lad's mind, which<br/> was not effaced in old
                    age.</p>

                    oldest meeting-houses in America; and<br/> at the early settlement of this
                    meeting, friends of<br/> Philadelphia went every third first day to attend<br/>
                    it; most of them coming on foot a distance of<br/> about ten miles. At that time
                    nearly the whole<br/> of the road was through a shady forest. Amongst<br/> the
                    rest, <a href="/people/wpenn1">Wm. Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> used to come on horseback,<br/>
                    and would occasionally take up a little bare-footed<br/> girl behind him, to
                    relieve her when tired. By<br/> the early minutes of the monthly meeting, it
                    ap-<br/> pears that several friends were appointed to mark<br/> out a road
                    through the woods from Philadelphia,<br/> to Haverford and Radnor meetings. </p>

                        <a href="/places/frankf">Frank- fort<placename key="frankf"></placename></a> in his carriage, I
                    embraced the opportunity<br/> of visiting a brother of his on the banks of the<br/>
<geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>, where I spent an hour or two
                    agreeably.<br/> Afterwards, he took me in his chaise to the stage<br/> office,
                    whence I rode to the shore opposite <a href="/places/borde">Borden
                        Town<placename key="borde"></placename></a> in the Mail Pilot. In crossing the <geogname key="delaw">Dela-<br/> ware</geogname> to that place, I fell in company with a
                    respec-<br/> table old Scotchman, who had been amusing him-<br/>self in fishing.
                    He told me that he had sometimes<br/> had the company of <a href="/people/morea">General Moreau<persname key="morea"></persname></a> in his amuse-<br/>ments, of whom he spoke highly,
                    as a man of mild<br/> and agreeable manners. I spent this evening at<br/>
<a href="/places/borde">Borden Town<placename key="borde"></placename></a>, the residence of the noted
                        <a href="/people/tpayn1">Thomas Payne<persname key="tpayn1"></persname></a>. My lodgings being at
                    the tavern from<br/> whence the stage set out early in the morning, I<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_113" n="113"></pb> was thrown into a mixed company of the towns-<br/>people. Being a
                    stranger, this extraordinary<br/> person was introduced as a subject of
                    conver-<br/>sation; but the company being of different reli-<br/>gious and
                    political sentiments, I found that nothing<br/> correct could be gathered
                    respecting the charac-<br/>ter of this man, even amongst his townsmen and<br/>
                    neighbours. Some of them asserted that he was a<br/> drunkard; others the
                    contrary. Some asserted that<br/> he was not fit to live, and others with equal
                    earnest-<br/>ness that he was an upright honest man, and kind<br/> and friendly
                    to the poor. Perhaps all might have<br/> some ground for their assertions, by
                    viewing dif-<br/>ferent periods of his life; but what appeared the<br/> most
                    remarkable was an observation of the land-<br/>lady, who asserted her belief,
                    that he was an<br/> enemy to American freedom, and that he was<br/> supported by
                    Great Britain, and was the friend of<br/> that Government. In proof of her
                    assertion, she<br/> said that he had treacherously mixed black sand<br/> in the
                    American gunpowder, intended to be used<br/> against the English. All this,
                    however, manifested<br/> that the mind of man is liable to be darkened and<br/>
                    clouded by party spirit, which so much prevails in<br/> the world; and which
                    seems inseparable from free<br/> Governments, when mankind, individually,
                    are<br/> unwilling to come under the government of the<br/> Prince of Peace.

<p>I came to South <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>;<br/> some parts of the
                    road were through a fruitful<br/> land, and others through a land almost as
                    sandy<br/> and barren as the deserts of Arabia. </p>

<p>I was unexpectedly detained<br/> at <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, the
                    packet not arriving in time.--<br/> This being first day, and there being no
                    meeting<br/> near the place, I spent my time in walking along<br/> the sea
                    shore, and observing the variety of marine<br/> productions that were spread
                    along the coast.<br/> Having my little bible, it was not the least of<br/>
                    gratifications, occasionally to sit down upon a piece<br/> of the wreck of some
                    stranded vessel, which the<br/> stormy ocean had cast upon the beach, and read
                    a<br/> page or two in that instructive volume. Whilst<br/> thus employed I could
                    not help pitying that poor<br/> man of <a href="/places/borde">Borden
                        Town<placename key="borde"></placename></a>, whose name I have recently<br/> mentioned, for having so
                    unwisely deprived him-<br/>self of the great consolations which the
                    Scriptures<br/> afford, by cultivating a disbelief of the truths<br/> which have
                    been recorded for our comfort and<br/> instruction through time.--The situation
                    of <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a><br/> is peculiarly beautiful as to
                    prospects. It com-<br/> mands a full view of the <geogname key="never">Neversink
                        Mountains</geogname>,<br/> and of the light-house at <a href="/places/sandh">Sandy-Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>, by which<br/> vessels generally pass in going to
                    and from New-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_115" n="115"></pb>York and the Atlantic; particularly those in the<br/> European
                    trade. Other vessels also come up the<br/>
<geogname key="rarit">Raritan</geogname> and the <geogname key="hacki">Hackinsack rivers</geogname>, which add to<br/> the beauty of the scene. </p>
<p><date when="1805-10-21">10th Month, 21st</date>. I went on board the packet<br/>
                    for <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> directly after a breakfast
                    made<br/> chiefly of stewed oysters. These shell-fish abound<br/> so much here,
                    that little children are taught to eat<br/> them to breakfast. The landlady told
                    me, that she<br/> sometimes had 2 or 300 bushels in the cellar, at a<br/> time,
                    in the winter season. After being on board<br/> about a quarter of an hour, we
                    were invited by<br/> signal to touch at Perth <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, on the opposite<br/> shore; where we landed about ten
                    o'clock, and<br/> took in two families for <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. As we sailed<br/> along this Bay, I had an
                    opportunity of seeing the<br/> oyster fishers, who were busily employed.
                    The<br/> instruments they generally used, somewhat resem-<br/> bled two
                    hay-rakes, with long iron teeth, having<br/> the handles, which are very long,
                    pinned together<br/> about two feet from the heads of the rakes, so as<br/> to
                    open and shut like a pair of large pincers.<br/> These instruments, which are
                    called tongs, are<br/> opened wide when the heads are let down from<br/> the
                    boat; and, as soon as they reach the bottom,<br/> the men close them, and the
                    teeth of the rakes<br/> meeting drag the oysters together. By this method<br/>
                    from one to three or four oysters are taken at a<br/> time.</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_116" n="116"></pb>
<p>In sailing from <a href="/places/pambo">Port Amboy<placename key="pambo"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,<br/> we picked up a good new boat, worth
                    10 or 12<br/> guineas, which was drifting out to sea. Having<br/> been so
                    detained at Perth <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, and the wind<br/>
                    proving unfavourable, we did not arrive at New-<br/>York until after dark. As
                    the yellow fever had for<br/> some time prevailed at <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, I was desirous of<br/> being put on shore at
                        <a href="/places/brook1">Brooklyn<placename key="brook1"></placename></a>, on Long Island;<br/> but, the
                    night being dark with wind and rain, I<br/> could not prevail upon the Captain
                    of the packet<br/> to land me; nor could I obtain a boat of any kind<br/> to
                    take me over. I was therefore under the neces-<br/> sity of going to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, where all was silent<br/> and solitary;
                    and what used to be the busiest parts,<br/> were now without an inhabitant to be
                    seen. </p>
<p>Having landed at <a href="/places/quinc">Quince's Wharf<placename key="quinc"></placename></a>, I went
                    along<br/> Water-street to the Fly-market wharf, hoping to<br/> meet with the
                    ferry-boat; but here likewise all was<br/> silence and solitude. I then went
                    through the<br/> whole length of Fly-market, which had the ap-<br/>pearance of
                    having been untrodden for weeks past;<br/> the light of some lamps shewing the
                    boarded floor<br/> to be as clean as that of a parlour. From the
                    Fly-<br/>market, I crossed Pearl-street, into Maiden-lane,<br/> and went on to
                    Broad-way, to the City Hotel, a<br/> large spacious inn; where I was the only
                    guest.<br/> When I was here last, the house was crowded with<br/> company; so
                    much had this awful visitation varied<br/> the scene in every part of this busy
                    city. Some<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_117" n="117"></pb> of its inhabitants, with whom I had been well<br/> acquainted, had
                    been suddenly taken away by the<br/> ravages of that dreadful disease. The next
                    morn-<br/> ing I left <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and passing
                    through <a href="/places/greew">Green-wich<placename key="greew"></placename></a>, and over Harlem
                    Bridge, I arrived at<br/>
<a href="/people/twill1">T. W.<persname key="twill1"></persname></a>'s to dinner. There I spent the afternoon
                    in<br/> company with one of the Pilots for the Sound, a<br/> healthy old man
                    between 80 and 90 years of age, who<br/> frequently walked 20 miles a-day. In
                    coming up<br/> to <a href="/people/twill1">T. W.<persname key="twill1"></persname></a>'s, I passed through
                        <a href="/places/greew">Greenwich<placename key="greew"></placename></a>, a village<br/> to which the
                    business of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, together with<br/> the
                    banks and public offices, were removed on ac-<br/> count of the yellow fever.
                    The bustle and con-<br/>fusion occasioned thereby is not easily conceived.<br/>
                    For the accommodation of the merchants, many<br/> temporary wooden buildings
                    were erected. </p>

<p>I accompanied T. and E.<br/> W. to <a href="/places/westc">West
                        Chester<placename key="westc"></placename></a> meeting; and, in the after-<br/>noon, drank tea and
                    spent a few hours with I. C.'s<br/> family, who were under affliction on account
                    of<br/> the decease of his wife. She had been lately re-<br/>moved by the yellow
                    fever, having, it was sup-<br/> posed, taken the infection the day previous
                    to<br/> her coming to <a href="/places/westc">West Chester<placename key="westc"></placename></a>; to which
                    place the<br/> family had removed for safety from the infection.<br/> The
                    removal of this valuable friend, has been a<br/> very trying dispensation to her
                    husband and family.<br/> If I understand right, she has left 13 children. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_118" n="118"></pb>
<p>In conversation with her daughters, I under-<br/>stood that that the family were
                    not aware that her<br/> complaint was the yellow fever, until after her<br/>
                    decease. She was preserved in so much stillness<br/> and quietness, and,
                    apparently, under so little<br/> bodily pain during the progress of the
                    disorder,<br/> that they had no apprehension of its being this<br/> dreadful
                    complaint, until afterwards informed by<br/> the medical attendants. I lodged
                    this night and<br/> the preceding at T. W.'s.</p>

<p>I came down with T. W.<br/> in his chair, to <a href="/places/greew">Greenwich<placename key="greew"></placename></a>, on business. There I<br/> received letters from
                    home, and also forwarded<br/> divers others to England, by the Centurion.</p>

<p>This afternoon I left F. T.'s,<br/> and went on board a Hudson packet, called
                    the<br/> Traveller, of which Ely Bunker, a friend of Hud-<br/> son, was owner
                    and captain. As soon as the tide<br/> served, we sailed up the <geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname>, having in<br/> company a young man from
                    Hudson, and a young<br/> woman that way on her way to visit a sister who<br/>
                    lay sick at Hudson.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-10-27">10th Month, 27th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>This and the preceding night<br/> I lodged on board the packet. In sailing along this<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_119" n="119"></pb> river, the scenery and prospects are in many<br/> places grand and
                    beautiful in a high degree; espe-<br/>cially in sailing by the Highlands, Stoney
                    Point,<br/> and the <geogname key="catmo">Katskill Mountains</geogname>.
                    Sometimes, for a<br/> considerable distance, the rocks rise from the edge<br/>
                    of the river, in bold, lofty precipices, similar to<br/> those of Middleton
                    Dale, in Derbyshire; and the<br/> river, in many parts, is from one to two
                    miles<br/> over. This gives room for the vessels, which<br/> navigate the river,
                    to pass and repass each other<br/> without danger; although the number is said
                    to be<br/> upwards of 1600. They consist chiefly of sloops<br/> of about 70 tons
                    burthen; yet large ships are occa-<br/>sionally seen as high up as Hudson's and
                    Athens,<br/> being about 150 miles up the country. In sailing<br/> on this
                    river, we sometimes had the sight of 15 or 20<br/> vessels within a short
                    distance of us; and <a href="/people/cbunk1">Captain Bunker<persname key="cbunk1"></persname></a>
                    mentioned that he had sometimes seen 30<br/> in company. Although this river is
                    pretty straight,<br/> in general, yet it frequently winds its way between<br/>
                    lofty rocks and mountains, which cause a variety<br/> of currents in the wind,
                    so as to require a good<br/> deal of care and management to work the
                    vessels<br/> to advantages. It was amusing sometimes to ob-<br/>serve that,
                    while we lay becalmed on one side of the<br/> stream under a lofty rock, the
                    vessels which hap-<br/> pened to be on the contrary side, would skim past<br/>
                    us like an arrow, with a fair wind, leaving us far<br/> behind; and at the same
                    time the company would<br/> divert themselves at our difficulties as they glided<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_120" n="120"></pb> past; but, before we got many miles, it sometimes<br/> happened
                    that the tables were turned; and the winds<br/> would favour us to get before
                    those who had so<br/> recently derided us. To persons disposed to<br/> moralize,
                    there was somewhat instructive in these<br/> changes of scene; as we may not
                    unfrequently<br/> observe similar occurrences in our passage through<br/> life.

<p>I arrived at <a href="/places/huds">Hudson<placename key="huds"></placename></a> early<br/> in the
                    afternoon, and paid for my passage, of<br/> about 150 miles, one dollar and a
                    half; and was<br/> charged three quarters of a dollar per day for<br/> board and
                    liquor during the voyage. As we<br/> were about leaving the sloop, a boy came
                    on<br/> board, and abruptly told the young woman, our<br/> fellow-passenger,
                    that her sister, whom she was<br/> come to see, had just breathed her last.
                    That<br/> proved more than the poor girl could bear; and<br/> she was not in a
                    situation to leave the vessel while<br/> I staid. It was a great pity that more
                    caution<br/> was not observed in conveying such afflictive intel-<br/> ligence.
                    In stepping ashore at Hudson, one of the<br/> first persons I met with was
                        <a href="/people/gbunk1">George Bunker<persname key="gbunk1"></persname></a>, the<br/> first mate of the
                    ship in which I came over<br/> to America, whose family reside here. He<br/>
                    kindly sent his son as my guide to T. C.'s, whence<br/> I went that evening to
                    H. M.'s, and lodged at his<br/> house on the banks of <geogname key="clave">Claverick Creek</geogname>. </p>

<p>I spent this day pleasantly at<br/>
<a href="/places/sunny">Sunnyside<placename key="sunny"></placename></a>, the residence of a relation, and
                    went with<br/> him over his farm. He has purchased 300 acres<br/> of land, with
                    a dwelling-house and barn, for 900l.<br/> sterling. The estate runs near a mile
                    on the<br/> banks of a river, which is stored with plenty of fish,<br/> and
                    which passes into the <geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname> about
                    five<br/> miles below. On the opposite side of the farm,<br/> there is a good
                    turnpike-road, leaving to Hudson,<br/> &amp;c. About 100 acres are cleared from
                    wood,<br/> and are in a state of cultivation; remaining<br/> 200 acres being
                    wood land, are esteemed the<br/> most valuable. There are about 20 acres of<br/>
                    meadow near the river. This land is very rich<br/> and productive; and the whole
                    of the estate,<br/> if in many parts of Yorkshire, would be thought<br/> good
                    and valuable land: inferior, I believe, is<br/> sometimes sold for 100l. per
                    acre. </p>

<p>This morning I walked to<br/> the residence of H. M. jun. near his mill on<br/>
<geogname key="clave">Claverick Creek</geogname>. At this mill is a fall of
                    about<br/> 30 feet, over one of the most rugged rocks I ever<br/> saw. In
                    England the strata of rocks commonly<br/> lie horizontally, but here they are
                    nearly perpen-<br/> dicular, forming many rugged points and pin-<br/>nacles,
                    over which the water is thrown with no<br/> little foam and noise. After dining,
                    and spending<br/> a few hours very pleasantly, we returned to <a href="/places/sunny">Sun-nyside<placename key="sunny"></placename></a> in the evening. </p>

<p>This day I came to <a href="/organizations/meethudson">Hudson meeting<orgname key="meethudson"></orgname></a>, in
                    company with as many of H. M.'s<br/> family as could ride in their coachee, a
                    handsome<br/> carriage drawn by two horses. After meeting I<br/> dined at the
                    house of a worthy elder. In conversa-<br/>tion he gave me a little history of H.
                    B. whose near<br/> neighbour and friend he had been for many years;<br/> even
                    for some time before she appeared as a<br/> minister. Her first appearances, he
                    observed,<br/> were very acceptable, and in a good degree of<br/> humility.
                    About that time he accompanied J. T.<br/> on a visit to her, who expressed his
                    belief that she<br/> was rightly called, and encouraged her in the<br/> exercise
                    of her gift. This circumstance tended<br/> to open her way more fully in the
                    minds of friends,<br/> and her communications became more frequent,<br/> and
                    were enlarged. Notwithstanding this, the<br/> friend observed to me, that he
                    very often had his<br/> fears on her account, and sometimes imparted them<br/>
                    to her. About the time she applied for a certi-<br/> ficate to visit England, he
                    felt more forcibly her<br/> danger, and that it would he increased by her
                    in-<br/>troduction to the cities of Europe; and it was<br/> some time before he
                    could determine to sign her<br/> certificate; but the fear of appearing
                    singular,<br/> outweighed his better feelings, and he accordingly<br/> signed
                    it. Notwithstanding the very fallacious<br/> sentiments she had propagated, I
                    felt charity and<br/> good-will towards her; and called to see her hus-<br/>
                    band; she being from home. </p>

                    come<br/> at the prize. The American hare is not like<br/> either the hare or
                    the rabbit of England, but has<br/> the appearance of a mixture of both. When
                    the<br/> poor creature was taken, it cried like an infant. </p>

                    with us in the coachee, and found the<br/> innkeepers very cheerfully spread a
                    table, with a<br/> cloth and knives and forks, being well satisfied<br/> with
                    the profit on the feed of our horses and the<br/> little liquor we drank. This
                    being the general<br/> practice, it makes travelling more easy as to
                    ex-<br/>pense; for the whole the innkeeper had to receive<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_124" n="124"></pb> of us, being a company of 5 or 6, was not more<br/> than half a
                    crown at dinner. By retail, a glass of<br/> brandy or rum and water, such as is

                    Although the means of intoxication are more<br/> easily attained than in
                    England, yet I think, on<br/> the whole, that all classes are more sober
                    here<br/> than in my native land. The frequent elections<br/> have a strong
                    tendency to promote intemperance;<br/> but as a seat in the legislature in this
                    country, is<br/> not, in its consequence, so lucrative as in England,<br/> there
                    is not the same inducement for corruption<br/> and intemperance. This evening we reached<br/>

<p>We continued our rout and<br/> reached T. M.'s to dinner, where we spent the
                    after-<br/> noon, and lodged at night. This friend made re-<br/> spectful
                    mention of <a href="/people/tcoll1">Tho. Colley<persname key="tcoll1"></persname></a>, whose companion<br/>
                    he was for some time in his travels in this country.<br/> During the Revolution,
                    T. M. with some other<br/> friends, was taken prisoner by the British, and<br/>
                    confined a long time on board a prison ship.<br/> Whilst there, he employed
                    himself in making a<br/> variety of little articles in wood, some of which<br/>
                    he showed me. They were very neatly executed,<br/> and bore testimony that they
                    had been made,<br/> rather to pass on time than to earn wages. In<br/> one of
                    these memories of his captivity, he had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_125" n="125"></pb> a quantity of tea, which had been gathered in the<br/> woods about
                    his dwelling. It had much the ap-<br/>pearance and flavour of common bohea tea.

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetnp">Nine Partners Quarterly Meeting<orgname key="meetnp"></orgname></a>.
                    At this meeting there were<br/> three friends in the gallery, sitting near
                    together,<br/> whose ages united made about 300 years. After<br/> meeting, we
                    spent an hour or two in the school<br/> for friends' children, where the
                    teachers kindly<br/> brought forward a few of their best readers, both<br/> boys
                    and girls, and gave us a specimen of their<br/> abilities in that branch of
                    learning. Some of them<br/> read well, and did credit to the institution.<br/>
                    Amongst the teachers, I observed a young couple,<br/> who had been married some
                    time: the husband<br/> was between 17 and 18 years old, and the wife a<br/>
                    little older, but not much. One consequence of<br/> such early marriages is,
                    that many generations are<br/> frequently seen living at the same time. The<br/>
                    children of my acquaintance, <a href="/people/jbidd1">John Biddle<persname key="jbidd1"></persname></a>,
                    of Philadelphia, are the seventh genera-<br/> tion; the female head of which
                    family was a friend<br/> then living. In the afternoon I visited T. R. and<br/>
                    his wife, in whose company we spent half an hour<br/> pleasantly. After leaving
                    them, we set out for<br/>
<a href="/organizations/stanfordqm">Stamford quarterly meeting<orgname key="stanfordqm"></orgname></a>, and lodged at A.

<div type="entry">

<p>Came to <a href="/people/punde1">P. U.<persname key="punde1"></persname></a>'s, where I<br/> lodged. Here I
                    saw several articles very neatly<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_126" n="126"></pb> painted, and which appeared to me neater and<br/> more lively than
                    oil painting, and which, I was<br/> informed, consisted of nothing but the
                    colouring<br/> substance ground down with curds. Here I also<br/> saw a quantity
                    of sewing silk made in this coun-<br/> try, and produced from silk worms raised
                    in<br/> Mansfield, in Connecticut; in which place upwards<br/> of ten tons of
                    silk had been produced the last year.<br/> In the afternoon of this day we
                    visited M. C. at<br/> his farm, which is one of the neatest and best<br/>
                    conducted I have seen, where I saw a ram from<br/> the Straits of Magellan,
                    which had been presented<br/> to him by his brother Captain H. who had
                    brought<br/> it from thence. The animal was of great strength,<br/> and much
                    larger than any English sheep. He had<br/> two large horns standing upwards,
                    somewhat like<br/> those of a goat; and two others growing from<br/> near the
                    roots of the former, twisted like those of<br/> other sheep. His colour was
                    black, and his wool<br/> of a coarse quality. Afterwards we visited Captain<br/>
                    S. C. at his farm, which is, I believe, a very good<br/> one; and it has an
                    excellent house and good accom-<br/>modation, and is very pleasantly situated.
                    On our<br/> way this friend met and passed us, with a waggon<br/> load of
                    slaughtered hogs for the next country store;<br/> but he soon returned, and we
                    supped and spent a few<br/> hours very pleasantly with him and his wife. As<br/>
                    Captain C. was the commander of the Fortitude,<br/> in which I came over to
                    America the first time,<br/> in company with <a href="/people/tscat1">Thomas
                        Scattergood<persname key="tscat1"></persname></a>, this visit<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_127" n="127"></pb> afforded a pleasing opportunity of talking over a<br/> variety of
                    circumstances that occurred during our<br/> voyage. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/stanfordqm">Stamford quar- terly meeting<orgname key="stanfordqm"></orgname></a>.
                    From my observations here and<br/> in other meetings, in New-York State in
                    particular,<br/> I thought some friends, active in the discipline, suf-<br/>
                    fered loss, by placing too high a stamp on a<br/> coarse, homely appearance in
                    dress and furniture,<br/> without sufficiently coming under that
                    ameliorating<br/> influence which draws out of any reliance on par-<br/>ticular
                    forms of dress and furniture. Truth and<br/> sound sense lead into neatness,
                    decency, and mode-<br/>ration in these respects; but extremes do harm. By<br/>
                    keeping the eye and attention constantly fixed too<br/> much on outward things,
                    the better part is in some<br/> danger of being neglected. In the evening
                    we<br/> returned to J. M.'s, where we lodged that night;<br/> and the next
                    morning set out for Sunnyside,<br/> where we arrived safe in the evening. </p>

                    spent pleasantly in their family. A part of<br/> the time was occupied in taking

                    my<br/> cousin's sister in England, which will give her<br/> friends there some

                    narrow and irregular, and<br/> many of the houses are old. On approaching
                    the<br/> city, in sailing up the river, the roofs of many of<br/> the buildings,
                    from being covered with tin plates<br/> instead of slate, exhibit a very

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_129" n="129"></pb> already of considerable extent, although, like<br/> Hudson, of but
                    few years standing. Divers of<br/> the steeples and towers of their public

<p>I attended the <a href="/organizations/meettroy">meeting at Troy<orgname key="meettroy"></orgname></a> in company
                    with the before-mentioned friend.<br/> Here is a very neat meeting-house, kept
                    clean and<br/> in good repair. There is something not quite right,<br/> or at
                    least something that produces very unpleasant<br/> feelings and reflections, in
                    suffering meeting-houses<br/> to become dirty and out of repair. We
                    sometimes<br/> judge of the estimation in which people hold their<br/> guests by
                    the room assigned for their reception and<br/> entertainment. What those people
                    think who<br/> suffer their places for worship to remain a scene of<br/> dirt
                    and ruin, whilst perhaps their own habitations<br/> are superfluously elegant, I
                    cannot comprehend;<br/> I fear it bespeaks their having no very high idea
                    of<br/> the Divine Majesty, to whose service they profess<br/> to appropriate
                    such buildings. This meeting-house<br/> at Troy, I was informed, was built
                    chiefly by two<br/> female friends, whose husbands had sometime<br/> before been
                    disowned for dealing in spirituous<br/> liquors; this traffic being contrary to
                    the rules of<br/> friends in New-York State. Those persons not<br/> seeing the
                    propriety of the rule, or not choosing to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_130" n="130"></pb> forego the profits of this branch of their trade,<br/> had
                    suffered themselves to be disunited. At<br/> the same time they declared that
                    although<br/> friends disowned them, they would not disown<br/> their friends.
                    Since their separation they have<br/> attended friends meetings for worship;
                    and,<br/> being people of property, they have, on all<br/> occasions, encouraged
                    their wives to be ge-<br/>nerous in their contributions towards the neces-<br/>
                    sary expense of the society. I was told that in<br/> this instance their two
                    wives had furnished the<br/> means of defraying nearly the whole expense of<br/>
                    building this handsome meeting-house. In the<br/> afternoon I parted with J. B.
                    and set out for<br/>
<a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> on the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk River</geogname>. I arrived<br/> there early in the evening where I
                    lodged. This<br/> day I sent letters to my dear wife by J. B. to<br/> be
                    forwarded from New-York.</p>

<p>I crossed the <geogname key="mohaw">Mo-<br/> hawk river</geogname>, and travelled
                    about 30 miles on the<br/> Genesee Turnpike. Having company I stopped<br/> with
                    them at an inn, where we lodged. This inn<br/> does no credit to the country.

<p>I was joined by an agree-<br/> able young man from Hudson, of the name of<br/>
<a href="/people/osbo1">Osborne<persname key="osbo1"></persname></a>, who is in the practice of the law.
                    He<br/> had also in company with him a respectable trades-<br/> man from
                    Balls-town Springs; so we travelled along<br/> pleasantly through the romantic
                    valley of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mo-<br/>hawk</geogname>, and, in our
                    journey, saw a few straggling<br/> Indians climbing up the mountains. In the
                    even-<br/> ing we came to the smaller falls of that river,<br/> where the
                    navigation is aided by a number of well<br/> constructed locks. The fall is
                    about 70 feet.<br/> Here is a pretty little town having some good inns,<br/> and
                    standing in a most beautiful and romantic situa-<br/>tion, somewhat resembling
                    Matlock; but the<br/> scenery is more rugged and stupendous. </p>
<p>Here we lodged; and the next morning, the <date when="1805-11-20">20th<br/> of
                        11th Month</date>, we set out, along the German<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_132" n="132"></pb> Flats, to <a href="/places/kerse">Kerseymere<placename key="kerse"></placename></a>, where we
                    breakfasted at<br/> a very good inn, although about 200 miles inland.<br/> In
                    travelling this road, we sometimes observe ves-<br/>tiges of the devastation
                    formerly made, through<br/> the instigations of the English or French
                    Govern-<br/>ments, by the Indians, as they were prevailed upon,<br/> sometimes
                    one power and sometimes by the<br/> other, to join in their wars and quarrels.
                    How<br/> degrading that men, placed in authority, and pro-<br/>fessing to be the
                    followers of Christ, should be<br/> thus employed in working upon the simplicity
                    of<br/> the poor Indians! In the afternoon we came to<br/>
<a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a>, an improving place, of considerable
                    busi-<br/>ness, a little distance from <a href="/places/fschy">Fort
                        Schuyler<placename key="fschy"></placename></a>. In the<br/> evening I came to B. S.'s, where I lodged
                    and left<br/> the horse which his son so kindly lent me at<br/> Albany; having
                    replaced him with one I bought<br/> at Fort Schuyler. </p>

<p>This day I passed through<br/>
<a href="/places/clint">Clinton<placename key="clint"></placename></a>, where I dined; and, in the evening
                    came<br/> to an Indian village, called <a href="/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>. Here I<br/> was comfortably accommodated at the
                    house of<br/> an Indian, whose name was <a href="/people/oscip1">Obadiah
                        Scipio<persname key="oscip1"></persname></a>. His<br/> wife <a href="/people/escip1">Elizabeth<persname key="escip1"></persname></a>, is the daughter of an Indian Chief<br/> of the name of
                    Fowler. She was a personable<br/> woman and of art expressive countenance,
                    and<br/> was very industrious. Her dairy produced ex-<br/> cellent cheese and
                    butter, notwithstanding a<br/> great part of her time was employed in spin-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_133" n="133"></pb>ning for the family apparel, which was very<br/> decent. It was
                    mostly prepared for the weaver<br/> by her own household; and, whilst I was in
                    the<br/> house, a female weaver of the village, brought in<br/> a piece of cloth
                    made from yarn spun in this<br/> family, which was such as would have done
                    cre-<br/>dit to any female in England. This reputable<br/> Indian couple had
                    four fine healthy children, who<br/> sat by the fire; and, though of a copper
                    colour,<br/> their countenances were far from unpleasing.<br/> Their names where
                    Denis, Calvin, Cinthia, and<br/> Celinda. </p>
<p>The schoolmaster of this Indian village, who<br/> is paid by friends, introduced
                    me to a chief of<br/> the name of <a href="/people/haupa1">Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>,
                    with whom I had some<br/> conversation; and we sat about an hour by the<br/>
                    fire-side of a pretty large family of Indians, where<br/> it was pleasant to see
                    the spinning-wheel go<br/> briskly round. There were 16 or 18 Indians<br/> round
                    the fire; the older part of the family sat<br/> on a bench in front, and the
                    little Indians on the<br/> ground on each side. The fire was made at the<br/>
                    end of the building, and the smoke found its way<br/> through the roof, without
                    the aid of a chimney.<br/> The walls and roof were hung with ears of Indian<br/>
                    corn, and other winter provisions. It is difficult<br/> to describe my feelings,
                    on sitting down with an<br/> Indian family in this way. In a sympathising<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_134" n="134"></pb> mind, sensations of pity and compassion will pre-<br/>dominate. On
                    the other hand it is not unlikely<br/> that a similar feeling may prevail in the
                    breasts of<br/> these children of the forest, towards those who<br/> may
                    consider themselves as raised far above them<br/> in education and civilized
                    life. It is remarkable<br/> that an Indian boy or girl is rarely found
                    willing<br/> to change native habits, for those of towns and<br/> cities; but
                    there are many instances, I am told, of<br/> those who are called civilized
                    people, assimilating<br/> their manners with the Indian's; and of giving
                    their<br/> mode of life the preference. Man, as man, is a<br/> strange and
                    incomprehensible being when left to<br/> himself; whether in what is called a
                    savage or a<br/> civilized state. In either, when so left, he stands<br/>
                    equally a ready instrument, in the hand of the<br/> common enemy of the peace
                    and happiness of the<br/> world.</p>
<p>I spent the remainder of this evening by <a href="/people/oscip1">Scipio<persname key="oscip1"></persname></a>'s<br/> fire-side, and was accommodated with a good bed<br/>
                    at night, on which I slept comfortably. Both the<br/> sides and ceiling of that
                    part of the building in<br/> which I lodged, were covered with ears of
                    Indian<br/> corn in the husk; which, to me, had a novel but<br/> not an
                    unpleasant appearance.</p>

<p>I visited the Indian school-<br/> master and his school, and was presented with
                    a<br/> few specimens of writing. Here I met with a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_135" n="135"></pb> little poem on an Indian boy, who was sent to<br/>
<a href="/organizations/harvcoll">Harvard college<orgname key="harvcoll"></orgname></a> for his education, which
                    I<br/> thought worth copying, it being founded on facts.<br/> It is as
                    follows:--</p>
<floatingtext type="poem">
<p>From Susquehanna's farthest springs, <br/>Where savage tribes pursue
                            their game, <br/>His blanket ty'd with yellow strings, <br/>An Indian of
                            the forest came.</p>
<p>From council grave the fathers rose, <br/>Viewing the hopeful youth with
                            joy; <br/>To Ha'rford's Hall, over wastes of snow, <br/>They sent their
                            tawny-coloured boy.</p>
<p>Awhile he wrote, awhile he read, <br/>Awhile he learnt the grammar rules;
                            <br/>An Indian savage, so well bred, <br/>Much credit promis'd to the
                            schools.</p>
<p>Some said in law he would excel; <br/>And some in physic thought he'd
                            shine; <br/>Others, who knew him passing well, <br/>Hop'd he might prove
                            a sage divine:</p>
<p>But those of more discerning eye, <br/>Could then far other prospects
                            show, <br/>As oft he threw his Virgil by, <br/>To wander with his dearer
                            bow.</p>
<p>The tedious hours of study spent, <br/>The drowsy lecture haply done,
                            <br/>He to the woods a hunting went; <br/>But sigh'd to see the setting
                            sun.</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_136" n="136"></pb>
<p>The shady bank, the murm'ring stream, <br/>The woody wilds, his heart
                            possess'd; <br/>The dewy lawn, his morning dream, <br/>In fancy's gayest
                            colours dress'd.</p>
<p><said>And why,</said> he cry'd <said>did I forsake <br/>My native woods,
                                for gloomy walls; <br/>The silver stream, the limpid lake; <br/>For
                                these dull books and college halls?</said>
</p>
<p><said>A little could my wants supply: <br/>Can wealth or honour give me
                                more? <br/>Or will my father's God deny <br/>The humble treat he
                                gave before?</said>
</p>
<p><said>Where Nature's ancient forests grow, <br/>The flowering laurel
                                never fades; <br/>There is my heart; and I must go, <br/>And die
                                amidst my native shades.</said>
</p>
<p>He spoke, and to the western springs, <br/>Stripp'd of his gown, his way
                            he bent; <br/>His blanket tied with yellow strings, <br/>This native of
                            the forest went. </p>
<p>Returning to his native plain, <br/>The Indians welcom'd him with joy;
                            <br/>The Council took him home again, <br/>And bless'd their
                            tawny-colour'd boy. </p>
</floatingtext>
<p>From the Indian village of <a href="/places/broth">Brother Town<placename key="broth"></placename></a>,
                    I<br/> came to another settlement of theirs, called the<br/> Orchard. Many of
                    their habitations are formed<br/> principally of the bark of trees, attached to
                    posts,<br/> which are fixed in the ground; the roofs being<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_137" n="137"></pb> also of bark; but as it is taken off the trees in<br/> broad
                    pieces, they contrive to make a pretty warm<br/> dwelling. A few chiefs, and
                    others, have good<br/> houses of wood, well furnished; and some of the<br/>
                    Indians, being very good workmen, and having<br/> complete sets of tools, I have
                    seen houses of their<br/> building superior to many in England. </p>
<p>As the whole of this day's journey lay amongst<br/> the Indians, whose
                    habitations are pretty numerous<br/> in this quarter, I had a fair opportunity
                    of forming<br/> some judgment of the progress they have made in<br/> the useful
                    arts of civilized life; and I confess it is<br/> my opinion, that many in these
                    villages, are further<br/> advanced in this respect, and enjoy more of the<br/>
                    comforts of life, than many of the inhabitants of<br/> the remote parts of Great
                    Britain and Ireland. </p>
<p>In passing by one of their habitations, I noticed<br/> the Indian manner of
                    preparing deer skins for use.<br/> After taking off the hair, they sew up the
                    skin<br/> like a bag; and one end being suspended by a<br/> support, the lower
                    end is brought close over a<br/> vessel, containing a small fire, of green
                    wood,<br/> at the bottom. The carbonic acid ascend-<br/>ing with the smoke, so
                    impregnates the skin,<br/> that it becomes a dutiable and elastic leather;<br/>
                    very suitable for their shoes, or moccasons, and<br/> other useful purposes.
                    This operation was going<br/> forward under the piazza of a very good frame-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_138" n="138"></pb>house; and, from the appearance of the inhabi-<br/> tants, I
                    suppose the matter was a chief of the first<br/> order. Upon his head he had a
                    very grotesque<br/> kind of cap, much resembling a lofty antique<br/> helmet.
                    His daughter, who appeared to be a girl<br/> about 13 years old, had a very
                    pleasing Indian<br/> countenance; and her arms were ornamented with<br/> silver
                    bracelets of considerable breadth, both above<br/> and below the elbow. Though
                    her dress was en-<br/>tirely in the Indian fashion, with moccasons, leg-<br/>
                    gings, blanket, &amp;c.; but, being neat, clean, and of<br/> finer materials
                    than usual, she had not an inelegant<br/> appearance. These people understood a
                    little<br/> English; but, at several of their habitations, where<br/> I called
                    in the course of the day, they either could<br/> not or would not understand
                    what I said. Some<br/> of the younger boys and girls laughed immo-<br/>
                    derately, on my inquiring of them the road; but<br/> without being able,
                    seemingly, to give me any<br/> other answer. As I went along, I met with
                    two<br/> clever-looking Indian young men, carpenters,<br/> having their tools
                    with them. And under the<br/> piazza of a commodious Indian dwelling, I
                    saw,<br/> hung up in that order, the harness and yokes of<br/> horses and oxen.
                    There was also a good farm<br/> yard surrounded with barns and stables, the
                    whole<br/> having every appearance of good management.</p>
<p>In the evening I joined my old companion again<br/> on the Genesee road; having
                    parted with him in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_139" n="139"></pb> going to B. S.'s. This night we took up our<br/> lodgings at a
                    very good inn, kept by a <a href="/people/stock1">Doctor Stockden<persname key="stock1"></persname></a>.
                    Although in the midst of the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida
                    Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, and 300 or 400 miles inland from Phila-<br/> delphia or
                    New-York, the room in which I slept<br/> was elegantly furnished. It had an
                    excellent<br/> bed, &amp;c. the floor was spread with good carpet,<br/> and the
                    curtains of the windows and of the bed<br/> were of smart Manchester print. I
                    observed<br/> several stout Indian men sitting in the bar room;<br/> but they
                    were not suffered to get intoxicated, which<br/> I thought was greatly to the
                    Doctor's credit, as<br/> many of the tavern keepers supply them to excess. </p>

<p>We set out early and came<br/> to a large good inn, belonging to an <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Indian,<br/> who has assumed the name of
                        <a href="/people/jdenn1">John Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a>. This<br/> is a large brick
                    house, having four good rooms,<br/> and a spacious passage and staircase on the
                    ground<br/> floor. The rooms were not less than 18 feet by<br/> 20 feet, lofty
                    and well furnished. He had an offer<br/> of 82l. 2s. 6d. a year rent for it, or
                    one dollar<br/> per day, which he had accepted. This house<br/> of <a href="/people/jdenn1">Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a>'s, and that belonging to <a href="/people/stock1">Stockden<persname key="stock1"></persname></a>,<br/> were built by Indian workmen, and do
                    them great<br/> credit. <a href="/people/jdenn1">Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a> has two
                    daughters, one of whom<br/> was lately married to a German, a respectable<br/>
                    farmer; and her father, according to a promise<br/> he made, gave him one bushel
                    of dollars as her<br/> portion; and, I was told, he sometimes says, that<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_140" n="140"></pb> if his other daughter marries a prudent respectable<br/> young
                    man, he will give her two bushels of dollars<br/> for her portion. </p>
<p>The Genessee turnpike road passes through a<br/> large tract of land belonging to
                    this Indian; and<br/> has so much raised the value of it, that he has<br/> sold
                    some small lots near the road, as high as 6l.<br/> sterling per acre, which is a
                    great price in such a<br/> remote situation. </p>
<p>As I sat in <a href="/people/jdenn1">John Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a>'s house, I was told
                    by<br/> an intelligent person of the family, that build-<br/> ing so good a
                    house, and making such improve-<br/>ments had nearly cost him his life, by
                    raising the<br/> envy and indignation of the neighbouring chiefs.<br/> Under the
                    influence of these unworthy passions,<br/> they had called him before one of
                    their council<br/> fires, and informed him that they had taken his<br/>
                    proceedings into consideration, and were deter-<br/> mined that he should have
                    the improvements he<br/> had made, and remove into some other part of the<br/>
                    country; that they had observed he was become<br/> proud, like the white people;
                    that the house he<br/> had built was very unbecoming an Indian; and<br/> that he
                    must quit it without further delay. In<br/> reply, he told them that he was
                    ready to comply<br/> with the orders of the chief of his nation, provided<br/>
                    they would make him satisfaction for the great<br/> expense he had been at; but
                    not otherwise. The<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_141" n="141"></pb> council broke up without any thing further being<br/> done at that
                    time. </p>
<p>Shortly after another council was held by the<br/> chiefs; and a messenger was
                    sent to the house<br/> requiring his attendance; but, fearing some vio-<br/>
                    lence was intended, he refused to comply. This<br/> refusal so irritated the
                    chiefs so far that they imme-<br/> diately sent out four warriors, with orders
                    to put<br/> him to death; but, observing them as they ap-<br/> proached the
                    house, he put himself in a posture<br/> of defence; and, being joined by his
                    brother and<br/> two white persons who happened to be in the<br/> house, they
                    were able to make such a defence,<br/> that, after a sharp contest, in which
                    both sides<br/> suffered severely, the warriors were compelled to<br/> fly,
                    covered with blood, being grievously wounded.<br/> Thus circumstanced, he
                    applied for protection to<br/> the <a href="/organizations/usag">government of the United
                        States<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>; and abjuring<br/> his allegiance to the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida nation<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, and taking the<br/> oaths of
                    allegiance to the United States, he became<br/> a citizen thereof. In
                    consequence of this conduct,<br/> an officer of the United States duly apprised the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida chiefs<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> that <a href="/people/jdenn1">John
                        Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a> was now become a<br/> citizen thereof, and of course was
                    under the protec-<br/> tion of that government; and that the government<br/> was
                    determined to protect him. The officer also<br/> stated, that if the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida nation<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> committed any fur-<br/> ther outrage
                    against <a href="/people/jdenn1">Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a>, it would be considered<br/> as
                    a reach of the treaty of peace and amity then<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_142" n="142"></pb> subsisting between them, and they might take the<br/>
                    consequences, which would fall very heavily upon<br/> them. Since this period,
                    he has not been dis-<br/>turbed by the Indians; but is going quietly for-<br/>
                    ward with the improvement of his lands, which<br/> are rising rapidly in value. </p>
<p>My companion, who had come with me from<br/> near Skenectady, having some
                    business with <a href="/people/jdenn1">John Denny<persname key="jdenn1"></persname></a>, the Indian,
                    respecting a mill seat which<br/> he wished to purchase, I left him, and
                    pursued<br/> my way on the Genesee road. In the evening I<br/> reached Moss's
                    tavern, in company with an agree-<br/> able person, whom I met with soon after
                    leaving<br/> John Denny's house. In travelling along this day,<br/> saw some
                    wild deer cross the road. They ap-<br/> peared more light and a native than
                    those in the<br/> parks of England; and, in bounding along, seemed<br/> almost
                    as light as air, being at that time pursued<br/> by a hunter's dog. Here they
                    are hunted for food,<br/> and not for sport, as in England. </p>

<p>I travelled along the Genesee<br/> turn-pike, and passed many fine tracts of
                    land,<br/> covered with beech, the sugar maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br/> Much of the
                    land in these parts, I believe, could<br/> scarcely be sold tor 10s. per acre,
                    to be paid for<br/> in cash; and yet, in the neighbourhood of many<br/>
                    principal towns in Great Britain, would be<br/> thought cheap at 100l. per acre.
                    From the many<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_143" n="143"></pb> local advantages of sod, climate, &amp;c. I think it is<br/> very
                    probable that the long-extending line of the<br/> Genesee turnpike-road, may, in
                    a few years, be as<br/> thickly inhabited as some parts of Europe are at<br/>
                    this time. In the afternoon I refreshed myself<br/> and horse at a comfortable
                    inn on the outlet of<br/> the <geogname key="lakesc">Lake
                        Schaneatetes</geogname>, which forms a sort of mill-<br/>dam, covering a
                    space of about 3 miles by 15.<br/> It was pleasant to observe, on this outlet, a
                    num-<br/> ber of mills, sufficient to do the work of some<br/> thousands of
                    Virginia slaves. It is greatly to be la-<br/>mented that the absurd policy of
                    the Southern<br/> States, has placed these poor creatures as a barrier<br/>
                    against every improvement in mechanics, &amp;c.<br/> Vice as well as virtue
                    brings its own reward; but<br/> the sufferings of those poor objects, on whom
                    this<br/> false policy of the vicious exerts its baneful in-<br/>fluence, are
                    much to be lamented; and a truly<br/> feeling mind will deeply sympathize with
                    the un-<br/>happy sufferers, thus deprived of every outward<br/> consolation
                    that can make an existence in the<br/> world desirable. </p>
<p>Some of the mills were employed in the manu-<br/>factory of cloths. On the banks
                    of this lake are<br/> many delightful situations, which would be highly<br/>
                    valued in a country like England. On every side<br/> they descend with a bold
                    slope, and are generally<br/> covered with fine timber, excepting here and
                    there<br/> an insulated plantation, where the ground is<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_144" n="144"></pb> cleared. These cultivated farms add greatly to<br/> the beauty and
                    variety of the scenery. After<br/> taking some refreshment at an inn in the
                    village,<br/> which is close by the lake, I again mounted my<br/> horse, and, in
                    the evening, came to an improving<br/> town, and took up my quarters at
                        <a href="/places/bostw">Bostwick's Tavern<placename key="bostw"></placename></a>. </p>

<p>After passing by the <geogname key="lakeow">Lake<br/> Owasco</geogname>, I
                    arrived at <a href="/places/cayug1">Cayuga<placename key="cayug1"></placename></a>, where I breakfasted<br/>
                    at a very good inn. <a href="/places/cayug1">Cayuga<placename key="cayug1"></placename></a> is situated at
                    the<br/> outlet of the lake of that name, where there is a<br/> bridge over the
                    lake 1700 yards in extent, which<br/> I passed after paying 13 1/2d. toll. I was
                    informed<br/> that on the setting in of the frost, the preceding<br/> winter,
                    more than 1500 sledges, loaded with pro-<br/>duce, passed this bridge in one
                    day. This lake is<br/> nearly 40 miles in length, and about 4 in breadth,<br/>
                    and opens an extensive communication with New-<br/>York, by joining the
                        <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname> and <geogname key="nrive">North
                        Rivers</geogname>,<br/> with the exception of a short portage or
                    carrying-<br/> place, where the vessels cannot pass. </p>
<p>In the evening I came to <a href="/places/genev">Geneva<placename key="genev"></placename></a>, a
                    handsome<br/> town, situated on a high ground on the banks of<br/>
<geogname key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogname>. This lake also extends about
                    40<br/> miles in length, and generally from 3 to 5 miles<br/> in breadth; and is
                    navigated by sloops. On in-<br/>quiry I found that land sells here from 13s. 6d.
                    to<br/> 27s. per acre, though of very good quality. There<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_145" n="145"></pb> being a bold shore along this lake, there are,<br/> as may well be
                    conceived, many beautiful situa-<br/>tions on its banks. </p>
<p>This night I lodged at <a href="/places/powelt">Powel's Tavern<placename key="powelt"></placename></a>, in<br/>
<a href="/places/genev">Geneva<placename key="genev"></placename></a>, which is, in every respect, a most
                    excel-<br/> lent inn, and capacity of accommodating a large<br/> number of
                    guests. At this inn, I met with an<br/> agreeable and entertaining young man,
                    with whom<br/> I spent the evening.</p>

<div type="entry">

<p>This day I passed the out-<br/> let of <geogname key="lakeca">Lake
                        Canandarque</geogname>, and the town of that<br/> name. The lake is nearly
                    equal in magnitude to<br/> Lake Seneca, and the town extends to its
                    borders.<br/> These lakes abound with a variety of fresh-water<br/> fish,
                    particularly salmon and salmon-trout; and,<br/> what is a little extraordinary,
                    the latter are much<br/> larger than the former, frequently weighing from<br/>
                    70 to 80lbs. each.</p>
<p>In the evening I came to <a href="/people/ghall2">General Hall<persname key="ghall2"></persname></a>'s
                    Tavern,<br/> where I was well entertained by him and his<br/> family. The
                    General, though an innkeeper,<br/> stands very high in the estimation of his
                    country-<br/>men. In the Revolution, though very young, he<br/> was a Sergeant;
                    and, having little or no property,<br/> he has been raised to the rank of a
                    General on<br/> account of his good conduct, and he is now ac-<br/>quiring
                    wealth.</p>

<p>After leaving <a href="/people/ghall2">General Hall<persname key="ghall2"></persname></a>'s, I crossed
                    the <geogname key="genes2">Genessee River</geogname>, and soon<br/> came to an
                    Indian village, where I called at one<br/> or two dwellings, wishing to have
                    some conversa-<br/> tion with the inhabitants; but we were unable to<br/> make
                    each other understand.</p>
<p>Before crossing the river, I passed through<br/>
<a href="/places/hartf">Hartford<placename key="hartf"></placename></a>, where are several good inns.</p>
<p>In the course of the day I met with many<br/> Indians; and after dining at
                    Ganier's Tavern, I<br/> came to Beamus's Tavern, where I lodged. The<br/> last 5
                    or 6 miles of my way lay in a line through<br/> the thick forest; the roads, in
                    many parts where<br/> the ground is soft, being formed of the straight<br/>
                    trunks of trees, laid close to each other across the<br/> road, and then covered
                    with earth or gravel; but<br/> in some parts the latter is neglected, and the
                    path<br/> lies over the bare timber.</p>
<p>At the last-mentioned inn I met with what I had<br/> often heard of, but seldom,
                    if ever seen, a professed<br/> atheist, who openly advocated his opinions.
                    To<br/> all appearance he was sober; yet his arguments<br/> were extremely weak;
                    indeed the poor man seemed<br/> to be labouring under great mental
                    darkness.<br/> Although this was a season of the year in which<br/> thunder and
                    lightning are not common; yet, it<br/> was very remarkable, that during the time the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_147" n="147"></pb> atheist was delivering his opinions, the thunder<br/> rolled over
                    our heads in an awful manner, accom-<br/> panied with vivid flashes of
                    lightning; and, as we<br/> were surrounded with an almost boundless forest,<br/>
                    a most solemn effect was produced. This, how-<br/> ever, he seemed not to
                    regard. I was not disposed to<br/> think uncharitably of any one, on account of
                    his opi-<br/> nions respecting religion; yet I confess I was not a<br/> little
                    perplexed, in my endeavours to make out what<br/> could be this man's motives,
                    for propagating his<br/> cold and comfortless doctrines; and was not able<br/>
                    to devise any common ground of action, unless it<br/> were a desire to gain
                    celebrity, even through ab-<br/> surdity. I am aware that it is not in any
                    man's<br/> power to command his religious opinions; yet a<br/> great deal
                    depends on our cultivating, or reject-<br/>ing such as offer themselves to our
                    notice. In<br/> considering the character of this poor atheist,<br/> who I am
                    told, is a man of good moral con-<br/>duct, I am ready to think that some have
                    suf-<br/> fered loss, under the apprehension that it is of<br/> little
                    consequence what our religious opinions are,<br/> provided a good moral conduct
                    is observed; as if<br/> religion and morality were the same thing. But,<br/>
                    alas! notwithstanding a truly religious character<br/> will ever be found a
                    character of clean moral con-<br/>duct; yet, as in the case of this deluded
                    individual,<br/> some moral characters may be found, who can<br/> even deny the
                    God who made them, and thus shut<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_148" n="148"></pb> up the fountain of every mental consolation; yea,<br/> even of
                    hope itself.</p>

<p>This day I passed through<br/>
<a href="/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a>; and, near this place, met an Indian
                    with<br/> his dog, driving a flock of sheep before him of<br/> about 30 or 40 in
                    number. In the course of the<br/> day I met several hunting parties of Indians,
                    and<br/> came to Vandeventer's Tavern in the evening;<br/> which I spent with
                    one of the <a href="/organizations/hollco">Holland Company's Surveyors<orgname key="hollco"></orgname></a>. He
                    and his companions had been oc-<br/> cupied in the woods, more than three
                    months,<br/> and had not in all that time, slept in a house or<br/> on a bed. He
                    was a young man of stability, very<br/> agreeable, and well informed. The tract
                    of land<br/> they were surveying, was purchased by some per-<br/>sons in
                    Holland, and is therefore called the<br/> Holland-land-Purchase. It consists of
                    3,500,000<br/> acres, for which they paid at the rate of 1 1/2d. per<br/> acre.
                    The principal proprietor is Shimmelpennick.<br/> This land they are now selling
                    from 9s. to 27s. per<br/> acre, but purchasers may be accommodated with<br/> the
                    money remaining at interest, provided they<br/> settle upon the purchase, and
                    improve the land.<br/> By their books of surveys, I observed that they<br/>
                    meted out the tract into divisions and ranges, which<br/> are numbered; a square
                    of about 10 miles making<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_149" n="149"></pb> a township; and these townships being subdivided<br/> into lots
                    for farms. The maps describe every<br/> stream and mountain, the quality of the
                    land in<br/> each division, and the timber upon it, in a very<br/> neat and
                    accurate stile. This surveyor, by living<br/> so much in the woods, had acquired
                    a good deal<br/> of the Indian air in his dress, wearing leggins and<br/>
                    moccasons, as is the manner of the Indians, with<br/> whose company he was
                    sometimes obliged to be<br/> contented.</p>

<p>This day I passed over a<br/> large extent of country, of a very unusual
                    appear-<br/>ance in America. It consisted of what are called<br/> prairies, or
                    pastures. These are large tracts of<br/> land, some miles over, where the trees
                    have all<br/> been leveled with the ground, by some violent<br/> wind or
                    hurricane; and which the Indians, by oc-<br/>casionally setting fire to the dry
                    grass, &amp;c. have<br/> kept clear for the greater convenience of hunting;<br/>
                    and also for planting and grazing. The large trees<br/> thus blown down, drag up
                    with their roots consi-<br/> derable quantities of earth, which, as the tree
                    de-<br/>cays away leave a little mound, with a cavity on<br/> that side of it
                    where the earth was torn up. This<br/> rugged appearance of the earth through
                    the whole<br/> extent of these prairies, is a convincing proof of<br/> the
                    manner in which the ground has been cleared.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_150" n="150"></pb> In riding along these pastures, I met several<br/> parties of
                    Indians, who, from the quantity of their<br/> baggage, seemed to be pretty
                    wealthy, having<br/> several loaded horses. Thus far I have not met<br/> with
                    the least rudeness or improper behaviour<br/> from these people; though I have
                    several times<br/> passed individuals, as well as large companies of<br/> them,
                    when I have been without a companion,<br/> and might have been an easy prey.</p>

<p>In riding along yes-<br/> terday, a few miles from <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo
                        Creek</geogname>, I thought<br/> I could very distinctly hear the noise of
                    the <geogname key="niagf">Falls<br/> of Niagara</geogname>, although then about
                    24 miles from<br/> that stupendous cataract. The distance at which<br/> the
                    people in these parts say the Falls may be<br/> heard, when the wind and other
                    concurring cir-<br/>cumstances are favourable, is almost incredible. I<br/> met
                    with a reputable looking family, driving a team<br/> of our fine oxen upon the
                    road, who told me,<br/> with all the gravity of a man speaking the truth,<br/>
                    that he sometimes heard them very plainly at his<br/> residence, 40 miles
                    distant from them; when<br/> the wind was favourable, or the air calm and<br/>
                    serene. Last night I came to Crow's tavern in<br/>
<a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo Town<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, on <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogname>, just upon its<br/> outlet into <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>. Crow, the keeper of this<br/> inn, told me
                    that in cold weather, or when the wind<br/> suited, the noise of the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname> was generally heard<br/> in <a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>; which is a distance of 20 miles from<br/>
                    them. In this place is commonly a number of<br/> Indians, many of them being
                    settled in the neigh-<br/>bourhood, some of whom are accounted clever<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_152" n="152"></pb> farmers. I saw one of these, of the name of<br/>
<a href="/people/litbi1">Little Billy<persname key="litbi1"></persname></a>, a chief, accompanied by his
                    squa, going<br/> into a merchant's warehouse, with whom they did<br/> business;
                    and I was told, that this Indian raised<br/> more horses and horned cattle than
                    any other far-<br/> mer in the neighbourhood; and had, by this busi-<br/> ness,
                    acquired considerable property. </p>

<p>After breakfasting at <a href="/places/buffa">Buf-falo Town<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, I
                    crossed the Rapids, about three miles<br/> below <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname>. These Rapids are a very con-<br/>siderable River, being at
                    this place nearly one<br/> mile over, and conveying a vast body of water,<br/>
                    which passes in its course from Lake Erie<br/> to Lake Ontario. I observed, as I
                    rode along,<br/> a number of large fishes that were thrown on<br/> shore; and
                    saw many ravens hovering about and<br/> devouring them. In travelling upon the
                    banks of<br/> the Rapids, for many miles, the roaring of the<br/> Falls is heard
                    resembling distant thunder. Being<br/> in Upper Canada, which is under our own
                    govern-<br/>ment, it felt to me something like being in Eng-<br/>land, and
                    occasioned a pleasing sensation. Here<br/> I observed a number of good
                    farm-houses; the<br/> pastures and the wheat looked remarkably fresh<br/> and
                    green, and a large fine herd of cattle were<br/> grazing in the fields. In
                    conversing I found that<br/> many of the inhabitants are of German or
                    French<br/> descent. In the afternoon I came to Fenning's<br/> Tavern at
                        <a href="/places/chipp1">Chippaway<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a>, a town on the Creek of that<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_153" n="153"></pb> name. Here is a block-house fortification, at which<br/> an
                    English garrison is stationed. From the windows<br/> of this tavern, clouds of
                    mist are seen rising from the<br/> Falls; and the noise of them is so loud, that
                    a per-<br/> son seems to be close upon them, although they<br/> are nearly three
                    miles distant. I was informed by<br/> several of Fenning's family, that the
                    concussion<br/> occasioned by the descent of so large a body of<br/> water, is
                    such, that in a still summer's evening, a<br/> constant tremor of the earth is
                    perceptible; and<br/> the loose glass in the windows is so shaken as to<br/>
                    produce considerable noise.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-12-01">12th Month, 1st</date>. <placename key="niagf"></placename></dateline>
<p>I lodged last night at Fen-<br/> ning's tavern, where I had as good
                    accommoda-<br/>tion as could be desired. In this family I met<br/> with a young
                    man, who had his education in our<br/> society, and is a commissioner or
                    surveyor under<br/> the English government, for the dispose of lands<br/> to new
                    settlers. This young man kindly offered<br/> me his company and assistance, in
                    visiting the<br/> curiosities in this neighbourhood. However it be-<br/>ing
                    first day, and there being no meeting near, I<br/> preferred spending the
                    forenoon alone. There-<br/>fore, immediately after breakfast, I walked down<br/>
                    to the Falls by myself; the tremendous noise, with<br/> the volumes of spray and
                    mist arising from them,<br/> being a sufficient guide to the spot. The
                    first<br/> view of this wonderful cataract, is from the prin-<br/>cipal road,
                    which, though not the most complete,<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_154" n="154"></pb> is perhaps as beautiful
                    as any; but being from a<br/> situation which is level with the river above
                    the<br/> Falls, a considerable part of the cataract is hid from<br/> the eye.
                    After taking a circuit of about a mile,<br/> the path leads down a steep
                    precipice, which is<br/> descended with considerable difficulty, and not<br/>
                    without the aid of a long ladder, placed there by<br/> a neighbouring planter,
                    as when for his own con-<br/> veniency, as for that of strangers.
                    Immediately<br/> below the cataract, the river is confined between<br/> two
                    steep rocks that form a deep winding valley,<br/> through which the waters flow
                    in their course to-<br/> wards Lake Ontario. This valley is terminated<br/> by a
                    perpendicular rock of 53 yards in height,<br/> which runs across, forming angle
                    pointing up<br/> the river, over which this vast body of water
                    pre-<br/>cipitates itself with astonishing rapidity, and with<br/> a noise so
                    tremendous that it can scarcely be de-<br/>scribed. On the top of the rock is a
                    small island,<br/> which divides the cataract into tracts, and in<br/> such a
                    manner that the greater part of the water<br/> pours over the rocks at the
                    extreme head of the<br/> valley; and the rest on one side of it. A little<br/>
                    above, opposite <a href="/places/chipp1">Chippaway<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a>, the river is two
                    miles<br/> over; but directly above the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname>
                    it narrows to<br/> about a mile in breadth. I was informed by<br/>
<a href="/people/jelic1">Joseph Ellicot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a> and his brother, at whose house
                    I<br/> lodged, that they had twice measured the falls, and<br/> found them to be
                    158 feet in height, and about<br/> 1800 yards in width from the opposite edges of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_155" n="155"></pb> the river<note rend="asterisk" resp="transcr">This includes both
                        Falls and the intersecting<br/> island, which is about 450 yards
                        over.</note> I was told by the ferryman, that about<br/> 16 miles above the
                    Falls, the river was nearly one<br/> mile in width, and that, in the middle, it
                    was 40<br/> feet in depth; and, in common, the stream ran<br/> at the rate of
                    six miles in the hour. If this is<br/> really the case, and I have no cause to
                    doubt it,<br/> the quantity of water passing over the Falls, and<br/>
                    continually suspended between the top and bot-<br/>tom, may be more than 400,000
                    tons. If the<br/> additional height and velocity, gained by a fall<br/> of 158
                    feet, be added, the weight of these prodi-<br/>gious columns of water would
                    exceed three mil-<br/>lions of tons. Such an enormous specific gravity<br/>
                    falling at once into the gulf below may bring the<br/> accounts or the Falls
                    being heard, under favour-<br/>able circumstances, at the distance of 40 or
                    50<br/> miles, within the limits of credibility <note rend="asterisk" resp="transcr">Arrowsmith in his map of the United States,<br/> says,
                            <q>this column of water is supposed to descend into<br/> the column
                            about 65 feet.</q> He also observes, <q>It is said by<br/> those who
                            have visited this stupendous cataract, that the<br/> descent into the
                            chasm is very difficult, because of the great<br/> height of the banks.
                            A person having descended, however,<br/> may go to the bottom of the
                            Falls and take shelter behind the<br/> torrent, between the falling
                            water and the precipice; where<br/> there is a space sufficient to
                            contain a number of persons,<br/> in perfect safety; and where
                            conversation may be held with-<br/>out interruption from the noise;
                            which less than at a<br/> considerable distance.</q></note>.</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_156" n="156"></pb>
<p>Having reached the bottom of the precipice,<br/> and approached as near to the
                    cataract, as I could,<br/> with apparent safety, I sat down, and spent
                    about<br/> two hours in contemplating this astonishing natural<br/> curiosity,
                    which is said to be the greatest cataract<br/> in the world. The tremendous roar
                    arising from<br/> the Falls, added to the awful sublimity of the<br/> spectacle
                    of such an uncommon body of water<br/> rushing headlong from the rock, with the
                    beautiful<br/> surrounding perspectives altogether form a scene<br/> which it is
                    impossible to describe. As the morning<br/> was bright and clear, a beautiful
                    rainbow was<br/> constantly observable in the clouds of mist and<br/> spray,
                    that are continually rising from the water<br/> below. Here I held my forenoon
                    meeting, and<br/> though no words were uttered, it could scarcely be<br/> called
                    a silent meeting; the objects before me<br/> loudly proclaiming the power and
                    majesty of the<br/> Great First Cause and Creator of all things.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I returned to the inn, and, after<br/> dinner, was invited by
                    the commanding officer of<br/> the English garrison to drink tea with him,
                    and<br/> his wife and family, in the fort. I accepted his<br/> invitation, and
                    spent the evening with them very<br/> pleasantly. This officer, whose name is
                        <a href="/people/tall1">Tallant<persname key="tall1"></persname></a>,<br/> had spent some time in
                    Sheffield, a few years<br/> back, and had married his wife at Liverpool;
                    she<br/> is an agreeable young woman, and well acquainted<br/> with some friends
                    of Liverpool. They had a fine<br/> child with them, and upon the whole seemed hap-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_157" n="157"></pb>pier than could be expected in such a situation.<br/> They behaved
                    with great kindness to me; and it<br/> appeared a gratification to them to
                    entertain an<br/> Englishman.</p>

<p>This morning I had the com-<br/> pany of W. S. a minister of our society,
                    belonging<br/> to Pelham monthly meeting, in this neighbour-<br/> hood. He
                    kindly invited me to his house, to spend<br/> a few days with him, but I could
                    not conveniently<br/> accept his invitation. In the forenoon I paid<br/> another
                    visit to the Falls, and it being a dark cloudy<br/> day, the whole view had a
                    more gloomy and solemn<br/> aspect. There being none of the glare and
                    glitter<br/> of the sunshine, the eye could rest steadily upon<br/> it; and,
                    having a pencil and paper with me, I<br/> took a sketch of the scene. </p>
<p>In the evening I came to D. P.'s of <a href="/organizations/blacm">Black Creek
                        meeting<orgname key="blacm"></orgname></a>, at whose house I lodged. This is a plea-<br/>sant
                    situation, on the banks of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>; and<br/>
                    D. P.'s establishment presents an agreeable spe-<br/>cimen of a Back Wood
                    family. In the room<br/> where we breakfasted, was a loom for weaving;<br/> in
                    another apartment were spinning wheels, and<br/> some of the girls actively
                    platting straw and mak-<br/> ing it into hats and bonnets for the family.
                    In<br/> addition to our tea and toast, we had excellent<br/> broiled fish taken
                    in the Lake, where they easily<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_158" n="158"></pb> procure great quantities. These persons were so<br/> situated,
                    that, in their own family, they had the<br/> means of procuring nearly all the
                    necessaries, and<br/> even many of the luxuries of life. It was a very<br/>
                    beautiful sight, to see ten fine orderly children<br/> sitting round the table
                    with their father and mo-<br/> ther, who were still in the prime of life, and
                    living<br/> independently of the uncertainties of commerce.<br/> The eldest
                    daughter appeared to be about 16 years<br/> old. One of the sons, who was but a
                    boy, enter-<br/> tained me with full account of his having lately killed<br/> a
                    bear, as it was in pursuit of his father's hogs.<br/> The English government, in
                    order to encourage<br/> the settlement of Upper Canada, grant to new<br/>
                    settlers, 200 acres of land for heads of families,<br/> and 50 acres additional
                    for each child; reserving<br/> to the crown the minerals and the white
                    pines.<br/> D. P. gave me the perusal of his grants, from<br/> which I gathered
                    the conditions. Some little ex-<br/> pense attends the grants in the fees of
                    office,<br/> though but trifling, and their tax amount to a<br/> very small sum
                    per annum for each 100 acres.</p>

<p>I left <a href="/places/blacc">Black Creek<placename key="blacc"></placename></a>; and the<br/> morning being
                    clear and calm, the scenery around<br/> was beautiful. After riding about 10
                    miles on the<br/> banks of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>, I came to
                        <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, where<br/> I got some
                    refreshment at the inn, and proceeding<br/> a little further, I got into the
                    ferryboat, in com-<br/>pany with an old drunken Indian, and his squaw.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_159" n="159"></pb> These poor creatures I had seen the morning be-<br/> fore, at the
                    inn, endeavouring to persuade Fenning,<br/> the landlord, to exchange spirituous
                    liquors for a<br/> piece of printed callico, which the Indian had re-<br/>
                    ceived as a present from the agent of the British<br/> Government in Canada. I
                    was glad to observe<br/> that Fenning had the uprightness to refuse taking<br/>
                    advantage of this poor creature, which he might<br/> easily have done, as the
                    Indian was then in a state<br/> of intoxication, and scarcely able to utter
                    any<br/> thing but <q>Whisko,</q> the name he gave to spirits.<br/> I was told
                    in Canada, that many thousand pounds<br/> per annum are expended in presents to
                    the Indians,<br/> in order to insure their friendship in time of war;<br/> and
                    that the greater part of these presents are ex-<br/>changed for spirituous
                    liquors, which they use to<br/> great excess, many times to the loss of their
                    lives,<br/> and always at the expence of their health. </p>
<p>After crossing the Rapids, I passed through the<br/> Prairies, or large open
                    plains, already described.<br/> In the evening I slept in an inn kept by a
                    person<br/> called Esquire Ransom. This is the title given<br/> to all justices
                    of the peace, and my landlord was<br/> one, and a miller also. It seemed to me a
                    little<br/> strange, that men in such low stations should be<br/> appointed
                    magistrates. On making a remark to<br/> this effect, they also thought it very
                    strange that<br/> we should measure peoples understanding by their<br/> wealth.

<p>I travelled this day mostly<br/> through the woods, and met with some Indian<br/>
                    hunters, who behaved with civility. On one large<br/> tree I saw an Indian
                    painting that had been re-<br/> cently done. The figures were, Indians,
                    bows<br/> and arrows, and deer with arrows pierced through<br/> the neck. The
                    colours were chiefly black and<br/> red, upon the white ground of the tree where
                    the<br/> bark was taken off. In passing through these<br/> woods I saw divers
                    very fine and lofty pines; some<br/> of them were 12 or 14 feet in
                    circumference, and,<br/> I suppose, not less than 170 feet in hight. I saw<br/>
                    many which had been blown down, and, in their<br/> fall, had, with their roots,
                    torn up mounds of<br/> earth of considerable height. At night I came to<br/>
<a href="/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a>, and took up my quarters at the house
                    of<br/> J. E. and his brother, where I was kindly and<br/> generously
                    entertained. We had part of a fine<br/> haunch of venison for supper, which they
                    told me<br/> they had bought of the Indians at 1 1/2d. per lb. and<br/> which
                    was the regular sum paid tor the best parts<br/> of the fattest deer. </p>
<p>In the centre of a good room, in which I slept,<br/> was fixed one of the most
                    beautiful and curious<br/> clocks I have ever seen. It was in the form of<br/>
                    an elegant mahogany pillar, on the capital of which<br/> were four faces. On one
                    of them was an orrery,<br/> shewing the motions of the earth and planets<br/>
                    round the sun. On another face were marked<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_161" n="161"></pb> the hours and minutes; and on the third face were<br/> marked the
                    names of 24 musical tunes, with a<br/> pointer in the centre, which, being
                    placed against<br/> any name, repeated that tune every quarter, until<br/> the
                    pointer was moved to another. On the fourth<br/> face was seen, through the
                    glass, the curious<br/> machinery of the clock. The value set upon this<br/>
                    ingenious piece of mechanism was 1000 dollars,<br/> or 225l. The cabinet work of
                    the casing, as well<br/> as the engravings and paintings about it, and also<br/>
                    the movements, although done in a beautiful and<br/> workman-like manner, had
                    all been executed<br/> by men, none of whom had served an apprentice-<br/>ship
                    to their respective lines of business. The<br/> mechanism was executed by the
                    grandfather of<br/> the kind friend in whose house it stands. This<br/> family
                    are remarkable for ingenuity, and have ren-<br/>dered essential services to this
                    country, by the<br/> improvements they have made in the machinery<br/> of flour
                    mills. One of their progenitors had been<br/> clock-maker to a King of England,
                    and was con-<br/>sidered a first-rate mechanic in his day. Thus<br/>
                    propensities and talents sometimes run in families<br/> from one generation to
                    another. </p>

<p>After breakfast my hospita-<br/> ble friends shewed me into the land office of
                    the<br/> Holland purchase, where every thing is arranged<br/> in great order;
                    and several clerks and surveyors<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_162" n="162"></pb> are employed. At one of the desks I saw<br/> the surveyor whom I
                    had met with a few days<br/> before, in his Indian habiliments, just come
                    out<br/> of the woods, in which he had been surveying.<br/> He was now
                    transformed into a smart looking<br/> clerk, so that I scarcely knew him. In the
                    fore-<br/>noon I left <a href="/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a>, and passed
                    several hunting<br/> parties of Indians. Yesterday, while breakfasting<br/> at
                        <a href="/places/vande">Vandeventer<placename key="vande"></placename></a>'s, I observed them sending
                    out a<br/> boy to a neighbouring settlement of these people,<br/> to buy Indian
                    corn; and, on inquiring the cause,<br/> I was told that in the settlements of
                    the white<br/> people thereabouts, the corn harvest had generally<br/> failed.
                    This not having been the case with the<br/> Indians, the white people were
                    therefore indebted<br/> to them for support that season. The mistress of<br/>
<a href="/places/vande">Vandeventer's Tavern<placename key="vande"></placename></a>, who is a sober
                    religious<br/> woman, informed me that she sometimes employed<br/> the Indian
                    females in needle work, at which some<br/> of them arc exceedingly clever. On my
                    inquiring<br/> how it happened that they decreased in numbers<br/> so fast, she
                    told me that she often had conversation<br/> on this subject, with the females
                    she employed;<br/> and, on close inquiry, they would freely confess<br/> that
                    they used various unnatural means to prevent<br/> an increase. On the landlady
                    pleading with them,<br/> and endeavouring to convince them of the sinful-<br/>
                    ness of their practices, they would sometimes<br/> reply, that it was impossible
                    for them to carry<br/> about a child, and also use the skins, &amp;c. which their<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_163" n="163"></pb> husbands procured in the woods; and which they<br/> were always
                    forced to carry in the hunting season.<br/> Such is the affecting situation of
                    these poor Indian<br/> mothers.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I came to Capt. Ganser's Ta-<br/>vern, in approaching which, I
                    observed a young<br/> Indian female, who was standing not far from the<br/>
                    road, apparently full of trouble. On coming near<br/> the house, I heard a noise
                    very much like the<br/> growling of a wild beast; and on looking into the<br/>
                    house, I saw a stout young Indian singing a kind<br/> of war song in his own
                    language. The master of<br/> the inn told me that he was much intoxicated,
                    and<br/> had been beating his wife, the female I had just<br/> seen. She had,
                    notwithstanding, taken from him<br/> his tomahawk and scalping knife, and put
                    them<br/> out of his way; and I was informed that it is the<br/> general
                    practice of the Indian females, to take<br/> away these instruments of death,
                    whenever there<br/> is any appearance of intoxication. Even the little<br/>
                    girls are so instructed, that whenever they see the<br/> men in the way of being
                    intoxicated, they will slily<br/> take away these instruments and hide them
                    until<br/> the drunken fit is over.</p>
<p>After leaving this place I passed by a settlement<br/> of white people, who were
                    mostly Scotch High-<br/>landers. Here I heard a company of drunken<br/> Indians
                    singing their war song; and, passing on a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_164" n="164"></pb> few miles farther I overtook a company of Indian<br/> women with
                    their children. The women were<br/> disposed to talk with me, but I could not
                    under-<br/> stand a word they said, except <foreign>scos</foreign>,
                        <foreign>scos </foreign>, and <foreign>too<br/> scoss</foreign>; the first
                    of which I knew meant good, and<br/> the latter, not good. Not long after I
                    parted with<br/> them I came to <a href="/places/canaw">Cannawagas<placename key="canaw"></placename></a>,
                    an Indian village,<br/> near the Genessee river, which I crossed, and, in<br/>
                    the evening came to Osmar's Tavern in <a href="/places/hartf2">Hartford<placename key="hartf2"></placename></a>,<br/> where I spent the evening with two young
                    men,<br/> who had also been on a visit to the Falls of Niagara. </p>

<p>This morning I came to<br/> General Hall's inn to breakfast. This repast
                    con-<br/> sisted of tea and toast, and broiled venison. In<br/> the evening I
                    came to <a href="/places/canan">Canandarque<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, and lodged<br/> at
                    Taylor's hotel. </p>

<p>This morning, as I arose,<br/> I saw many Indians, both men and women,
                    com-<br/>ing into the town on business with the shop-keepers;<br/> and, when
                    about mounting my horse, I saw a<br/> beautiful salmon trout borne by two men
                    upon a<br/> pole which was put through the mouth and gills<br/> of the fish. I
                    thought it could not be less than<br/> 4 or 5 feet long, as its tail trailed
                    upon the ground<br/> when thus carried. </p>
<p>In the afternoon I passed through <a href="/places/genev">Geneva<placename key="genev"></placename></a>,
                    and<br/> dined there at Powel's hotel. In the evening I<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_165" n="165"></pb> rode
                    about 8 miles on the banks of <geogname key="lakese">Lake
                    Seneca</geogname>;<br/> and lodged at Captain Knight's tavern, a beautiful<br/>
                    situation on the banks of the Lake. The landlord<br/> informed me that he had
                    been a long time in the<br/> service of <a href="/people/daffl1">Daniel
                        Ofley<persname key="daffl1"></persname></a>, a friend of Philadelphia,<br/> of whom he spoke with
                    respect. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-12-08">2th Month, 8th</date>. <placename key="hecto"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day I travelled along<br/> the Bank of <geogname key="lakese">Lake
                        Seneca</geogname>, on which are many<br/> pleasing prospects. I had,
                    throughout the day, the<br/> company of a young man, a son of the
                    postmaster<br/> Newtown; and, in the evening we came to Ely's<br/> tavern in
                        <a href="/places/hecto">Hector township<placename key="hecto"></placename></a>. One son of our
                    land-<br/>lord was called Hector, being the first white boy<br/> who was born in
                    the town-ship, after its settlement;<br/> he appeared to be about 12 years old.
                    This part<br/> abounds with deer and black squirrels, of which<br/> sort of
                    provisions they had plenty in the house; and<br/> we had some for supper. The
                    squirrels were very<br/> fat, much more so than I could have expected.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-12-09">12th Month, 9th</date>. <placename key="newto2"></placename></dateline>
<p>We left Ely's tavern early, and<br/> passing through a romantic country, where we
                    had a<br/> view of one of the prettiest water falls I had ever<br/> seen. It
                    descended, as by an easy flight of steps, down<br/> the declivity of a mountain,
                    at the foot of which<br/> is <geogname key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogname>. I
                    was told that both the white<br/> inhabitants and Indians kill a great many deer
                    by<br/> hunting them down into the Lake, on which they<br/> continue to pursue
                    them in a boat or canoe. The<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_166" n="166"></pb> pursuers soon overtake the deer, throw a halter<br/> over the
                    horns, and dragging it to the side of the<br/> vessel, take the life of the poor
                    animal with a large<br/> knife, and then drag it on shore. </p>
<p>About noon we reached <a href="/places/catha">Catherines<placename key="catha"></placename></a>, a village
                    at<br/> the end of <geogname key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogname>; at this
                    village there is a<br/> wharf, and some business is carried on in vessels
                    of<br/> about 50 tons burden. After taking some refresh-<br/>ment, we passed on
                    through <geogname key="catswamp">Catherine's Swamp</geogname>,<br/> a deep
                    narrow valley with mountains on each hand,<br/> covered with lofty trees. Here,
                    as the evening<br/> approached the valley resounded with the howling<br/> of
                    wolves; the sound very much resembling the<br/> noise of a number of large dogs,
                    howling as they<br/> sometimes do in the night, or on hearing the sound<br/> of
                    the horn. My companion, by way of encou-<br/>ragement, informed me that he had
                    never heard of<br/> an instance of either a wolf or a bear attacking a<br/> man,
                    except in case of themselves or their young<br/> being first wounded; and from
                    what I can learn,<br/> I believe this statement to be correct. </p>
<p>This evening we came to <a href="/places/newto2">Newtown<placename key="newto2"></placename></a> and had<br/>
                    good accommodations at Ellis's tavern, where I<br/> spent some time with a
                    person of the name of<br/> Goldbride, who informed me that he was the first<br/>
                    person who had attempted the navigation of the<br/> Shoumonge into the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, and so down<br/> to <a href="/places/balti">Baltimore<placename key="balti"></placename></a> and the <geogname key="chesab">Chesapeake
                        Bay</geogname>. In this first<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_167" n="167"></pb> attempt he sustained considerable loss, and several<br/> of the
                    boatmen were drowned; but, from the im-<br/>provements made in the navigation of
                    this river,<br/> considerable business is now done upon it. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1805-12-10">12th Month, 10th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>I left <a href="/places/newto2">Newtown<placename key="newto2"></placename></a>, and, tra-<br/>velling along a
                    thinly peopled country, came to a<br/> small inn kept by one <a href="/people/winc1">Esquire Wincope<persname key="winc1"></persname></a>, where I<br/> got some refreshment.
                    The innkeeper was not<br/> only a justice of the peace, but also a
                    watchmaker.<br/> Having broken the glass of my watch, he put a<br/> brass cap
                    over the face as none of his glasses<br/> would suit. He appeared to be a very
                    ingenious<br/> artist; and as a Magistrate, possessed a good<br/> share of
                    useful knowledge. I perceived an edition<br/> of Burn's Justice on the shelf,
                    with his watch-mak-<br/>ing tools, and therefore I suppose he administered<br/>
                    justice according to law. Towards evening I<br/> came to <a href="/places/tiogp">Tioga Point<placename key="tiogp"></placename></a>, where is the junction of<br/> the <geogname key="shoum">Shoumonge</geogname> with the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>; and took<br/> up my quarters at Doctor Hopkin's, an
                    acquain-<br/> tance of my relation J. E. to whose habitation<br/> at Elklands I
                    was bending my course. This<br/> night I lodged at the Doctor's, and, next
                    morn-<br/> ing set out for <a href="/places/elkla">Elklands<placename key="elkla"></placename></a>. After
                    travelling along<br/> the Bank of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, and passing by<br/>
<geogname key="sugac">Sugar Creek</geogname>, I came to <a href="/places/dothe">Dotherly's tavern<placename key="dothe"></placename></a> in the<br/> evening, on the Banks of
                        <geogname key="tawan">Tawandy Creek</geogname>. Here<br/> I supped, and the
                    next morning breakfasted on<br/> wild venison. </p>

<p>This morning I left <a href="/places/dothe">Dother-ly's<placename key="dothe"></placename></a>, and rode
                    many miles through the woods, with-<br/> out seeing one habitation, or meeting
                    one in-<br/> dividual. The land in general is of good quality,<br/> and the
                    forest trees are mostly beech, hiccory, oak,<br/> a species of pine, called
                    hemlock, and the sugar<br/> maple. From the last, considerable quantities
                    of<br/> sugar are made; and I saw several sugar camps,<br/> fenced in, where the
                    sap is collected in small<br/> wooden troughs, about two feet long,
                    coarsely<br/> made with the hatchet, and capable of containing<br/> one or two
                    gallons each. One of these troughs is<br/> placed at the foot of each tree, and
                    above it a hole<br/> is pierced, with an inch and a half auger. In the<br/> hole
                    is fixed a spout, about one foot long, made<br/> of the elder tree, with the
                    pith taken out. As the<br/> sap is collected, it is carried to the boilers,
                    which<br/> are fixed in the camp. Some farmers not only col-<br/>lect sufficient
                    sugar and treacle for their own<br/> use, but have several hundred pounds weight
                    to<br/> dispose of to the grocers. After travelling about<br/> 12 miles, I came
                    to a habitation called <a href="/places/eldri">Eldridge's
                    Tavern<placename key="eldri"></placename></a>. The situation of this inn was very soli-<br/> tary and
                    romantic, in the midst of a very extensive<br/> forest. The mistress of the
                    house told me that<br/> her husband and she had lately emigrated from<br/>
                    London, where they had carried on business in<br/> Longacre, more than 14
                    years.</p>
<p>In the course of this day I came safe to my<br/> relation's at <a href="/places/elkla">Elklands<placename key="elkla"></placename></a>, and found his family well.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_169" n="169"></pb> The situation he has chosen is very solitary; his<br/> nearest
                    neighbour being about one mile off; but<br/> there are several at about that
                    distance; and some<br/> of them being of our society, they have united<br/> and
                    built a meeting-house near them. </p>

<p>I spent this afternoon at<br/>
<a href="/people/jhain1">J. H.<persname key="jhain1"></persname></a>'s, whose family were busily employed
                    in<br/> making maple sugar. <a href="/people/jhain1">J. H.<persname key="jhain1"></persname></a> is a
                    minister in good<br/> esteem, has an agreeable wife and a group of fine<br/>
                    children, who have plenty of employment in<br/> clearing and cultivating his
                    plantation in this wil-<br/> derness, which, however, appears to be an
                    excel-<br/> lent soil; and the situation being dry and healthy,<br/> on a rising
                    ground, there is every probability that<br/> at some future day this may become
                    a property of<br/> great value. </p>

<p>This day I visited <a href="/people/ehain1">E. H<persname key="ehain1"></persname></a>'s,<br/> a nephew of
                        <a href="/people/jhain1">J. H<persname key="jhain1"></persname></a>'s. He, with his wife and one<br/>
                    fine child, had but lately come into this country,<br/> and had cleared only a
                    very few acres, but which<br/> appeared to be well managed, and very
                    produc-<br/>tive. He had just nailed up the skin of a large<br/> bear, against
                    the side of his house. He had shot the<br/> beast, whilst in the act of seizing
                    one of his hogs,<br/> having been led to the scene of action by the<br/> shrieks
                    of the poor animal, while under the rude<br/> embraces of the bear. By <a href="/people/ehain1">E. H.<persname key="ehain1"></persname></a>'s attention, the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_170" n="170"></pb> tables were quickly turned in favor of the hog,<br/> which was
                    rescued, and was in a fair way of re-<br/>covering from its wounds. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetelk">Elklands meet-ing<orgname key="meetelk"></orgname></a>. During the
                    sitting of it, a company of<br/> hunters came in, and, leaving their rifle guns
                    at the<br/> door, behaved in a becoming manner until the<br/> meeting broke up.

<p>I spent this day at my re-<br/> lation's. In the course of it I saw two of
                    his<br/> men cut down a hemlock tree, which is a species<br/> of pine. This tree
                    was 4 yards in circumference,<br/> and 50 yards in length; yet it was of but
                    little<br/> value here. The timber which most abounds on<br/> this farm is the
                    sugar maple, the beech, the locust,<br/> and the oak. This day I saw a family
                    from near<br/> Derby, in England of the name of Lambert, who,<br/> I understood,
                    were likely to do well. </p>

<p>I rode from <a href="/places/elkla">Elkands<placename key="elkla"></placename></a> to<br/>
<a href="/places/muncy">Muncy<placename key="muncy"></placename></a>, across the <geogname key="allmo">Allegany Mountains</geogname>, in com-<br/> pany with <a href="/people/jhain1">J. H.<persname key="jhain1"></persname></a> and one of his neighbours. When<br/> near the
                    top of the <geogname key="allmo">Allegany Mountains</geogname>, we passed<br/>
                    the company of hunters who had attended the<br/> meeting at Elklands. The
                    principal objects of<br/> their pursuit were deer, although they had no ob-<br/>
                    jection to meeting with a bear or a wolf. In<br/> passing down the <geogname key="allmo">Allegany Mountains</geogname>, we came<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_171" n="171"></pb> near the house of a man of the name of <a href="/people/webs1">Webster<persname key="webs1"></persname></a>,<br/> who had killed 36 bears the last season. </p>
<p>In the evening we came to <a href="/places/muncy">Muncy<placename key="muncy"></placename></a>, where I
                    took<br/> up my lodgings at W. E.'s, a very hospitable friend.<br/> This being
                    the evening preceding the monthly<br/> meeting, upwards of 20 friends lodged at
                    his<br/> house; and, as far as I could judge, were both li-<br/>berally and
                    comfortably entertained. I was told, by<br/> a neighbour, that it was not very
                    uncommon for as<br/> many as 30 strangers to dismount at the door of<br/> this
                    friend's house, in the course of an evening,<br/> and for themselves and horses
                    to be all well ac-<br/> commodated. W. E. has a family of 8 or 10<br/> children,
                    and his wife, who is an amiable woman,<br/> sometimes appears in the ministry.
                    Here I met<br/> with my cousin S. M. who has taken up her abode<br/> at this
                    place for the present. It affords a fine field<br/> for the exercise of her
                    talents; and I believe she<br/> makes herself exceedingly useful. </p>

<p>A deputation from <a href="/organizations/meethalf">Half-moon valley monthly
                        meeting<orgname key="meethalf"></orgname></a>, in Maryland, attended<br/> this <a href="/organizations/muncym">meeting at Muncy<orgname key="muncym"></orgname></a>, with a proposition to unite<br/> these two
                    monthly meetings into a quarterly meet-<br/>ing; the friends of each of them
                    having to travel<br/> about 150 miles to their respective quarterly
                    meet-<br/>ings, according to the present arrangement.</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_172" n="172"></pb>
<p>After attending the monthly meeting, I dined<br/> and spent the afternoon at W.
                    E's, where I had the<br/> company of my relation J. E. and that of many<br/>

<p>I spent this day at W. E's,<br/> who appeared to be much employment as an
                    agent<br/> in the sale and purchase of lands in these parts;<br/> and, I
                    understand, he has, by this means, acquired a<br/> large property. A sale of 100
                    acres of land was<br/> made while I was here. The estate sold for about<br/>
                    330l. sterling, with a tan-yard and some buildings<br/> and other improvements
                    thereon. It was considered<br/> well worth the money; although, 10 or 15
                    years<br/> ago, 50l. would have been thought a good price<br/> for the land; it
                    being 150 miles inland from Phi-<br/> ladelphia; but there are now many good
                    houses<br/> and plantations scattered up and down in the<br/> neighbourhood; and
                    the roads are generally in<br/> good order. </p>

<p>I came this day to <a href="/places/jtown2">Jersey town<placename key="jtown2"></placename></a> where I
                    slept. In passing through the woods<br/> this afternoon, I saw a flock of wild

<p>This morning I came about<br/> 12 miles on my way on the banks of the <geogname key="susqu">Susque-<br/> hanna</geogname> opposite to <a href="/places/catta">Cattawessy<placename key="catta"></placename></a>, and breakfasted at<br/> the house of a friend of
                    the name of <a href="/people/yarn1">Yarnal<persname key="yarn1"></persname></a>.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_173" n="173"></pb> Observing something very wild and singular in the<br/> countenance
                    of an infant, which the friend's wife<br/> was nursing on her lap, I inquired if
                    it was her<br/> own; on which she informed me it was the child of<br/> an
                    Indian, and that she had taken charge of it. </p>
<p>After breakfast I attended <a href="/organizations/meetcat">Cattawessy monthly
                        meeting<orgname key="meetcat"></orgname></a>. Here I took up my quarters at J. L's,<br/> a friend I had
                    before been acquainted with.<br/> J. L. and some of his neighbors were
                    endeavour-<br/>ing to dispose of their property at <a href="/places/catta">Cattawessy<placename key="catta"></placename></a>,<br/> with a view of removing to the Ohio, the tide
                    of<br/> emigration now setting in strongly that way. Gene-<br/>rally speaking,
                    it is observable that local attach-<br/>ments are very slight in this country.

<p>I came to <a href="/places/roari">Roaring Creek<placename key="roari"></placename></a>,<br/> and attended the
                        <a href="/organizations/meetroar">meeting<orgname key="meetroar"></orgname></a> there. Afterwards I<br/> spent the
                    afternoon and lodged at W. P's, having<br/> been kindly invited to his house, by
                    him, when at<br/> J. L.'s. A neighbour of P.'s told us, that, some-<br/>time
                    before, when hunting deer with his dog and<br/> rifle gun, he was suddenly
                    alarmed by a large wolf<br/> running by him. On presenting his gun, he
                    observed<br/> a considerable number following after as fast as<br/> they could
                    run, being in all 17 large wolves. They<br/> all passed by without taking the
                    least notice of<br/> him; however he fired at the last of them, and<br/> killed
                    him on the spot; the rest pursuing their<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_174" n="174"></pb> rout without taking the least notice of their fallen<br/>
                    companion.</p>
<p>In that neighbourhood many friends had sold<br/> their plantations, and had gone
                    to reside in Upper<br/> Canada, where they had each a grant of 2 or 300<br/>
                    acres from the <a href="/organizations/brit">British Government<orgname key="brit"></orgname></a>, without
                    fur-<br/> ther expense than the fees of office, which are very<br/> small, as

<p>I came this day to <a href="/places/mille">Miller's Tavern<placename key="mille"></placename></a>,
                    where, in the evening, I observed a hun-<br/> ter exercising himself in shooting
                    at a mark, with<br/> his rifle gun. The mark at which he shot, was a<br/>
                    lighted candle. The accounts that are given of<br/> the expertness of these
                    shooters, are almost in-<br/> credible. Most of this day's journey was
                    through<br/> a rough, stony country, very little of it being in a<br/> state of
                    cultivation; but the sides of the mountains<br/> were mostly covered with the
                    flowering laurel; and<br/> the streams of the Mahony were seen winding<br/>
                    along the vallies. At the tavern where I dined, there<br/> was a hunter who, the
                    landlord said, had shot one<br/> hundred deer that season.</p>

<p>I came this day to T. L.'s,<br/> at <a href="/places/maide">Maiden
                        Creek<placename key="maide"></placename></a>. Afterwards, at the house where<br/> I lodged, I met with
                    a venerable looking man,<br/> whose countenance was almost lost in a large<br/>
                    bushy beard, which extended a considerable way<br/> down his breast. On
                    conversing with him, it ap-<br/>peared he was of the religious society called<br/>
<a href="/organizations/dunkers">Dunkers<orgname key="dunkers"></orgname></a>. I enquired of him the reason why
                    the<br/> men of their society were so tenacious of their<br/> beards, and
                    expected to have heard some motive<br/> assigned that had at least the
                    appearance of<br/> weight; but in this I was disappointed; for he<br/> either
                    could not, or would not assign any other<br/> than this: <q>That as they
                        believed the practice of<br/> shaving originated from a desire in the men
                        to<br/> make themselves agreeable to the women, it was<br/> unbecoming the
                        gravity of a religious character to<br/> act from such motives.</q>

                    inhabited almost entirely by<br/>
<a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravians<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a>. They have here a
                    well-conducted<br/> boarding-school for girls, where children of all<br/>
                    persuasions are taught every branch of learning<br/> that is deemed necessary
                    for females; and, for this<br/> purpose, the best masters and mistresses are
                    pro-<br/> cured from different parts of Europe and America. </p>
<p>The inn is large and commodious, and conducted<br/> with a good deal of order and
                    regularity; and is<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_176" n="176"></pb> not inferior to some of the principal inns in Eng-<br/> land. Soon
                    after I alighted, I was invited by a<br/> respectable old man to look over the
                    schools that<br/> evening. I was glad of the offer, as I had an op-<br/>
                    portunity of seeing nearly 100 of the girls collected,<br/> and of hearing many
                    of them repeat a number of<br/> short pieces in verse and prose. </p>

<p>I remained in <a href="/places/beth">Bethlehem<placename key="beth"></placename></a>,<br/> and this morning
                    was again kindly invited, by the<br/> person who was my conductor last evening,
                    to go<br/> oven the different apartments in the school and<br/> establishment. I
                    gladly accepted his offer, and<br/> was pleased with the neatness and order
                    that<br/> prevailed throughout the whole. This town is<br/> pleasantly situated

                    by<br/> Count Zinzendorff, and a large tract of good land<br/> was purchased
                    here by him, which is now of very<br/> great value. </p>

                    a single-<br/> horse chaise, and the horse being in high condition<br/> of
                    spirits, took fright at something he saw,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_177" n="177"></pb> and set off on a full gallop: the rein breaking, he<br/> became
                    ungovernable, so that one of the wheels<br/> soon came in contact with a post,
                    on which the<br/> carriage was immediately whirled over, and they<br/> were both
                    thrown out with great violence; but<br/> providentially they received little or

<p>I was employed in my<br/> commercial concerns in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. In passing<br/> along the market-house in this
                    city, the variety of<br/> wild animal food exposed to sale was very
                    striking;<br/> such as bear's flesh, oposums, racoons, squirrels,<br/> deer,
                    badgers, or ground hogs, &amp;c. &amp;c.; besides<br/> a great variety of wild
                    fowls. Many of the latter<br/> were of beautiful plumage, but quite unknown<br/>
                    to me. </p>

<p>I returned to <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>,<br/> and spent the
                    following day there, in writing to<br/> my family and friends in England. I
                    thought it<br/> remarkable, especially at this season of the year,<br/> that,
                    notwithstanding there was a good deal of<br/> plate in constant use, in the
                    house where I lodged,<br/> the doors were never locked at night, nor even
                    had<br/> any locks on them: the only fastening to the prin-<br/>cipal front
                    door, was a nail or a pin put over the<br/> latch; and even this precaution was
                    not unfre-<br/> quently omitted. From what I could learn, it was<br/> generally
                    the practice, in this neighborhood, to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_179" n="179"></pb> leave the doors unlocked, although the town stood<br/> upon one of
                    the most public turnpike-roads in<br/> America, only about 7 miles from
                    Philadelphia, a<br/> city containing considerable more than one hun-<br/> dred

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion Preparative Meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>,
                    where a discussion of a rather singular<br/> nature took place, by which it
                    appeared that, ad-<br/> joining to Friend's burying ground, there is ano-<br/>
                    ther grave yard, set apart by Friends, for the use<br/> of people of other
                    persuasions who incline to bury<br/> in it. For many years past, a number of
                    the<br/> neighbouring families had availed themselves of<br/> the privilege; but
                    not satisfied with burying only,<br/> they had taken down nearly the whole of
                    the stones<br/> which composed the wall that separated the two<br/> grave yards;
                    and had placed them at the head and<br/> feet of the graves, by way of
                    tomb-stones, and thus<br/> the two burying groups had nearly become one.<br/>
                    Many Friends of the Preparative Meeting thought<br/> it was necessary to build
                    up the partition wall, whilst<br/> others were for having the remains of this
                    wall<br/> entirely taken away. However, as it appeared on<br/> discussion, that
                    persons of other persuasions were<br/> in the practice of using certain
                    ceremonies at<br/> their burials, and of erecting tomb-stones, &amp;c. it<br/>
                    was at length concluded that it would be right to<br/> rebuild the wall, in
                    order that the peculiar testi-<br/>monies of Friends, in these respects, might be<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_180" n="180"></pb> more clearly manifested; and the wall was accord-<br/>ingly
                    ordered to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>In conversation with H. B. he<br/> related to me an affecting narrative of a
                    black boy,<br/> who came under the observation of his brother J. R.<br/> and
                    resided near his dwelling at Lewis-Town, in<br/> Delaware State. It happened
                    that the master of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_181" n="181"></pb> this poor lad had missed a piece of leather, and he<br/> charges
                    the boy, who was his slave, with stealing<br/> it. The boy denied the charge.
                    However, as<br/> the master was unable to discover what was be-<br/>come of the
                    leather, and looked upon the denial<br/> of the charge as a thing of course, he
                    was very<br/> much irritated that he was unable to bring any proof<br/> against
                    the lad. In order to extort confession, the<br/> master tied him up by the
                    hands, a considerable<br/> height from the ground, and fixed a heavy piece<br/>
                    of wood (a fence rail) to his feet. In this situa-<br/> tion he beat the poor
                    boy in so unmerciful a man-<br/>ner, that he died under the torture thus
                    cruelly<br/> inflicted by his brutal master. Scarcely had the<br/> poor little
                    innocent breathed his last, under<br/> these torments, before the master's son,
                    smitten<br/> with remorse on being the occasion of such<br/> dreadful cruelties,
                    confessed that it was himself<br/> who had stolen the leather, for which the
                    poor<br/> little slave had just paid the forfeit of his life.<br/> However void
                    of the feelings of humanity, it may<br/> well be supposed, that this
                    hard-hearted master<br/> was not a little mortified at having wantonly put<br/>
                    to death a valuable slave; but, such was the pro-<br/>tection which that State
                    afforded these oppressed<br/> fellow-creatures, that the master escaped
                    punish-<br/>ment, as is commonly the case on occasions of<br/> murder committed
                    by the whites on their black<br/> slaves. </p>

<p>On a retrospect of my tra-<br/> vels in this continent, I could not avoid
                    recalling<br/> to mind the beauty and grandeur of the surround-<br/>ing scenery,
                    which I have so often admired; whe-<br/> ther in looking down from the Allegany
                    Mountains<br/> upon vast forests, extending, on every hand, as far<br/> as the
                    eye can reach; or in wandering along the<br/> banks of those extensive lakes in
                    the Genessee<br/> Country, and Upper Canada, in the midst of<br/> which, the
                    stupendous cataract of Niagara stuns<br/> the ear. Equally impressive was the
                    scene in<br/> sailing on those majestic rivers, the Delaware,<br/> the Hudson,
                    the Patowmack, or the Susquehanna,<br/> whose ever-varying banks open prospects
                    extremely<br/> wild and beautiful; or in traversing those almost<br/> boundless
                    forests which still remain in an unculti-<br/>vated state, where I often beheld
                    the native Indian<br/> families rambling in search of game. In all these<br/>
                    changing scenes, however striking and impressive,<br/> the recollection of my
                    near connexions at home<br/> was almost ever with me; and the remembrance<br/>
                    of these tender ties induced a short address to my<br/> wife and family, which
                    led me to exhibit the ef-<br/> fects of divine love in a few additional
                    stanzas.<br/> Though they may have little to recommend them,<br/> I insert the
                    lines in this place:--</p>
<floatingtext type="poem">
<p> Tho far divided, still I feel thee near,<br/> And oft, on thee,
                            remembrance loves to dwell,<br/> As on a friend well tried, and doubly
                            dear,<br/> Whose worth my heart can better feel than tell.<br/>
</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_183" n="183"></pb>
<p> Thro' all thy conflicts, may the hand of power,<br/> Lead thee in safety
                            on the devious way;<br/> And match around thee, thro' each varying
                            hour,<br/> Thy guard and guide unto the latest day.<br/>
</p>
<p> Those tender plants the pledges of our love,<br/> True to themselves, as
                            to known duty true,<br/> By thy example led, oh! may they prove,<br/>
                            The joys of virtue; and her paths pursue.<br/>
</p>
<p> As oft, at early dawn, or evening's close,<br/> These widely, waving
                            woods, I pensive trace,<br/> This tender wish within my bosom
                            flows,<br/> In love unbounded still by time or space.<br/>
</p>
<p> Not this Atlantic's vast extended flood,<br/> Encircling many an Isle in
                            his embrace;<br/> Nor these wide forests that have ages stood,<br/> A
                            shade and shelter to an Indian race;<br/>
</p>
<p> Not all the deeps where oceans waves combine,<br/> With ev'ry forests
                            broad extended space,<br/> More widely spread than does that love
                            divine,<br/> Which, as it flows, embraces every race.<br/>
</p>
<p> With its mild influence cloth'd, the mind can view,<br/> All human kind
                            with one benignant eye;<br/> Whate'er their nation, or whate'er their
                            hue,<br/> For suffering man the heart can heave a sigh.<br/>
</p>
<p> Behold yon slave with wretchedness cast down,<br/> Torn from his wife
                            and children's weeping eye,<br/> He toils unpitied in a land
                            unknown,<br/> And eats his bitter bread with many a sigh.<br/>
</p>
<p> Free and untainted, from its source sublime,<br/> Tho' the pure current
                            of the gospel flows;<br/> Yet what avails it to this favour'd
                            clime,<br/> If man, obdurate still, no pity knows!<br/>
</p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_184" n="184"></pb>
<p> Or what avails it, tho' fair freedom rear,<br/> Her beauteous throne
                            upon a fertile land,<br/> If there ten thousands still the chain must
                            wear,<br/> And, unregarded, lift the suppliant hand!<br/>

<p>I spent this day at <a href="/places/phila">Philadel-phia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. In
                    crossing the floating bridge at the upper<br/> ferry, I observed the people
                    engaged in a singular<br/> kind of harvest, being employed in breaking up<br/>
                    and taking away large quantities of ice, to lay up<br/> for summer use. Those

<p>In crossing the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> on<br/> the floating
                    bridge, at the upper ferry, I passed a<br/> Negro boy apparently about 12 years
                    of age.<br/> Round his neck an iron collar was locked, and<br/> from each side
                    of it an iron bow passed over his<br/> head. His dress was a light linsey jacket
                    and<br/> trowsers, without hat, shoes, or stockings. Soon<br/> after passing the
                    boy, whom I supposed to be a<br/> runaway slave, I met a person of whom I
                    inquired<br/> the reason of the boy is having so much iron about<br/> him. The
                    man replied that the boy was his, and<br/> was so often running away that he had
                    used that<br/> method to prevent him. </p>

<p>After having passed several<br/> days at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, chiefly in writing to my family<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_185" n="185"></pb> and connexions, I went this day to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,<br/> and forwarded various letters and papers to
                    Eng-<br/> land. Afterwards I dined at J. A.'s, an English-<br/> man, who had
                    often kindly invited me to his house.<br/> He had been sent to this country by
                    D. B. on<br/> business. J. A. gave me an account of singular<br/> preservation
                    experienced by the ship's company<br/> in crossing the Atlantic, when more than
                    500<br/> miles from land. His narrative was nearly as<br/> follows:--Lying awake
                    early one morning, he was<br/> alarmed by the people's continuing a long time
                    at<br/> the pump. About five o'clock the Captain came<br/> down and informed him
                    that the ship had sprung<br/> so considerable a leak, that he was fearful
                    the<br/> consequence would be serious, for the water gained<br/> fast upon them;
                    that in all probability it would not<br/> be many hours before the vessel would
                    sink, and<br/> that there was no alternative but taking to the long-<br/>boat.
                    Preparations were accordingly made to<br/> leave the ship, by providing the few
                    stores and<br/> necessaries they were able to stow in the boat.<br/> While this
                    was doing the water increased so rapidly,<br/> that, early in the forenoon, it
                    filled the lower hold<br/> and began to make its appearance on the cabin<br/>
                    floor. About noon all were under the absolute ne-<br/>cessity of leaving the
                    ship, from an expectation she<br/> would go down every moment. With this awful
                    pro-<br/> spect before them, the ship's company committed<br/> themselves to the
                    waves, with scarcely a ray of hope<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_186" n="186"></pb> of ever reaching the land. The afternoon was spent with<br/> heavy
                    hearts, being every moment in danger of hav-<br/>ing their boat overset or
                    filled with water. When<br/> the darkness of the night came on, it added to
                    the<br/> horror of their situation. However, soon after<br/> it was dark, about
                    eight o'clock, the Captain stood<br/> up, and being stiff with long sitting in a
                    confined<br/> posture, stretched himself out, with his face to-<br/> wards that
                    part of the horizon, where the moon<br/> was at that moment rising and casting a
                    stream of<br/> light along the surface of the waters. This afforded<br/> him an
                    opportunity of discovering a vessel which,<br/> providentially, at that very
                    time, was passing be-<br/> tween them and the moon just as she rose above
                    the<br/> waves. The prospect of so unexpected a deliver-<br/>ance, gave such new
                    strength to the poor sailors<br/> at the oars, that, in a short time they came
                    up<br/> with the ship, and were all taken safely on board. </p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the feelings of a grate-<br/>ful mind, on an occasion
                    like this; but from such<br/> an event, we may all draw this useful lesson:
                    not<br/> to be too much discouraged even under the most<br/> adverse
                    circumstances of life. </p>

<p>I left <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>,<br/> and this day, <date when="1806-02-01">the 1st of 2d Month</date>, I crossed the<br/>
<geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname> to <a href="/places/charl">Charleston<placename key="charl"></placename></a>, and thence came to<br/>
<a href="/places/bush">Bush<placename key="bush"></placename></a>. Here I rested about an hour at an inn,
                    the<br/> landlord of which told me that he was a native of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_187" n="187"></pb> London, and had received his education in Christ<br/> Church
                    Hospital. On coming over to America<br/> about 60 years ago, he landed near the
                    place where<br/> Baltimore now stands; but, at that time, the town<br/> was not
                    begun, altho' it now contains near 30,000<br/> inhabitants, and is one of the
                    best built towns I have<br/> seen. Indeed I do not know any in England su-<br/>
                    perior to it in beauty. In the evening I came to<br/> an elegant inn called the
                    Stone-house, and the next<br/> day reached <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, and it being 1st day, I at-<br/> tended the <a href="/organizations/meetbalt">meeting<orgname key="meetbalt"></orgname></a> there. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">

<p>I attended the <a href="/organizations/meetbalt">quarterly meet- ing<orgname key="meetbalt"></orgname></a> at
                        <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, which was held in the
                    new<br/> meeting-house, a very handsome brick building,<br/> about 50 yards in
                    length and proportionably broad.<br/> It cost nearly 6000l. This meeting-house
                    is so con-<br/> structed, that both men and women keep their seats<br/> when the
                    meetings for worship close, which are held<br/> previously to proceeding to
                    their respective busi-<br/> ness. The partition which divides the house
                    into<br/> two parts, is so constructed, that it winds round a<br/> windlass with
                    flat sides. The pannels of the par-<br/> tition are joined to teach other by
                    hinges; are so<br/> proportioned that they wrap round the windlass as<br/> truly
                    and regularly as a piece of canvas; and are<br/> so nicely managed, that in
                    winding up or letting<br/> down, they make no more noise than a common<br/>
                    curtain. It is obvious that the first range of pan-<br/>nels at the top, next to
                    the windlass, must be the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_188" n="188"></pb> narrowest; and that they must gradually increase<br/> in breadth
                    to the lowest range, otherwise they<br/> could not wrap regularly round the
                    axle. The<br/> gradual decrease in the breadth of the pannels has<br/> a very
                    pretty effect, when the shutters are down;<br/> and, contrary to my expectation,
                    I did not observe<br/> that the meeting suffered any inconveniency from<br/> the
                    voices of the women, in the other division of<br/> the house. </p>

<p>This day I visited a friend, his<br/> wife, and family, who in company with
                    several<br/> others had lately emigrated from the neighbour-<br/>hood of Pyrmont
                    in Germany. Their object in<br/> coming to America, was, that they and their
                    chil-<br/> dren might have more of the company of friends.<br/> As the wages of
                    the poor are very low in that part<br/> of Germany, not exceeding 3d. or 4d. per
                    day,<br/> and the necessaries of life are high in proportion,<br/> few labourers
                    there can afford to have any thing<br/> better than coarse rye or barley bread,
                    sprinkled<br/> with a little salt, to their tea or coffee; and these<br/>
                    Germans, being all labouring people in low cir-<br/>cumstances, found a great
                    alteration in their situ-<br/> ation every way, and appeared very thankful
                    for<br/> the change. </p>

<p>In the course of the day I vi-<br/> sited a family of friends, who had lately
                    emigrated<br/> from Amsterdam, of the name of Poppeleim, and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_189" n="189"></pb> who had come to this country with the same views<br/> as the
                    Germans just mentioned; but, being men<br/> of property, were engaged in
                    business. These<br/> friends having been eye witnesses of the ravages of<br/>
                    war, which of late have so desolated some of the<br/> finest countries in
                    Europe, often expressed their<br/> thankfulness, in broken English, that they
                    were<br/> permitted thus to sit down in a land, where peace<br/> and plenty so
                    generally prevailed. One of the last<br/> mentioned family, of the name of
                        <a href="/people/vpopp1">Valentine<persname key="vpopp1"></persname></a>, a man<br/> of a very delicate
                    constitution, and who had suf-<br/> fered a great deal through bad health, and
                    the<br/> almost constant state of alarm his country had<br/> been kept under for
                    years past, by contending<br/> armies, used sometimes to say to his brothers:<br/>
<said who="vpopp1">How thankful ought we now to feel for being<br/> thus placed
                        amongst friends: we can sleep peace-<br/> fully in our beds, and, rising in
                        the morning, we<br/> can pursue our business without interruption or<br/>
                        alarm; and can sit down in a land of plenty, eating<br/> our bread in
                        quietness and peace.</said> This evening<br/> I supped with I. P. an English
                    friend, who some<br/> years back had emigrated from York, and is now<br/> well
                    settled in business here. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetbalt">Baltimore week-day meeting<orgname key="meetbalt"></orgname></a>. In
                    the afternoon I set out for <a href="/places/wash">Washing-ton
                        city<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, in company with E. W. and slept this<br/> night at his
                    house near <a href="/places/elkri">Elkridge<placename key="elkri"></placename></a>, where he has a<br/>
                    valuable estate, and a large well constructed flour<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_190" n="190"></pb> mill. During the continuance of the war car-<br/> ried on by Great
                    Britain, in this country, he<br/> was tried with the loss of all his property,
                    and a<br/> long confinement in prison; but his integrity and<br/> perseverance
                    rose above all his difficulties; and he<br/> is now placed in a situation of
                    life far above most<br/> of his persecutors. </p>

<p>I left E. W's hospitable roof,<br/> and, in the evening, came to <a href="/places/blade">Bladensburg<placename key="blade"></placename></a>, where<br/> I had the company of a young
                    surgeon to supper,<br/> of the name of <a href="/people/jbell2">John
                        Bell<persname key="jbell2"></persname></a>, who had accompanied<br/> the American squadron in the late
                    expedition<br/> against the Dey of Tripoly, and was at the storm-<br/>ing of the
                    fort and town of Deane, on the coast<br/> of Africa. In hearing narratives of
                    this kind, the<br/> mind is often lost in astonishment in the
                    consi-<br/>deration that a man, endowed with reason, can<br/> bring himself to
                    believe there is any thing meri-<br/> torious in thus exposing his life and
                    limbs to de-<br/> struction, and oftentimes when he is a total<br/> stranger to
                    the causes of the quarrel which he has<br/> espoused. How lamentable is it that
                    the noblest<br/> faculties of man should be debased, and the funda-<br/> mental
                    principles of the christian religion trodden<br/> underfoot, through the
                    indulgence of ferocious and<br/> warlike dispositions. </p>

<p>In travelling this day, I passed<br/> by a company of black slaves, chained together,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_191" n="191"></pb> with a white man of a savage countenance, holding<br/> a large
                    pistol in his hand, driving them before him.<br/> Behind was a cart, in which
                    were some Negro<br/> children, who had been torn from their parents by<br/> this
                    member of civilized and polished society, who<br/> was now taking them down into
                    Georgia, there<br/> to remain in abject slavery for life. In viewing<br/> this
                    painful scene as it passed before me, it was<br/> almost impossible to avoid
                    noticing how different<br/> were the countenances on the infant company in<br/>
                    the cart, compared with that of their unfeeling<br/> conductor. On the former
                    were seen the smiles<br/> of innocence, whilst on the latter sat brooding<br/> a
                    mixture of cruelty and avarice, which no pen or<br/> pencil can describe. </p>
<p>In the afternoon I came to <a href="/places/wash">Washington
                    city<placename key="wash"></placename></a>;<br/> and on the 9th I attended the meeting at <a href="/organizations/meetwdc">Wash-ington<orgname key="meetwdc"></orgname></a>. After meeting I was kindly invited by<br/>
<a href="/people/mpayn1">M. P.<persname key="mpayn1"></persname></a> to her son-in-law's house, who is
                    Secretary<br/> of State; but, having engaged to spend the after-<br/>noon
                    elsewhere, I was obliged to decline the offer.<br/> In the evening I had the
                    company of a native of Fal-<br/>mouth; but, of late years, he has been employed
                    in<br/> the national dock-yard at Washington city, as naval<br/> architect. I
                    understood that he had, early in life,<br/> been invited over to this country
                    Doctor<br/> Franklin, as one skilled in ship-building. Having<br/> had his
                    education in our society, it appeared in-<br/>consistent that he should be
                    employed in con-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_192" n="192"></pb>structing ships of war; but I found he had forfeited<br/> his
                    membership. However, I am mistaken, if the<br/> building of ships of war is not
                    a burden greater<br/> than he will be able long to bear. A friend of<br/> the
                    name of J. A. supped with us this evening.<br/> He was from Providence in Rhode
                    Island, and<br/> gave us an interesting narrative of a journey he<br/> took
                    through the wilderness parts of this continent,<br/> to New Orleans in
                    Louisiana. A considerable<br/> part of the way he went by water in canoes,
                    hav-<br/> ing Indian conductors, and passed through many<br/> Indian
                    settlements, by the chiefs of which he<br/> was, in general, kindly and
                    hospitably entertained.<br/> At one Indian village in particular, the
                    chief,<br/> calling together the inhabitants to a place where<br/> they held
                    their public meetings, and placing<br/> Jonathan by his side, made a long
                    harangue. The<br/> substance of it was, his approbation of the prin-<br/>ciples
                    and practices of friends, concerning which<br/> he had obtained information at
                    some former pe-<br/>riod, and which he then endeavoured to explain<br/> to the
                    Indians about him. Amongst other things<br/> he remarked, it was a self-evident
                    truth, that the<br/> Power which gave life and breath to man, alone<br/> had the
                    right to take it. At another settlement<br/> of Indians, he was agreeably
                    surprised to find<br/> what great progress was made in agriculture and<br/>
                    manufactures. He was told, that in this district<br/> there were 200 looms
                    employed by Indians; and<br/> at the table of the chief at which he was enter-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_193" n="193"></pb>tained, there was every kind of vegetables and<br/> fruit common in
                    the cities of America; such<br/> as pease, beans, cabbages, asparagus,
                    melons,<br/> peaches, &amp;c. At dinner, amongst other things, a<br/> quarter of
                    roasted lamb was served up; a thing<br/> hardly to have been expected at an
                    Indian table. </p>

<p>This morning I visited S. B.<br/> at his office in the Treasury, of which he is
                    the<br/> head clerk. From the Treasury I was kindly<br/> conducted by J. P. to
                    his mother's, who was<br/> then resident with her son-in-law, <a href="/people/jmadi1">J. M.<persname key="jmadi1"></persname></a> the pre-<br/> sent Secretary of State to the
                    United States. I<br/> spent a little time pleasantly with the Secretary,<br/>
                    who was confined to his house, by a hurt he had<br/> received upon his knee; and
                    although pretty much<br/> a stranger in the family, I received a kind
                    invita-<br/> tion to call at his house, whenever business might<br/> lead me to
                    Washington city. </p>
<p>As I had never seen <a href="/people/tjeff2">Thomas Jefferson<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a>, the<br/>
                    President of the United States, this hospitable<br/> family offered to introduce
                    me to him, and the<br/> Secretary's brother-in-law accompanied me to the<br/>
                    President's house, where I was received by him<br/> with a shake by the hand, as
                    though we had been<br/> old acquaintance; and immediately he entered into<br/>
                    conversation with as much freedom as if we had<br/> been long known to each
                    other. After sitting a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_194" n="194"></pb> short time in this friendly way, I informed him,<br/> that as my
                    object in calling upon him, deserved<br/> scarcely a better name than curiosity,
                    I should be<br/> very sorry to detain him; especially as his time<br/> must be
                    fully occupied with the important con-<br/> cerns of <a href="/organizations/usag">Government<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>; Congress being then sitting.<br/> After this, rising
                    from my chair, he came forward,<br/> and again taking me by the hand, bade me
                    farewell.<br/> From his disregard to all useless forms and cere-<br/> monies,
                    not excepting these of religion, his ene-<br/> mies accuse him of being
                    deficient both in religion<br/> and politeness. But there are men, that
                    have<br/> seen a great deal of the world, who believe, on<br/> good grounds,
                    that where true religion and true<br/> politeness most abound, there we see
                    least of<br/> forms and ceremonies, and that true religion and<br/> true
                    politeness generally go hand in hand. </p>
<p>Having received an invitation from one of the<br/> Members of Congress, to attend
                    their sitting, I<br/> this day went to the Capitol and heard their de-<br/>
                    bates. I also visited the Hall where the Senate<br/> was sitting; but as there
                    was nothing very interest-<br/>ing before them, I had not an opportunity of<br/>
                    hearing their principal orators. </p>
<p>After visiting the Senate and House of Repre-<br/>sentatives, I spent a short
                    time in the Supreme<br/> Federal Court; where the <a href="/people/jmars2">Chief
                        Justice<persname key="jmars2"></persname></a> was then<br/> sitting. Although a great part of the

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_195" n="195"></pb> already finished, in a convenient, and indeed, in a<br/> superb
                    style, yet a great deal remains to be done<br/> before the whole will be

                    gave me an affecting account of a black slave,<br/> residing near his house, who
                    is a pattern of inte-<br/> grity and industry. Such is the confidence re-<br/>
                    posed in him by his master, that for many years<br/> past it has been his
                    practice to send this slave to<br/> Baltimore, with his waggon laden with
                    various<br/> kinds of produce, the sale of which he intrusts to<br/> this black
                    man; also the care of receiving and<br/> bringing home the money; by which means
                    it fre-<br/> quently happens that large sums of money pass<br/> through his
                    hands. This service he has performed<br/> so much to the satisfaction of his
                    master, that he<br/> scarcely ever ventures to employ any other person<br/> for
                    these purposes. </p>
<p>This faithful slave has a wife and a large family<br/> of children, who reside in
                    a hut close by his mas-<br/>ter's house. He is allowed a small portion of
                    time<br/> weekly to do something for himself and family;<br/> and being
                    frequently employed by the neighbours<br/> to do little errands for them in
                    Baltimore, he has,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_196" n="196"></pb> during many years of care, and frequently by hard<br/> labour when
                    others were at rest, scraped together<br/> about 200l. He lately made an offer
                    of all this<br/> to his master for the freedom of his family; but<br/> the
                    master absolutely refused to give him his liberty<br/> on any condition,
                    alleging that he could not meet<br/> not meet with another in whom he could so
                    confide. </p>
<p>The poor man had greatly flattered himself with<br/> hopes, that considering his
                    time of life, being now<br/> about 50 years old, a much smaller sum would
                    have<br/> procured his liberty; and it would indeed have pur-<br/> chased that
                    of almost any other slave in the neigh-<br/> bourhood. On finding his master
                    inexorable, his<br/> disappointment and distress were extreme, and, in<br/> the
                    anguish of his heart, he determined to leave<br/> his wife and children, and
                    take the first opportu-<br/> nity of quitting the country for ever. However<br/>
                    he concluded first to call on E. W. who had<br/> always been his friend and
                    adviser, to inform him<br/> of his resolution. E. W. sympathized with him<br/>
                    in his affliction, but did not let that suffice; for he<br/> went immediately to
                    the master, and used every<br/> endeavour to prevail upon him to accept the<br/>
                    money offered, and, to grant the man and his<br/> family their freedom. In order
                    to induce the mas-<br/> ter's compliance, E. W. represented to him the<br/>
                    exceedingly ungenerous return he was making to<br/> the poor man for his
                    fidelity and industry; as the<br/> only plea urged by this unfeeling master, for his<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_197" n="197"></pb> cruel conduct, was the uprightness and integrity<br/> of the
                    Slave!! But, alas! avarice is deaf to all<br/> arguments except those of
                    self-interest; it was<br/> therefore in vain that E. W. thus pleaded the<br/>
                    cause of suffering virtue; for the hardened task-<br/> master was inexorable to
                    all his reasonings; and<br/> the poor black man and his family remain in
                    bon-<br/> dage, living witnesses to what a pitch of obduracy,<br/> avarice and
                    self-interest can harden the heart of<br/> man. As nothing that E. W. could say
                    had any<br/> effect upon the master, he thought it his duty to<br/> endeavour to
                    reconcile the poor slave to a hard<br/> lot, and to persuade him not to leave
                    his wife and<br/> family, as it appeared his full determination to<br/> have
                    done. In this he was more successful; for<br/> the poor man concluded to remain
                    with them, and<br/> endeavour to bear his burden with patience. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetbalt">Baltimore monthly meeting<orgname key="meetbalt"></orgname></a>, and
                    afterwards dined at J. M.'s,<br/> a friend who after many years successful
                    applica-<br/> tion to business, had retired from it, and was em-<br/> ploying a
                    part of his leisure hours, in promoting<br/> an extensive work for supplying the
                    town with<br/> water, in which he has embarked considerable pro-<br/> perty
                    conjointly with many others. I took a walk<br/> with him to view the work as it
                    was in progress,<br/> and, from what I could judge, it will be attended<br/>
                    with very great expense; but no doubt it will prove<br/> highly beneficial to

<p>I visited <a href="/people/gpopp1">G. P.<persname key="gpopp1"></persname></a> one of the<br/> friends lately
                    come from Amsterdam to settle in<br/>
<a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. They had opened a shop here
                    which<br/> they had furnished with the manufactures of<br/> France and Germany;
                    and for the short time they<br/> had been in business, had met with good
                    encou-<br/> ragement. I was rather surprised to see that in<br/> some of the
                    shops in this place, as well as in Phi-<br/> ladelphia, although nearly the
                    whole stock con-<br/> sisted of the manufactures of other countries, yet<br/>
                    but little of it was from England. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetbalt">Baltimore forenoon meeting<orgname key="meetbalt"></orgname></a>, and
                    in the afternoon attended by J. T.<br/> and G. M. left that city. In the evening
                    we came<br/> to <a href="/people/hjudg1">H. J.<persname key="hjudg1"></persname></a>'s, a minister who is
                    well respected in this<br/> neighbourhood. His house and plantation lie
                    near<br/> the <geogname key="gunpo">Gunpowder Falls</geogname>, and not far from
                    the meet-<br/> ing which bears that name. I was told of a re-<br/> markable
                    preservation which the friends of this<br/> meeting experienced during the
                    revolutionary war<br/> in America. As our society generally had shewn<br/> an
                    attachment to the government of England, at<br/> the breaking out of the
                    revolution, and had, as a<br/> body, adhered to their peaceable principle in
                    re-<br/> fusing to take and active part in the struggle, there<br/> were many
                    amongst the most violent of the revolt-<br/> ing colonists, who were greatly
                    exasperated against<br/> friends. However a few individuals in the society,<br/>
                    were not so careful as in common prudence they<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_200" n="200"></pb> ought to have been; and several of them were<br/> accordingly
                    tried, convicted, and executed, as<br/> traitors to their country. The conduct
                    of these<br/> of imprudent individuals, increased the disgust of<br/> those
                    violent partizans, and it sometimes happened<br/> that innocent friends were
                    dragged from their<br/> meeting-houses to prison. At that period, a part<br/> of
                    the American army lay near the Gunpowder<br/> Falls meeting-house, which,
                    however, did not pre-<br/>vent friends from holding their meetings for
                    wor-<br/>ship. Amongst the troops of which this part of<br/> the army was
                    composed, there was a Colonel of a<br/> regiment of dragoons, whose resentment
                    against<br/> friends was raised to such a pitch of malice, that<br/> one day,
                    when traversing the country, he came to<br/> the most extraordinary and cruel
                    resolution of<br/> putting to the sword, the friends who were then<br/>
                    collected at their place of worship; considering<br/> them as no better than a
                    company of traitors.<br/> Drawing up his men near the spot, he ordered<br/> them
                    to halt, in order to make arrangements for<br/> the execution of his dreadful
                    purpose. At this<br/> moment an awful silent pause took place, in<br/> which he
                    felt his mind so powerfully smitten<br/> with conviction that he not only drew
                    off his<br/> men, but conceived very favourable sentiments of<br/> the society;
                    and continuing to yield to his convic-<br/>tions, he afterwards joined in
                    communion with<br/> friends, and continued faithful to the principle of<br/>
                    truth as professed by them.</p>

<p>This morning we passed by<br/>
<a href="/places/notth">Nottingham<placename key="notth"></placename></a> meeting house, in the
                    neighbourhood<br/> of which <a href="/people/jchur1">John Churchman<persname key="jchur1"></persname></a>
                    formerly resided.<br/> About noon we came to S. C.'s to dinner, where<br/> we
                    had the company of <a href="/people/mstro1">Mary Stroud<persname key="mstro1"></persname></a>, one of
                    the<br/> fifteen children of <a href="/people/jgilp1">Joseph Gilpin<persname key="jgilp1"></persname></a>,
                    mentioned by<br/> by <a href="/people/tchal1">Thomas Chalkly<persname key="tchal1"></persname></a> in his
                    Journal, page 313, Edit.<br/> 1766. This friend was in very low
                    circumstances<br/> at the time <a href="/people/tchal1">Chalkly<persname key="tchal1"></persname></a> first
                    visited him, and<br/> his habitation was a cave by the side of a moun-<br/>
                    tain; although many of his descendants, at this<br/> time, are people in
                    opulence in America. The<br/> cave is now in the possession of one of them,
                    at<br/> whose house I was once hospitably entertained,<br/> and who considers it
                    as reflecting honour upon the<br/> family, rather than as being any
                    disparagement to<br/> it. <a href="/people/mstro1">Mary Stroud<persname key="mstro1"></persname></a>,
                    although about 100 years old,<br/> still retained her faculties in an
                    extraordinary<br/> manner, and her observations were often shrewd<br/> and
                    pointed. </p>

<div type="entry">

<p>I attended the <a href="/organizations/meetwestq">quarterly meet-ing at London
                        Grove<orgname key="meetwestq"></orgname></a>, the closing sitting of which,<br/> was one of the largest I
                    ever was at. W. J. and<br/>
<a href="/people/rmott1">R. M.<persname key="rmott1"></persname></a> two valuable American ministers,
                    were<br/> here; the latter of whom appeared in an extraor-<br/> dinary manner,
                    and being a young man of an<br/> amiable disposition, and pleasing delivery, he
                    will,<br/> I trust, continue a useful ornament in the church.<br/> Yet how
                    frequently do we see the fairest hopes<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_202" n="202"></pb> and prospects troubled; sometimes by the unwise<br/> attentions
                    and adulations of the admiring crowd.<br/> It is greatly to be lamented, that
                    even those who<br/> in an especial manner are placed as guardians and<br/>
                    overseers of the shepherds, are not altogether clear<br/> of fanning that little
                    spark of vanity, which the<br/> grand enemy contrives, in one form or other,
                    to<br/> light in almost every human breast. </p>
<p>On coming out of the house after the breaking<br/> up of these meeting, I was
                    surprised at the great<br/> number of horses and carriages standing on the<br/>
                    ground before the meeting-house. The space<br/> they occupied consisted of
                    several acres; and, from<br/> the best judgment I was able to form, there
                    were<br/> nearly 200 carriages of different descriptions,<br/> mostly on
                    springs, and more than double that<br/> number of horses, exclusive of those
                    used in the<br/> carriages. The trifling expense at which horses<br/> and
                    carriages are kept in the <emph rend="italic">country parts</emph> of Ame-<br/>
                    rica, enables even those in slender circumstances<br/> to keep them, which
                    certainly is a great privilege<br/> in warm climates. After this meeting I took
                    my<br/> leave of several of my friends, never expecting to<br/> see them again
                    on this side of the grave. </p>
<p>I spent part of this afternoon with J. P. an agree-<br/> able friend, who had
                    devoted some years to the in-<br/> struction of the Indians in letters and
                    agriculture,<br/> &amp;c. and had been long amongst them in their settle-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_203" n="203"></pb>ments. He related a variety of little anecdotes<br/> concerning
                    these untutored sons of the forest, cha-<br/> racteristic of their habits and
                    manners, from which<br/> it seemed, that the restraints and confinement of<br/>
                    mechanics and labourers in civilized life, are con-<br/> sidered by them as the
                    greatest of human miseries;<br/> and that one nation should even wish to
                    spread<br/> their manufactures amongst other nations, and thus<br/> become
                    labourers to those for whom they have no<br/> knowledge or regard, was, in their
                    eyes, the height<br/> of human folly. </p>
<p>As the plan in which J. P. was engaged did<br/> not profess to interfere with the
                    religious concerns<br/> of the Indians, they were not often a subject of<br/>
                    conversation with; yet the Indians would some-<br/> times observe, that they
                    should have no objec-<br/> tion to attending Friends' meetings, if it were
                    not<br/> too long to sit doing nothing, without the privilege<br/> of a pipe.
                    Instances, however, have occurred,<br/> amongst such untutored individuals,
                    wherein they<br/> have evinced conviction that the Great Spirit may<br/> be
                    known and worshipped in silence. </p>
<p>On my arrival at S. P.'s, I found his wife in a<br/> poor stage of health; and
                    although considerably<br/> reduced by sickness, yet her natural lively and<br/>
                    cheerful disposition seemed to rise superior to her<br/> bodily affliction. She
                    made respectful mention of<br/> number of European friends, who had visited<br/>
                    her habitation; particularly M.R. and J.W.;<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_204" n="204"></pb> the manners of the latter, and her dialect, in broad<br/> Irish,
                    had entertained her very much.</p>
<p>While in this family, I could not avoid noticing<br/> the innocence and
                    simplicity of a little Negro<br/> boy, named <a href="/people/sado">Sado<persname key="sado"></persname></a>; and on my making some in-<br/>quiry, <a href="/people/mpain1">Martha Painter<persname key="mpain1"></persname></a> gave an account to the<br/> following
                    effect:--Importing Negro slaves from<br/> the coast of Africa, is contrary to
                    the laws of the<br/> United States, notwithstanding some of the<br/> Southern
                    States allow the keeping of slaves, and<br/> it sometimes happens that an
                    American ship is<br/> detected transgressing the law, in which case both<br/>
                    ship and cargo are confiscated. Not long since,<br/> two American ships with
                    cargoes of slaves were<br/> seized by a frigate belonging to the United
                    States,<br/> and brought to the Port of Philadelphia, where<br/> they were both
                    condemned; but the poor black<br/> people on board were put under the care of
                    the<br/> Society instituted for the Abolition of the Slave<br/> Trade, and were
                    all provided with places as ser-<br/> vants or apprentices. Amongst the latter
                    was<br/> little <a href="/people/sado">Sado<persname key="sado"></persname></a>, who was put out to S. P.
                    Although<br/> he was treated with the greatest tenderness, yet he<br/> was often
                    seen weeping at the recollection of his<br/> near connexions. He said, that
                    himself and sister<br/> were on a visit to a relation's, and that, after
                    the<br/> family had retired to rest, they were suddenly<br/> alarmed, in the
                    dead of the night, by a company<br/> of Man-stealers breaking into their habitation.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_205" n="205"></pb> They were all carried off towards the sea, where<br/> they arrived
                    at the end of three days, and were<br/> confined until the vessel sailed.
                        <a href="/people/sado">Sado<persname key="sado"></persname></a>'s sister was<br/> placed in a situation
                    near S. P.'s, which afforded<br/> them frequent opportunities of seeing each
                    other.<br/> Not long after this Negro boy had been brought<br/> into S. P.'s
                    family, he was taken ill of a bad fever;<br/> and, for a time, there appeared
                    but little hopes of<br/> his recovery, although the best medical help was<br/>
                    obtained, and every kindness and attention was<br/> shewn to him. While he laid
                    in this state, M. P.<br/> inquired of him, if there was any thing he wished<br/>
                    to have, or if there was any thing she could do<br/> for him; as they desired to
                    do every thing in their<br/> power to relieve him. In reply, he expressed
                    his<br/> thankfulness for their good intentions, but said,<br/>
<said who="sado">There was nothing they could do that would<br/> cure him; yet
                        if he was at home with his mother,<br/> she would soon make him well;</said>
                    adding that <said who="sado">there<br/> was a plant grew in his country, the
                        leaves of<br/> which she gathered, and poured hot water upon<br/> them,
                        covered his body all over with them, and it<br/> always soon made him
                        well.</said>
<a href="/people/mpain1">Martha<persname key="mpain1"></persname></a> desired him<br/> to prescribe the
                    plant, and they would endeavour to<br/> procure it. He replied, <said who="sado">It was not to be had in<br/> this country, for he had often looked for it
                        in<br/> vain.</said>
</p>
<p>There being now scarcely any prospect of his<br/> recovery, his mistress was
                    desirous of administer-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_206" n="206"></pb>ing some religious consolation, and observed to<br/> him, as he had
                    always been a very good boy, she<br/> had no doubt that if he died at this time,
                    his<br/> spirit would be admitted into a place of everlast-<br/> ing rest and
                    peace. On hearing this, he quickly<br/> replied, <said who="sado">I know; that
                        if I die I shall be happy;<br/> for as soon as my body is dead, my spirit
                        will fly<br/> away to my father and mother, and sisters and<br/> brothers,
                        in Africa.</said> The boy recovered. His<br/> good conduct had gained him
                    the favour and re-<br/> spect of the whole family, and I have no doubt<br/> that
                    the care bestowed upon his education, will,<br/> in due time, afford him a
                    brighter prospect of a<br/> future state, than that of returning to Africa. </p>
<p>I have sometimes turned my attention to the<br/> orderly conduct, and pleasing
                    dispositions of some<br/> of these Black children, whom I have seen in<br/>
                    friends families. On considering that they have<br/> been violently torn from
                    their near relatives and<br/> friends, and exposed to all the horrors and
                    sick-<br/> ness of transportation in a slave ship; I have<br/> compared them
                    with the kidnappers, and with the<br/> owners, captains, and crews of slave
                    ships, who<br/> assume the name of Christians, and, with the<br/> greatest
                    self-complacency, make pretensions to<br/> being governed by the precepts and
                    example of<br/> Christ; whilst they give the appellation of Hea-<br/> thens and
                    Infidels to these poor unoffending Negro<br/> children, as a cover to their
                    cruelty. In such a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_207" n="207"></pb> contemplation and comparison, the mind is over-<br/> whelmed with
                    sorrow, at the idea of the atrocity<br/> and darkness in which human nature may
                    be in-<br/> volved, by the unbounded thirst of gold. </p>

<p>I left S. P.'s hospitable roof<br/> accompanied by his brother-in-law J. T.
                    The<br/> ground I travelled over this day was the scene of<br/> much bloodshed
                    during the revolutionary war; it<br/> being that part of the country where the
                    bat-<br/> tle of Brandywine was fought. My companion<br/> was present at the
                    time, with several other<br/> friends, who were led forth by the dictates of
                    hu-<br/> manity, in order to lend some assistance to the<br/> poor wounded and
                    dying soldiers, that lay scat-<br/> tered over the fields, through an extent of
                    several<br/> miles. On this occasion friends meeting-house of<br/> Birmingham
                    was converted into an hospital, in<br/> which many of the poor mangled creatures
                    breathed<br/> their last, and where many more suffered the am-<br/> putation of
                    their limbs, with many other pain-<br/> ful operations concomitant with the
                    carnage of<br/> war. Amongst those who ended their earthly<br/> course in this
                    meeting-house, were several officers,<br/> who were buried in friends burying
                    ground. One<br/> of them, a near connexion of the Duke of North-<br/> umberland,
                    was a young man of the name of<br/> Percy, whose amiable and exemplary
                    conduct<br/> under his severe sufferings, had procured him the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_208" n="208"></pb> particular regard and esteem of the friends about<br/> him. The
                    shocking situation of some they found<br/> in the fields, would not bear
                    description; in others<br/> who lay lifeless on the ground, it was some
                    time<br/> before any wound could be discovered, a single<br/> bullet having
                    passed through some vital part;<br/> others had the fleshy part of a leg or a
                    thigh torn<br/> to pieces by larger balls, and had sunk under the<br/> loss of
                    blood. </p>
<p>These scenes of horror were followed by others,<br/> if possible, still more
                    revolting to human nature.<br/> Those who have travelled much in America
                    must<br/> have observed the deep channels that are in many<br/> places worn in
                    the declivities of their fields, owing<br/> to the great depth of soil and the
                    heavy showers<br/> to which they are subject in that country. It so<br/>
                    happened that the dead bodies of many of those who<br/> were slain in this
                    battle, were interred in these chan-<br/> nels, and remained so for some time
                    undisturbed;<br/> but, afterwards, some heavy rains falling, the earth<br/> was
                    washed away, and many of the dead bodies<br/> were again exposed to view in a
                    putrid state. </p>
<p>After spending an hour or two at <a href="/places/wches">West
                    Chester<placename key="wches"></placename></a><br/> we came to S. J.'s, where we dined and spent the<br/>
                    rest of the day. At this friends house, <a href="/people/lagn1">General
                        L'Agneau<persname key="lagn1"></persname></a> made his head-quarters for some time<br/> before the
                    battle of Germantown, where he lost<br/> his life. That part of the English army
                    under his<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_209" n="209"></pb> command was encamped in S. J.'s fields and<br/> orchard, round
                    about the house. </p>

<p>This morning I came to J. K.'s<br/> habitation and spent a few hours with him in
                    con-<br/> versation respecting my friends in England, he<br/> having lately
                    returned from a visit to that nation. </p>

<p>I slept last night at W. T.'s,<br/> and this day went over J. T.'s estate, where
                    I vi-<br/> sited the old family mansion, which was erected<br/> on the first
                    settlement of this country. In many<br/> parts of America, and particularly in
                    this neigh-<br/> bourhood, it is the practice of many farmers to<br/> reserve
                    about 15 or 20 acres of land for hay,<br/> which they continue to mow from one
                    generation<br/> to another, many of them laying on but little or<br/> no manure;
                    but taking the advantage of situation,<br/> where the land may easily be
                    irrigated or over<br/> spread with water from time to time. By this<br/> means
                    they obtain heavy crops of grass without<br/> the aid of manure, and thus supply
                    themselves<br/> with winter fodder at an easy expense. On in-<br/> quiry of W.
                    T. and P. P. two very respectable<br/> farmers and land-owners, they informed me
                    that,<br/> upon an average, they got about 2 1/2 tons per acre<br/> each year,
                    upon this plan. The land usually<br/> chosen for this purpose is not a dead flat
                    or<br/> marshy land, but commonly the two sides of a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_210" n="210"></pb> narrow valley of easy ascent on each hand, having<br/> a small
                    stream running through the bottom. When<br/> the land is to be watered, the
                    stream at the upper<br/> end of the valley is diverted from its natural
                    bed,<br/> and is conducted in narrow channels along each<br/> side of the valley
                    on as high ground as the head<br/> of the stream will admit; and, by placing
                    obstruc-<br/> tions to the current of the streams, in different<br/> parts of
                    the artificial channels, the water continues<br/> to trickle down the sides of
                    the valley, so as plen-<br/> tifully and regularly to water the roots of
                    the<br/> grass, but not in such quantities as to cover the<br/> herbage. </p>
<p>In the course of the day we paid A. S. a visit,<br/> and in that evening came to
                    A. H.'s, another<br/> brother-in-law to J. T. Here I met with one of<br/> the
                    oldest copies of the English Bible I had ever<br/> seen; it was translated by
                    Coverley, at a period<br/> when the sacred volume was not divided into
                    chap-<br/> ters and verses, and both the language and the<br/> type bore evident
                    marks of great antiquity. The<br/> word shoes I noticed was always spelled
                    shoon,<br/> and righteousness was always spelled rightwiseness,<br/> and in many
                    other respects the language was so<br/> very different from what it is at this
                    day, as scarcely,<br/> in many places, to be like the same tongue. </p>
<p>During part of the revolutionary contest, this<br/> friend's house was the
                    head-quarters of General<br/> Stirling, and, sometimes, consultations were held<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_211" n="211"></pb> here by the American General Officers, at which<br/>
<a href="/people/gwash1">General Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a> attended. While the
                    armies<br/> lay in this neighbourhood, the farmers suffered<br/> severely in
                    their property; one instance of which<br/> this friend mentioned to me, as
                    descriptive of the<br/> situation of things amongst them;--A near neigh-<br/>
                    bour, who had a considerable stock of cheese on<br/> hand, which it was found
                    needfull to hide to pre-<br/> vent being plundered of it, was in hopes an
                    op-<br/> portunity might occur when it might be sold at a<br/> fair price, and
                    to a regular customer; but it so<br/> happened, that some officers who were
                    encamped<br/> in the vicinity, had got some information respecting<br/> this
                    stock of cheese. One of them sent a servant<br/> to the mistress of the house,
                    who stated, that his<br/> master was extremely anxious to taste one of her<br/>
                    cheeses, having been told that she made a better<br/> article than any of her
                    neighbours, and that not<br/> having tasted any of a long time that was fit
                    to<br/> eat, he would freely give her a guinea for a small<br/> one. However the
                    servant was not able to ascer-<br/> tain the fact, and of course returned
                    without<br/> accomplishing his errand. Upon this the officer<br/> went himself
                    to the house, and, after a deal of<br/> persuasion, prevailed upon the mistress
                    to furnish<br/> him with two or three, for which he very freely<br/> gave her a
                    guinea each. </p>
<p>He had watched the mistress so closely, that he<br/> discovered where the stock
                    of cheese was laid up,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_212" n="212"></pb> without appearing to have observed whence she<br/> brought the
                    cheeses for him. After many expres-<br/> sions of thankfulness, that be had been
                    supplied<br/> with such an excellent article, he returned to the<br/> camp; but
                    the result was, that, next day, a party of<br/> armed soldiers came to the
                    house, and, after forci-<br/>bly taking the money which the officer had paid
                    the<br/> day before, they went to the room where the<br/> cheese was kept, and
                    carried the whole out, with-<br/> out paying any thing for it. Such is the
                    morality<br/> of war!</p>

<p>We rode to W. J.'s house,<br/> at <a href="/places/wgrove">West Grove<placename key="wgrove"></placename></a>,
                    to breakfast; and after attending<br/> their meeting, spent the afternoon at his
                    house, in<br/> pleasant conversation with himself and his wife,<br/> who is an
                    agreeable cheerful woman. W. J. gave<br/> me a little history of the emigration
                    of his family<br/> into this country, from Ireland:--Being in very<br/> low
                    circumstances, they were glad to put up with<br/> what way then considered the
                    worst lot of land in<br/> that part; and on their first coming here they
                    were<br/> visited by a friend who was already settled, and<br/> had got his
                    house built, and his land in a state of<br/> cultivation. This friend being
                    touched with com-<br/>passion, went home and told his own family how<br/> deeply
                    he felt for the poor Irish family, who, he<br/> feared would never be able to
                    get bread to sup-<br/>port themselves, the land was so very indifferent;<br/>
                    and taking out a bushel of malt, sent it to them to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_213" n="213"></pb> make a little beer to support their spirits under<br/> their
                    discouraging prospect. Such is the altera-<br/>tion that has taken place, that,
                    at this time, the land<br/> which was then thought insufficient for the
                    support<br/> of one family is now divided into several planta-<br/>tions or
                    farms, each of which is considered as<br/> amply sufficient for the support of a
                    family in<br/> ease and even in affluence. One of these plan-<br/>tations is
                    that now belonging to W. J. and on<br/> which he resides. </p>
<p>This night I lodged at P. P.'s. Here also I<br/> met with a smart little Negro
                    boy, who had been<br/> stolen from his parents in Africa, and was placed<br/> in
                    this family by the Abolition Society. He had<br/> the character of being a boy
                    of a bright capacity;<br/> and although not very communicative to his<br/>
                    master and mistress, he was open and free with<br/> the children of the family,
                    and would often, by<br/> the fireside in the winter evenings, recite to
                    them<br/> the mournful story of his being made captive; with<br/> many shocking
                    circumstances that attended his<br/> transportation in the slave ship; from
                    which he<br/> was liberated by an American ship of war. </p>
<p>After breakfast I set out for <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, in
                    com-<br/> pany with I. J. and in my way passed by the front<br/> of Westown
                    school. By his school is managed upon<br/> a plan somewhat similar to that at
                    Ackworth, but<br/> with this difference, that the children of friends in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_214" n="214"></pb> affluent circumstances are not excluded. The<br/> number of
                    scholars in the house is generally<br/> about 200, including boys and girls. </p>
<p>In the evening I came to <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a> where I
                    found<br/> letters from my family and friends, as late as the<br/> 27th of
                    12th;Month which contained the pleasing<br/> account of their being all well.

<p>Being the first of the week I<br/> attended meeting in the forenoon, and spent
                    the<br/> evening at H. B.'s, where I had the company of<br/> his father and
                    mother, and R. J.; the latter being<br/> far advanced in years, of an active
                    lively disposi-<br/> tion and having a retentive memory, would fre-<br/> quently
                    favour me with little anecdotes of the first<br/> settlers in the neighbourhood,
                    which he had re-<br/> ceived from the parties themselves, in the early<br/> part
                    of his life. Amongst the rest he related a<br/> little story which he had heard
                    from an ancient<br/> friend at whose house he had lodged, of the name<br/> of
                    Rebecca Wood. When a little girl she used<br/> sometimes walk from Derby, where
                    she resided,<br/> to Haverford meeting, the distance of a few miles.<br/> One
                    day she was walking along she was over-<br/> taken by a friend on horseback, who
                    proved to be<br/>
<a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a>. On coming up with her he
                    in-<br/> quired where she was going; and on her inform-<br/> ing him, he, with
                    his usual good nature, desired<br/> her to get up behind him; and, bringing his horse<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_215" n="215"></pb> to a convenient place, she mounted, and so rode<br/> away upon the
                    bare back. Being without shoes<br/> or stockings, her bare legs and feet hung
                    dangling<br/> by the side of the governor's horse. Although<br/> William Penn
                    was at this time both governor<br/> and proprietor, he did not think it beneath
                    him<br/> thus to help along a poor bare footed girl on her<br/> way to meeting,
                    and notwithstanding the maxims<br/> and customs of the world, these little kind
                    offices<br/> to those in low stations in life, were so far from<br/> lowering
                    him in the estimation of those he was<br/> appointed to govern, that there
                    perhaps never was<br/> a governor, who stood higher in the opinion of<br/> those
                    governed by him, than <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> did. </p>
<p>In repeating this anecdote, the old friend ge-<br/> nerally concluded her story
                    with the observation,<br/> that, <q>there were no such governors now-a-days.</q>

<p>I had the company of O. and<br/> J. J. the latter of whom related to me a
                    tran-<br/> saction of his, when but about 14 years of age,<br/> which manifested
                    a considerable degree of firm-<br/> ness in one so young. At the time of the
                    revolu-<br/> tion, a neighbour was condemned to death tor his<br/> attachment to
                    the English government. Under<br/> these melancholy circumstances, the near
                    connex-<br/> ions of the sufferer, were anxious that the body of<br/> their
                    unhappy relative, should be decently interred<br/> in the family burying ground
                    at Merion; but con-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_216" n="216"></pb>sidering to what pitch of indignation the minds<br/> of the people
                    were raised against him, it appeared<br/> to be a very hazardous task to take
                    the body from the<br/> place of execution, surrounded by the great crowd<br/> of
                    spectators who were there assembled, to be<br/> witnesses of the last struggles
                    of their devoted<br/> countryman. However, J. J. although but a boy,<br/>
                    undertook the task, and proceeding through the<br/> multitude, without any
                    attendant, went up to the<br/> executioner, and demanding the body, brought
                    it<br/> off in a hearse, himself being the driver; and con-<br/> ducted it
                    safely to the relatives of the deceased.<br/> His youth and the singularity of
                    the circumstance,<br/> seemed to command the respect of the multitude. </p>

<p>I came from <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> to<br/>
<a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>. The sun now having considerable
                    power,<br/> I was struck with the loud chirping noise, that<br/> issued from
                    every little pond or pool of water, as<br/> I passed along, which, I was
                    informed, proceeded<br/> from a species of lizard that inhabits those
                    places,<br/> and is commonly the first of the animal creation<br/> to usher in
                    the spring. The chirping of these<br/> lizards in the spring, and of the
                    tree-frog in sum-<br/> mer, form no inconsiderable part of the rural<br/> sounds
                    we are accustomed to hear in America;<br/> to which might be added the notes of
                    various other<br/> kinds of frogs; particularly of the deep toned bull<br/>
                    frog, which in a still summer's evening, when the<br/> wind has been favourable,
                    I have sometimes heard<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_217" n="217"></pb> at the distance of more than a mile. Although<br/> these sounds
                    are strange to an English ear, yet<br/> there is something in them which is far
                    from be-<br/> ing unpleasant. </p>

<p>In the forenoon I attended<br/>
<a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>, and spent the afternoon at R.
                    J.'s,<br/> who entertained me with an account of the man-<br/> ner in which
                        <a href="/people/ppemb1">Phineas Pemberton<persname key="ppemb1"></persname></a> and his wife,<br/> first
                    became acquainted with each other; and they<br/> being the first of that family
                    who came to America,<br/> the story was interesting:--<a href="/people/ppemb1">Phineas<persname key="ppemb1"></persname></a>, when a boy,<br/> was an apprentice to a grocer in
                    Manchester, and<br/> I believe the house in which he lived is still stand-<br/>
                    ing, as J. P. one of his descendants, on his late visit<br/> to England, had the
                    curiosity to take a look at it,<br/> when in that neighbourhood. It happened, on
                    a<br/> market-day, that whilst Phineas was serving the<br/> customers, there
                    came in a country friend and his<br/> daughter, of the name of Harrison, to
                    purchase<br/> groceries for the family; and as they waited to be<br/> served,
                    the daughter, who was but a little girl,<br/> employed herself in eating
                    cherries out of a small<br/> basket she had brought with her. As soon as<br/>
                    Phineas was at liberty, he furnished the friend and<br/> his daughter with the
                    groceries they wanted; and<br/> the little girl having some of her cherries
                    to<br/> spare, gave them to Phineas. Pleased with her<br/> generosity, he
                    insisted upon her taking a paper of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_218" n="218"></pb> raisins in return. From this trifling circumstance,<br/> an
                    attachment originated which ended but with<br/> their lives. They were united in
                    marriage when<br/> of a suitable age; soon after which they emigrated<br/> to
                    America, and afterwards became the heads of<br/> one of the most respectable
                    families in Philadel-<br/> phia. The young woman's father also went over<br/> to
                    America with them. </p>
<p>In recurring to the little story of <a href="/people/ppemb1">Phineas Pem-
                        berton,<persname key="ppemb1"></persname></a> we have an example of the instability of<br/> things in
                    this changing scene. It is but a very<br/> few years past that several branches
                    of this family,<br/> seemed to stand foremost in rank both in the so-<br/>
                    ciety, and in the American world in general; and<br/> there was every
                    probability that the name and<br/> family might continue numerous and
                    respectable<br/> for many generations. But, if I recollect right, at<br/> the
                    time I am writing, <a href="/people/jpemb1">James Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>, who
                    is<br/> now about 84 years of age, is the only remaining<br/> branch of the
                    family who bears the name; and if<br/> he should be the last, it may be truly
                    said, that the<br/> sun of the family has gone down in brightness.<note rend="asterisk" resp="editor">See Note, page 46.</note>

<p>I came to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, where<br/> I supped
                    and spent the evening at <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>'s,<br/>
                    an ancient valuable friend, a native of Leicester.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_219" n="219"></pb> He left England in early life, along with his pa-<br/> rents, who,
                    having imbibed favourable sentiments<br/> of America, had bidden a final
                    farewell to their<br/> native land. In the recollection of this friend, I<br/>
                    have often thought that the general tenor of his<br/> life and conversation,
                    possessed as much of what<br/> I should call sterling Christianity, as I have
                    ever<br/> observed in any other man. In him were seen the<br/> innocence and
                    simplicity of a child, although he<br/> was a man of considerable literary
                    attainments and<br/> reputation in the world. Through life he had<br/> been an
                    active and able advocate of the enslaved<br/> Africans; and, though not backward
                    in giving a<br/> sentiment on the passing public transactions of the<br/> day,
                    he was far from being a busy-body in matters<br/> of this kind; and such was the
                    religious subjection<br/> into which his mind was brought, that, in
                    lamenting<br/> or approving the measures of those in authority,<br/> it was done
                    with a meekness and calmness, which<br/> evinced that he was biassed by no
                    narrow, party<br/> spirit in the observations he made; but that they<br/> were
                    the effusions of a heart <q>which felt and<br/> cared for all.</q> Being an
                    industrious man, and suc-<br/>cessful in business, he had the means, as well
                    as<br/> the inclination, of serving his friends and strangers.<br/> Frequent
                    opportunities of the latter offered in this<br/> city, where emigrants from
                    almost every nation<br/> in Europe, are often arriving.</p>

<p>I was accompanied by <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> to A
                    W.'s, at whose house we supped and<br/> spent the evening. A. W. some years
                    since, ac-<br/> companied <a href="/people/jparr1">J. P.<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> on a religious
                    visit to friends at<br/> Pyrmont, and was with him in that place when he<br/>
                    departed this life, in the assurance of a happy<br/> eternity. On A. W.'s
                    return, he had to pass<br/> through a part of the country occupied by the<br/>
                    allied army, then engaged in its operations against<br/> France. He was seized
                    and taken before the<br/> commanding officer, who took great offence at his<br/>
                    plain language, and not taking off his hat; and,<br/> after a good deal of
                    abusive language, struck him<br/> to the ground. Afterwards, when A. W. had
                    time<br/> given him to explain who and what he was, the<br/> General appeared
                    extremely ashamed of his con-<br/>duct, and extorted a promise from him, that
                    he<br/> would not expose him on account of this cruel<br/> and unworthy
                    behaviour towards a peaceable<br/> stranger. For this reason, in repeating the
                    story,<br/> he always avoided giving the name of the General. </p>
<p>After passing the limits of the German lines,<br/> he soon came within those of
                    the French army,<br/> commanded by <a href="/people/more1">General
                        Moreau<persname key="more1"></persname></a>, and was taken<br/> before him by some of the soldiers on
                    the out-<br/>posts; but here he was treated with great kind-<br/> ness, and a
                    passport was given him, which enabled<br/> him to pursue his journey without
                    further molesta-<br/>tion. About the time that I am writing, <a href="/people/more1">General
<persname key="more1"></persname></a> being exiled to America by the French<br/>
                    Emperor, A. W. has had an opportunity of ac-<br/>knowledging, and of returning
                    his kindness. The<br/>
<a href="/people/more1">General<persname key="more1"></persname></a> has taken up his residence about 20
                    miles<br/> from Philadelphia, having his wife and family<br/> with him. Several
                    friends paid a good deal of<br/> attention to them, on a count of his humane
                    and<br/> generous conduct. Thus this little act of genero-<br/>sity to an
                    unprotected stranger, proved the cause of<br/> many kind attentions to himself
                    and family, when<br/> the scene was changed, and when he, from being a<br/>
                    victorious General, commanding a powerful army,<br/> was become an exile in a
                    foreign land. This little<br/> history affords a useful lesson to men in power.

<p>I supped and spent the even-<br/> ing at R. B.'s, at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, and observed in his<br/> yard a Negro of an interesting
                    countenance. On<br/> inquiring who he was, H. B. informed me, that a<br/> few
                    days ago the poor man came up from Dela-<br/> ware State, and, at the
                    recommendation of his<br/> brother, H. B. had taken him into his family for<br/>
                    protection. At the same time he related to me<br/> the following
                    narrative:--Some time since the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_222" n="222"></pb> master of this black slave died, leaving behind him<br/> a widow,
                    and one son, a profligate young man.<br/> As the master lay on his death-bed, he
                    called<br/> this faithful slave to him, and taking him by the<br/> hand, told
                    him that he felt his end was fast ap-<br/>proaching, and that his mistress would
                    have little<br/> to depend upon for her support, except what she<br/> might be
                    able to make of his labour; and there-<br/>fore he begged that he would continue
                    to be faith-<br/> ful to her, after the master should be laid in the<br/> silent
                    grave. In a very short time the master<br/> died, and the slave continued his
                    services to his<br/> mistress, and much to her satisfaction; enabling<br/> her,
                    for several years, to live comfortably, and also<br/> to administer to the wants
                    of her profligate sun;<br/> so that, under a grateful sense of his worth,
                    she<br/> determined to make this black man free, and also<br/> his family,
                    consisting of a wife and three children.<br/> A writing was accordingly drawn
                    up, and duly<br/> executed, whereby they were all liberated; and the<br/>
                    happiness of this family, under these circumstances,<br/> may be more easily
                    conceived than described. </p>
<p>Their industry and sobriety, manifested whilst<br/> in bondage, now had its full
                    effect; and all went<br/> on happily and comfortably, until the profli-<br/>
                    gate son, before mentioned, who had by idleness<br/> and drunkenness reduced
                    himself to extreme ne-<br/>cessity, conceived the cruel plan of
                    invalidating<br/> the indenture with his another had executed, to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_223" n="223"></pb> give this worthy Negro family their liberty; and<br/> actually
                    sold the father, mother, and the three<br/> children, to a company of Georgia
                    slave dealers,<br/> who were then in the neighbourhood. They being<br/>
                    conscious that the young man had no right thus<br/> to sell the family, had
                    determined to take them<br/> away in the dead of the night, to preclude the
                    pos-<br/> sibility of applying to any magistrate for pro-<br/> tection. However,
                    the Negro had got some<br/> intimation of what was going forward, and, in<br/>
                    consequence, kept loaded fire arms in his house,<br/> being determined to shoot
                    any person who should<br/> attempt to break into his habitation. These pre-<br/>
                    cautions being known to the slave dealers, they,<br/> for some time, did not
                    venture to molest him;<br/> but he and his wife being soon wearied with
                    liv-<br/>ing in this state of anxious suspense, consulted a<br/> fellow Negro,
                    in whom they placed confidence, as<br/> to their best method of proceeding; and
                    it was<br/> concluded that the whole family should leave that<br/> part of the
                    country, and settle in Pennsylvania, as<br/> soon as possible; where they would
                    be out of the<br/> reach of the slave dealers. </p>
<p>No sooner was this determination come to, than<br/> their perfidious friend, for
                    the sake of a trifling<br/> reward, went to the Georgia slave traders, to
                    betray<br/> the whole family into their hands; and, in the mid-<br/> dle of the
                    night, they were seized, bound, and forci-<br/>bly taken from their comfortable
                    habitation, in order<br/> to be put on board a small sloop which lay in the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_224" n="224"></pb> river, near at hand. On coming near the river, the<br/> poor black
                    man, who had been placed on horse-<br/>back, behind one of these Georgia men,
                    suddenly<br/> broke loose, and leaping from the horse, plunged<br/> headlong
                    into the river, which he quickly swam<br/> across, and, getting into the woods,
                    escaped from<br/> his inhuman pursuers. On this occasion, the agi-<br/> tation
                    of the poor wife and children was beyond<br/> expression; and to silence the
                    shrieks and cries of<br/> this miserable family, these unprincipled men
                    beat<br/> them unmercifully; and the last with the poor<br/> Negro man saw of
                    this scene, as he fled into the<br/> woods, was their beating his wife upon the
                    head,<br/> in the most brutal manner. To a person who has<br/> not been an
                    eye-witness to such scenes, it may ap-<br/>pear incredible that transactions of
                    so attrocious<br/> nature, could occur under a form of government<br/> like that
                    of the United States; but the slavery of<br/> the Negroes having long since been
                    introduced,<br/> the evil consequences resulting from it have not<br/> yet been
                    rooted out of the Southern States; where<br/> a warm climate seems to have
                    enervated both the<br/> bodies and the mind of the white inhabitants. It<br/>
                    is, however, to the credit of the people of Pennsyl-<br/>vania, and the States
                    to the eastward and north-<br/>ward of them, that almost every thing in
                    their<br/> power has been done, to induce their southern<br/> neighbours to
                    relinquish the infamous, and de-<br/>basing system of personal slavery; and
                    there can<br/> be scarcely a doubt, if they persevere in their<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_225" n="225"></pb> honourable endeavours, that they will, in the end,<br/> be crowned
                    with success. </p>
<p>In conversation this evening with <a href="/people/sbrya1">Samuel
                    Bryant<persname key="sbrya1"></persname></a>,<br/> a son of the Judge of that name, he mentioned<br/> that
                        <a href="/people/bfran1">Doctor Franklin<persname key="bfran1"></persname></a> was an intimate friend of
                    his<br/> father and that in consequence there was a fre-<br/>quent intercourse
                    between the two families.<br/> Amongst a number of anecdotes relating to
                    the<br/> Doctor, he recited one, respecting his religious<br/> opinions, which
                    appeared to me worth preserving:<br/> It is as follows:--At the time the Doctor
                    lay<br/> near on his death-bed, he was visited by a young man<br/> who had a
                    great respect for his judgment in all<br/> things; and having entertained doubts
                    in his own<br/> mind, as to the truth or the scriptures, he thought<br/> that
                    this awful period, afforded a suitable oppor-<br/>tunity of consulting the
                    Doctor on this important<br/> subject. Accordingly he introduced it in a
                    solemn<br/> weighty manner, inquiring of the Doctor what<br/> were his
                    sentiments as to the truth of the scrip-<br/>tures. On the question being put,
                    although he was<br/> in a very weak state and near his close, he replied,<br/>
<said who="bfrank1">Young man! my advice to you is, that you culti-<br/> vate an
                        acquaintance with, and a firm belief in the<br/> Holy Scriptures; this is
                        your certain interest.</said>

<p>I spent this evening at<br/>
<a href="/people/ojone1">O. J.<persname key="ojone1"></persname></a>'s country house, in the vicinity of
                        <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>.<br/> It is a large handsome

<geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname> for many miles below <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.<br/> The farm is under the direction

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>,<br/> and spent the
                    afternoon at <a href="/places/woodsi">Woodside<placename key="woodsi"></placename></a>. This is a<br/>
                    beautiful spot, commanding a fine view of <a href="/places/phila">Phila-
                        delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> and of the country round it, although<br/> abroad 5 or 6
                    miles distant from that city. This<br/> was formerly the residence of <a href="/people/tmiff1">Governor Mifflin<persname key="tmiff1"></persname></a>.<br/> It has since been much
                    improved and beautified,<br/> at considerable expense by the present
                    proprietor<br/> G. A. Yet one of the greatest ornaments about<br/> the house, is
                    his worthy father-in-law, <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>.<br/>
                    Though far advanced in life, and grown old in his<br/> services to the Negroes
                    and Indians, whose steady<br/> advocate he has been, a long series of years, yet
                    his<br/> conversation is still as lively and interesting as that<br/> of any
                    young person. In the course of the after-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_227" n="227"></pb>noon he read over several communications he had<br/> received from
                    both Blacks and Indians; some of<br/> which were highly interesting. </p>

<p>Amongst those of my ac-<br/> quaintance in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, at whose houses I<br/> have been generously
                    entertained, was Captain H.<br/> whom I had seen at Liverpool. I mention
                    his<br/> name in this place, to introduce an account of a<br/> remarkable
                    preservation which he experienced not<br/> long ago, attended with some
                    circumstances ge-<br/> nerally known in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>:--He had been for<br/> some time commander of a
                    ship in the East India<br/> trade, and had acquitted himself so much to the<br/>
                    satisfaction of his employers, that he was engaged<br/> to go out again in that
                    trade, as commander of the<br/> Hindostan, in which very large property was
                    em-<br/> barked. The whole management of the outfit<br/> had been committed to
                    his care, and every thing<br/> being made ready for the voyage, the vessel
                    was<br/> on the point of sailing. At this period he found<br/> his mind so
                    oppressed at the prospect of the<br/> voyage, that he felt himself under the
                    necessity of<br/> requesting the owners of the ship, to liberate him<br/> from
                    his engagement of taking the command; but<br/> could assign no other reason than
                    the oppression<br/> on his mind at the prospect of the voyage before<br/> him;
                    observing, that he had no apprehension the<br/> ship would not prosecute her
                    voyage in safety.<br/> He further stated, that as far as concerned himself,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_228" n="228"></pb> he could not feel satisfied to take the command of<br/> her; but
                    considering his engagements, he was de-<br/> termined to fulfil them as far as
                    lay in his power,<br/> if it was <emph rend="italic">insisted</emph> upon. </p>
<p>The owners, at first, seemed disposed to enforce<br/> his compliance; yet, after
                    a little time of reflection,<br/> they gave up the point, there being several
                    well-<br/> qualified Captains ready to supply his place. The<br/> command of an
                    Indiaman is a situation eagerly<br/> sought after, being considered the most
                    profitable<br/> of any in the commercial line, as it affords many<br/>
                    opportunities of making larger profits than any<br/> other trade. Another
                    Captain was accordingly<br/> appointed in the place of Captain H. and the
                    Hin-<br/> dostan left Philadelphia, in appearance as fine a<br/> ship as had of
                    late sailed from that port; but she<br/> was never heard of after she left the
                    Delaware. </p>
<p>Thus was Captain H. preserved to his family<br/> and friends, by duly attending
                    to those urgent,<br/> though incomprehensible impressions upon his<br/> mind.
                    Some years afterwards he brought over<br/>
<a href="/people/mrout1">M. R.<persname key="mrout1"></persname></a> to England, on her return from her
                    last<br/> visit to America. </p>

<p>I went to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, whence<br/> I
                    transmitted some letters to my friends in Eng-<br/> land by way of New-York;
                    and, in the afternoon,<br/> in company with R. E. we rode over to J. H.'s, and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_229" n="229"></pb> supped and spent the evening at his house on the<br/> banks of the
                        <geogname key="schri">Schuylkil</geogname>; where he has a productive<br/>
                    farm, which appears to be well managed. The<br/> road up to the house was
                    planted on each side<br/> with English quicksets, which appeared to thrive<br/>
                    better than any I had seen in this country, I un-<br/>derstand that the winters
                    here are generally too<br/> sharp for thorn, so that they rarely answer as a
                    fence.<br/> However the native American thorn makes a good<br/> hedge; and, in
                    some parts of the Delaware State,<br/> I have seen it used to considerable
                    advantage. It<br/> is a much greater ornament to a plantation, than<br/> either
                    the common worm fence, or that of the posts<br/> and rails which generally
                    prevails throughout the<br/> United States. The farmers object to hedges in<br/>
                    general, alleging that they harbour birds and ver-<br/> min of different kinds,
                    which injure the crops. </p>

<p>were spent at<br/>
<a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a> and in its neighbourhood. In the
                    economy<br/> of a family in this country, I frequently observed<br/> a practice
                    well worthy of imitation, where soap is<br/> an expensive article. In many
                    families it is the<br/> custom to preserve the bones that are collected in<br/>
                    the kitchen after a meal. When a sufficient quan-<br/> tity is obtained, they
                    are put into a pan provided<br/> for the purpose, and some lie, made from
                    wood<br/> ashes, is poured upon them. The pan being placed<br/> near the fire,
                    if the lie is of sufficient strength to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_230" n="230"></pb> float an egg, it soon extracts all the fat; and dis-<br/> solves
                    the gristly parts in the course of a day or two.<br/> The bones are then taken
                    out, and the liquor is<br/> left near the fire, and kept to a gentle boiling
                    heat,<br/> or near it, another day or two; or until the liquor<br/> has attained
                    a ropy consistency. It will then<br/> answer all the purposes of soap; and, if a
                    proper<br/> quantity of common salt be added, it hardens and<br/> becomes real
                    soap. Many families in America<br/> never use any other kind. </p>

<dateline><date when="1806-04-21">4th Month, 21st</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I came to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and<br/> attended the
                    first sitting of the <a href="/organizations/pym">yearly meeting<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>,<br/> which
                    began at ten o'clock this morning. The<br/> number of friends attending was
                    great; but it<br/> would be difficult to form a correct estimate of the<br/>
                    whole; yet I suppose there were not less than two<br/> thousand men friends
                    present. One of the door-<br/> keepers at Arch-street meeting-house, where
                    the<br/> women friends assembled to transact their busi-<br/>ness, had the
                    curiosity to count them as they came<br/> out; and found that upwards of
                    nineteen hundred<br/> females had been assembled there. After open-<br/>ing the
                    meeting, friends proceeded to answer the<br/> queries, and went through seven of
                    them. It<br/> was pleasant to observe that a large proportion of<br/> those who
                    attended were young persons; to whom<br/> many instructive observations were
                    made. After<br/> an agreeable sitting of about two hours, the meet-<br/> ing
                    adjourned until the afternoon. Between meet-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_231" n="231"></pb>ings I dined and spent on hour two very plea-<br/> santly at
                        <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliot<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>'s, where I had the
                    company<br/> of many friends from different parts of the Con-<br/> tinent of
                    America. </p>
<p>In the afternoon I attended the second sitting<br/> of the yearly meeting; when
                    the answers to the<br/> remaining queries were read; and several reports<br/>
                    respecting the establishment of schools, and the<br/> instruction of the native
                    Indians, where brought in<br/> and taken into consideration. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1806-04-22">4th Month, 22th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>At nine o'clock I attended<br/> the third sitting of the yearly meeting. After
                    ap-<br/>pointing a committee to hear and judge of an<br/> appeal, the general
                    epistle from the yearly meeting<br/> in London was read; and six thousand copies
                    of<br/> it were ordered to be printed and distributed<br/> through the inferior
                    meetings. Epistles from the<br/> different yearly meetings on this continent
                    were<br/> also read. </p>
<p>After meeting I dined at <a href="/people/dbaco1">David Bacon<persname key="dbaco1"></persname></a>'s, in<br/>
                    company with H. J. a friend who had devoted<br/> some years to the instruction
                    of the Indians, in the<br/> useful arts of civilized life, during which time
                    he<br/> dwelt amongst them on the banks of the <geogname key="alleg">Allegany<br/> River</geogname>. From the conversation I had with this<br/>
                    friend, as well as with others who had given up<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_232" n="232"></pb> much of their time to the same purpose, it will<br/> probably be a
                    work of time, requiring a long<br/> exercise of patience and perseverance,
                    before the<br/> Indians can be brought into a state of complete<br/>
                    civilization. It has often appeared to me that<br/> there is a natural wildness
                    and quickness in them,<br/> which all the pains or labour of the
                    well-disposed<br/> white inhabitants, will find it difficult to subdue.<br/>
                    However, there are different degrees of stability<br/> and prudential care
                    amongst these people, in their<br/> natural state; many amongst them paying
                    some<br/> attention to agricultural pursuits, and, in summer,<br/> providing for
                    the wants of winter; whilst others<br/> disclaim all thought or care for the
                    future; and<br/> hold in contempt all their neighbours, who depend<br/> on any
                    other means for support than hunting.<br/> Although friends reside amongst them,
                    they are<br/> still, at certain times, in the practice of sacrificing<br/> to
                    idols of their own carving, some of which were<br/> in the form of an Indian
                    warrior of a gigantic<br/> stature; to whom they sacrificed dogs, &amp;c.<br/>
                    Notwithstanding this, they hold a tradition that<br/> the universe was created,
                    and is supported, by an<br/> all-powerful being, whom they call the Great<br/>
                    Spirit; whose influence is felt in every human<br/> breast, approving for good,
                    and reproving for evil. </p>

<p>At three o'clock in the after-<br/> noon of this may we met again, when the
                    minutes<br/> of the meeting for sufferings were read, the consi-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_233" n="233"></pb>deration of which occupied the remaining part of<br/> this fourth

<p>We met again this morning<br/> at nine o'clock, it being the fifth sitting;
                    when<br/> the state of the society, as set forth in the<br/> answers to the
                    queries, was taken into considera-<br/> tion, and much advice was given on the
                    subject of<br/> the deficiencies that appeared. </p>
<p>We met again at three o'clock, it being the<br/> sixth sitting; when the report
                    of the state of<br/> West-Town school was read, and several subjects<br/>
                    relating to that institution were considered. </p>

<p>This forenoon, meetings for<br/> worship were held at the three different
                    meeting-<br/> houses in the city. In the afternoon, at three<br/> o'clock, the
                    yearly meeting resumed its business,<br/> this being the seventh sitting. The
                    Committee of<br/> Appeals brought in their report in the case of<br/> H. J. who
                    had appealed to the yearly meeting<br/> against the decision of her monthly and
                    quarterly<br/> meetings. In the opening of business, when<br/> the appellant was
                    introduced by the men's<br/> yearly meeting, and inquired of by the clerk,
                    if<br/> she continued in the mind to prosecute her ap-<br/> peal, she, in a
                    becoming manner, replied that she<br/> came there for that purpose. After a fair and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_234" n="234"></pb> candid hearing by the committee of the yearly<br/> meeting,
                    appointed from the most impartial part<br/> of it, this poor woman, who had
                    stood as it were<br/> single and alone, was restored to her right of<br/>
                    membership in the society. </p>
<p>I believe that meetings for discipline sometimes<br/> lose their proper weight
                    and authority, by active<br/> members getting into a cold, unfeeling manner
                    of<br/> treating those who may have been brought under<br/> dealing. The habit
                    of constantly speaking to<br/> cases which occur, endangers our getting into
                    a<br/> customary form; and the mind, by this means,<br/> runs considerable risk
                    of becoming less sensible<br/> of the tendering impressions of divine
                    influ-<br/> ence. It is well frequently to remember this great<br/> truth, that
                    the more closely we attend to this sea-<br/> soning virtue, the more will our
                    minds be clothed<br/> with meekness and charity, and we shall thereby<br/> be
                    preserved from doing or saying any thing that<br/> may have a tendency to
                    irritate or wound, even<br/> by the smallest delinquent. </p>
<p>The business of the appeal being disposed of,<br/> the propriety of continuing
                    the second day morn-<br/> ing meeting was entered into; on which it was<br/>
                    agreed, that the meeting should be discontinued,<br/> and a minute to that
                    purpose was accordingly made.<br/> A report from the <a href="/organizations/pymind">Committee on Indian Affairs<orgname key="pymind"></orgname></a> was<br/> brought in and read, with a
                    statement of the re-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_235" n="235"></pb>ceipts and expenditure of the committee, by which<br/> it appeared
                    that there remained a balance in the<br/> hands of the treasurer, of about
                    2000l. currency; a<br/> part of which sum was ordered to be handed to the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> tribe of Indians, whose forefathers
                    had<br/> shown great kindness to Friends, on their first<br/> landing in this
                    country; the recollection of which<br/> had great weight on Friends' minds at
                    this time, in<br/> the distribution of this money. Thus the good<br/> deeds of
                    the forefathers of this tribe of Indians,<br/> were visited upon their
                    children's children, some<br/> of whom stood in great need of the assistance
                    now<br/> afforded, and to whom it would be very useful in<br/> providing
                    husbandry utensils, &amp;c. &amp;c.; I observed<br/> that friends were generally
                    careful not to hand<br/> their presents in money; but preferred sending<br/>
                    them various kinds of tools both for husbandry<br/> and carpenters' work; and
                    they would also, on<br/> some occasions, hire a workman to put them in a<br/>
                    way of using their tools. </p>
<p>After the close of this sitting, a friend informed<br/> me that he had a prospect
                    of removing to the<br/> Ohio, and shewed me two certificates of lands he<br/>
                    had purchased in that State, said to be of excel-<br/> lent quality, for which
                    he engaged to give 11s. 3d.<br/> per acre, to be paid by instalments; at two,
                    three,<br/> and four years. The number of friends who have<br/> emigrated into
                    that State, in the course of the last<br/> few years, is said to exceed 800
                    families; and their<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_236" n="236"></pb> increase still continued to be so great, that the<br/>
                    establishment of a new yearly meeting in those<br/> parts, began to be seriously
                    thought of. </p>

<p>I attended the eighth sitting<br/> of the yearly meeting, which began at ten
                    o'clock<br/> this morning, and the whole of it was employed<br/> the
                    consideration of the report brought in by<br/> the committee appointed to revise
                    the discipline. </p>
<p>In the afternoon we met again, at three o'clock,<br/> being the ninth sitting,
                    and proceeded in the con-<br/> sideration of the report of the committee on
                    the<br/> revision of the discipline. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1806-04-26">4th Month, 26th</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>We met again at nine o'clock,<br/> being the tenth sitting. Friends were
                    occupied<br/> during the whole time on the revision of the dis-<br/> cipline,
                    but chiefly on the subject of using and<br/> dealing in spiritous liquors, and
                    of friends keeping<br/> inns. Much was said to discourage the practice,<br/> on
                    account of the exposed situation of the families<br/> of those engaged in this
                    line of business. On the<br/> other hand, it appeared to some, that were
                    all<br/> inns in the hands of steady, consistent friends, it<br/> would be a
                    great blessing to any country, and<br/> would have a tendency considerably to
                    check that<br/> torrent of profligacy and dissipation, which too<br/> generally
                    prevails in inns and taverns. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_237" n="237"></pb>
<p>We met again at three o'clock in the afternoon,<br/> it being the eleventh
                    sitting; when the meeting<br/> proceeded in its deliberations on the revision
                    of<br/> the discipline. </p>

<p>The first day of the week I<br/> attended the North Meeting in the forenoon;
                    and<br/> in the afternoon, that held in Market-street. At<br/> the latter,
                        <a href="/people/rmott1">R. M.<persname key="rmott1"></persname></a> a friend from the neighbour-<br/>
                    hood of New-York, in the course of his testimony,<br/> explained the difference
                    between the terms wis-<br/> dom and knowledge; the former embracing not<br/>
                    only the knowledge of what is right, but also the<br/> practice of it; for this
                    only, he said, was true<br/> wisdom. On the other hand, how many, alas!<br/> are
                    possessed of the knowledge of what is right<br/> and good, but fall short in
                    firmness and integrity<br/> to uphold and practice it. This, he said, was<br/>
                    knowledge, but not wisdom. </p>

<p>This morning, at nine o'clock,<br/> I attended the twelfth sitting of the
                        <a href="/organizations/pym">yearly meet- ing<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>; the fore part of which
                    was occupied in the<br/> further discussion of the report of the committee<br/>
                    on the revision of the discipline; and some altera-<br/> tions were finally
                    agreed upon, and others were<br/> left for further consideration next year. </p>
<p>The meeting then proceeded to the reading<br/> and consideration of several
                    epistles addressed to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_238" n="238"></pb> different yearly meetings on this continent; and also<br/> of one
                    to the <a href="/organizations/lym">yearly meeting in London<orgname key="lym"></orgname></a>; which, with<br/>
                    some small alterations, were approved and adopted.<br/> After a solemn pause,
                    and a prayer to the Divine<br/> Being, the meeting concluded its twelfth
                    sitting,<br/> and the last for this year. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion week-day meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>, and
                    spent the afternoon pleasantly in<br/> company with R. J. and H. B. whom I
                    assisted<br/> in planting several paper-mulberry trees, on the<br/> vacant
                    ground near the meeting-house, which were<br/> intended to be a shade for
                    friends' horses in<br/> the summer season. There is generally a plot of<br/>
                    ground round the country meeting-houses in<br/> America, sometimes of several
                    acres, planted with<br/> shady trees, under which the horses and carriages<br/>
                    of friends stand, during meeting time, and which<br/> forms a most interesting
                    piece of scenery. </p>

<p>At <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a> I this day received<br/> letters
                    from my wife and children dated the 14th<br/> of 2d Month, giving accounts of
                    their welfare.<br/> Persons who have never removed from their<br/> native
                    country, can hardly conceive the pleasure<br/> that is derived from the
                    correspondence of near<br/> connexions when separated from them in a
                    distant<br/> land. </p>

                    and afterwards had the company of<br/> R. S. and A. K. of Philadelphia to
                    dinner. These<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_239" n="239"></pb> two young men were both of them descendants of<br/> German parents
                    who had left their native country,<br/> in order to enjoy the blessings of
                    religious liberty<br/> in this land; a privilege which neither the Em-<br/>
                    peror, nor the petty Princes of Germany, had<br/> the good sense or the policy
                    to allow. </p>

<p>This day was remarkably<br/> tempestuous; and in the evening there was so<br/>
                    great a light over the cities of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> and<br/>
<a href="/places/wches">West Chester<placename key="wches"></placename></a>, that they appeared to be on
                    fire;<br/> and next morning we received accounts, that in<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> 30 houses had been burnt
                    down<br/> in a central part of the city, and that in <a href="/places/wches">West Chester<placename key="wches"></placename></a> two large ships were burnt. Within about<br/>
                    two miles of my lodgings the same evening, a<br/> powder mill was blown up, and
                    one person who<br/> had the management of it, lost his life by the ex-<br/>
                    plosion. Not many days before the accident,<br/> being well acquainted with the
                    man, I had some<br/> conversation with him on the danger of his oc-<br/>
                    cupation; but the great wages he received out-<br/> weighed all apprehensions of
                    his danger, and he<br/> seemed to have made up his mind to continue the<br/>
                    employment, notwithstanding he had before been<br/> blown up, and narrowly
                    escaped destruction, with<br/> the loss of one eye, and the use of several of
                    his<br/> fingers. So many dreadful accidents happening<br/> around us at the
                    time called forth serious<br/> and awful reflections. </p>

<p>Being invited by one of the<br/> proprietors, I accompanied him to the ruins of
                    the<br/> powder mill which was yesterday destroyed; when<br/> I saw the remains
                    of the poor man, who had lost<br/> his life by the explosion. His whole
                    appearance<br/> was too shocking to be described. The afflicted<br/> widow, who
                    was a young woman, and several<br/> small children, stood weeping round him.

<p>This afternoon I spent at<br/> R. J.'s. Whilst here, a drove of cows passed by
                    on<br/> their way to Philadelphia market; one of them a<br/> handsome looking
                    heifer, with a fine calf by her<br/> side, attracting R. J.'s attention, he
                    bought them<br/> both for 3l. 12s. </p>

<p>I had the company of R. J.<br/> to tea this afternoon, who presented me with
                    an<br/> account of a most extraordinary persecution that<br/> was carried on in
                    the year 1763, against the last re-<br/> maining part of a particular tribe of
                    Inndians.<br/> This tribe, from their residing at Conestoga, were<br/> called
                    the <a href="/organizations/conestoga">Conestoga Indians<orgname key="conestoga"></orgname></a>. On the first
                    arrival<br/> of the English in Pennsylvania, they sent messengers<br/> to
                    welcome them, with presents of venison, corn,<br/> and skins; and entered into a
                    treaty of friendship<br/> with William Penn. This treaty had been since<br/>
                    frequently confirmed, and had never been violated,<br/> either on the part of
                    the Indians or the English,<br/> until the time that these cruel transactions took<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_241" n="241"></pb> place. It has always been observed that Indians,<br/> settled in
                    the neighborhood of white people, con-<br/> tinually diminish; and this tribe
                    had dwindled<br/> away till there remained in the village no more<br/> than
                    seven men, five women, and eight children.<br/> Of these, Shebeas, who was a
                    very old man, had<br/> assisted at the treaty with William Penn in the<br/> year
                    1701, had ever since continued a faithful<br/> friend of the English, and bore
                    the character of<br/> an exceedingly good man; for, considering his<br/>
                    extraction, he was naturally of a most kind and<br/> benevolent temper. This
                    little remnant of Indians<br/> were in the constant practice of addressing
                    every<br/> new Governor of the Province, and they ac-<br/> cordingly presented
                    an address to <a href="/people/jpenn2">John Penn<persname key="jpenn2"></persname></a>, a<br/> new Governor,
                    on his arrival; assuring him of their<br/> fidelity, and praying for a
                    continuance of that<br/> favour and protection they had hitherto experienced. </p>
<p>This address was scarcely presented, when the<br/> horrible catastrophe occurred,
                    which I am about to<br/> relate. In the townships of Paxton and Done-<br/> gal,
                    in the county of Lancaster, a number of peo-<br/> ple, actuated by the wildest
                    religious enthusiasm,<br/> in which they were encouraged by some furious<br/>
                    zealots amongst their preachers, conceived the<br/> notion that they ought to
                    extirpate the heathen<br/> from the earth, as Joshua did some nations of
                    old;<br/> that they themselves, as Saints, might possess the<br/> land. Fired
                    with this dreadful kind of zeal, on<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_242" n="242"></pb> the 14th of the 12th Month, 1763, 57 men well<br/> mounted, and
                    armed with firelocks, hatchets, and<br/> hangers, came down from the two
                    before-mentioned<br/> townships, and, surrounding the little Indian vil-<br/>
                    lage at dawn of day, broke in upon the inhabitants<br/> all at once, and fired
                    upon, stabbed, and hewed in<br/> pieces the poor defenceless creatures who
                    hap-<br/> pened to be in their huts; among them the good<br/> old Shebeas was
                    hewed in pieces in his bed. The<br/> daughter of the venerable Shebeas, who for
                    several<br/> years past had devoted her time to waiting upon<br/> her beloved
                    father, was also slain. After taking<br/> off the scalps of those who were thus
                    murdered, and<br/> setting fire to the village, the murderers mounted<br/> their
                    horses and rode away; disappointed in not<br/> having found all the Indians at
                    home, 14 out of the<br/> 20 being absent. It is not, perhaps, in the power
                    of<br/> language to express the feelings of the remaining<br/> 14 Indians, some
                    of whom were little children, on<br/> their return to the village, when they
                    beheld the<br/> mangled remains of their near and dear connexions,<br/> and saw
                    their habitations a heap of smoking ruins. </p>
<p>The Magistrates of Lancaster, hearing of what<br/> had past, came over and took
                    the survivors under<br/> their protection, doing all in their power to con-<br/>
                    sole them; and, taking them by the hand, led them<br/> to Lancaster; where, for
                    their greater security,<br/> they lodged them in a strong stone building in
                    the<br/> town, in which they were supposed to be in per-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_243" n="243"></pb>fect safety. The Governor, <a href="/people/jpenn2">John
                        Penn<persname key="jpenn2"></persname></a>, imme-<br/>diately issued a proclamation, enjoining all
                    officers<br/> both civil and Military, to assist in bringing to<br/> justice the
                    perpetrators of this horrid outrage. </p>
<p>The remaining 14 Indians continued in the house<br/> provided for them in
                    Lancaster, in the centre of<br/> the town, unconscious of danger, till the 27th
                    of<br/> the 12th Month, being 13 days from the time their<br/> village had been
                    destroyed. On that day a com-<br/> pany of men, 50 in number, well mounted
                    and<br/> armed, rode hastily into Lancaster, made the best<br/> of their way to
                    the house where the poor Indians<br/> were lodged; with violence broke open the
                    door;<br/> and with fury in their countenances rushed in upon<br/> these unarmed
                    and defenceless creatures. The In-<br/>dians seeing no protection nigh, nor and
                    possibility<br/> of escape, immediately divided into their little<br/> families;
                    the affrighted children clinging to their<br/> distressed parents. In
                    unutterable anguish they<br/> fell upon their knees, protesting their love to
                    the<br/> English people, and that in their whole lives, they<br/> had never done
                    them any injury. While thus im-<br/> ploring mercy of these hard-hearted men,
                    they<br/> were without distinction, hewn down with hatchets,<br/> and, in a few
                    moments, were laid lifeless on the<br/> floor; a deplorable instance amongst
                    many others,<br/> of what a pitch of wickedness the mind of man<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_244" n="244"></pb> may be brought to, where acting under wrong im-<br/>pressions of
                    imagined religious zeal. This cruel<br/> massacre was completed in one of the
                    largest in-<br/> lands towns in America, in the broad face of day,<br/> and in
                    so public a manner, that after the commission<br/> of this atrocious murder, the
                    miscreants all came<br/> out and stood at the door of the house, besmeared<br/>
                    with blood, gave three loud huzzas, mounted their<br/> horses, and rode away.
                    Notwithstanding this pub-<br/>licity, and a proclamation by <a href="/people/jpenn2">John Penn<persname key="jpenn2"></persname></a>, the Go-<br/> vernor, offering a reward of
                    200l. for the discovery<br/> of any of them, yet such was the dread in
                    which<br/> they were held, that none of them were brought<br/> to justice. </p>

<p>I attended the <a href="/organizations/meetvall2">Valley meeting<orgname key="meetvall2"></orgname></a> at which I
                    noticed some of the <a href="/organizations/dunkers">Dunkers<orgname key="dunkers"></orgname></a>.<br/> They are a
                    religious society who make a point of<br/> never taking off the beard. I
                    observed a comely<br/> looking young man, whose beard had so luxuriant<br/> a
                    growth, that it spread a considerable way over<br/> his breast, and gave him a
                    very patriarchal ap-<br/> pearance. At the close of the meeting several<br/>
                    friends invited me to their houses, but being pre-<br/>viously engaged, I
                    accompanied M. R. and dined<br/> with him. After dinner he shewed me his
                    barn,<br/> stables, &amp;c. which are the most complete I have<br/> seen either
                    in England or America. The barn is<br/> of stone and stands on descending
                    ground, having<br/> a south aspect. It is about 40 yards in length by<br/> 10 in
                    breadth, and 9 yards high in front. Along<br/> the north side of the barn is a
                    range of vaults<br/> which communicate with it, and are on the same<br/> level
                    with the barn. The centre vault, which com-<br/>municates with the cow-house, is
                    fitted up as a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_246" n="246"></pb> dairy; and the other vaults are made use of to<br/> preserve
                    roots, &amp;c. for the cattle, such as beets,<br/> carrots, turnips, potatoes,
                    pumpkins, &amp;c. As the<br/> carriage-road into the barn runs over the
                    vaults,<br/> as high as the topmost floor of the barn, the vaults<br/> are
                    preserved cool in the summer, and free from<br/> the frost in winter. The whole
                    of the ground<br/> floor of the barn being set apart for stables and<br/>
                    cow-houses as is commonly the case with barns<br/> in Pennsylvania, there is
                    accommodation for a<br/> great number of horses and cows. Along the<br/> front
                    of the barn, about 8 feet from the ground, a<br/> wooden stage projects about
                    six feet from the<br/> wall, inclosed overhead six or seven feet high, and<br/>
                    also at the ends and side, forming a gallery the<br/> length of the building;
                    having several communi-<br/>cations or doorways out of the barn into it. In<br/>
                    the floor of this gallery are several trap doors,<br/> through which they throw
                    fodder for the cattle into<br/> the yard during the winter months. It is
                    obvious<br/> that an appendage of this sort must be very useful<br/> in a
                    farm-yard, as it also affords a comfortable<br/> shelter to the cattle from rain
                    and snow. </p>
<p>In the afternoon M. R. accompanied me to my<br/> cousin W. B.'s, and, in our way,
                    we passed over<br/> the ground occupied by the American Army under<br/>
<a href="/people/gwash1">General Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, as an entrenched
                    camp,<br/> during the war. The remains of the entrench-<br/>ments are still
                    visible, although the scite is again<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_247" n="247"></pb> become a thick wood; so rapid is vegetation in<br/> this part of
                    the world. </p>
<p>After fording the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname>, which is here
                    broad<br/> and shallow, having several islands in it covered<br/> with lofty
                    trees, we came upon W. B.'s plantation,<br/> and soon afterwards reached his
                    habitation. We<br/> found the family sitting in the shade of the piazza,<br/> in
                    the front of the house, where we joined them<br/> in taking tea, and enjoyed the
                    freshness of the<br/> breeze, and a beautiful prospect of a great part<br/> of
                    the country between his house and Philadelphia,<br/> a distance of about 20
                    miles; and in the plea-<br/>santest part of Pennsylvania. The privilege of<br/>
                    sitting under the shade of these piazzas, enjoying<br/> the fresh air in the
                    afternoons and evenings, fully<br/> compensates for any inconvenience that is
                    suffered<br/> from the heat, in the warmest part of the day.<br/> These piazzas
                    are commonly six feet wide with<br/> boarded floors. On seeing families seated
                    in them<br/> in their tranquil summer evenings, it constantly<br/> reminded me
                    of the patriarchs of old, sitting at the<br/> doors of their tents in the cool
                    of the day. </p>

<p>was pleasantly spent at the house<br/> of a relation; and it was gratifying to
                    find that he<br/> was paying considerable attention to his flock of<br/> sheep,
                    also that his labours were in a fair way of be-<br/> ing crowned with success.
                    Hitherto the farmers in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_248" n="248"></pb> this part of the world, have paid but little attention<br/> to
                    their sheep, suffering the butchers to select<br/> the best formed for the
                    market, leaving the most<br/> ordinary for stock. The natural consequence
                    of<br/> such a plan was that the breed continually dege-<br/> nerated. Against
                    this mode of proceeding my<br/> relation had the good sense to remonstrate, and
                    to<br/> reserve for stock the best part of his flock. The<br/> beneficial
                    effects of this plan are so manifest, that<br/> I have no doubt the neighbouring
                    farmers will be<br/> induced to follow his example. I think I have<br/> before
                    noticed how fond the cattle are of salt in<br/> these parts. At the front of the
                    house is a beau-<br/> tiful lawn of many acres, gently descending to-<br/> wards
                    the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname>, in which nearly 100 sheep<br/>
                    were feeding; and so partial were they to salt,<br/> that I have seen the girls
                    go amongst them with a<br/> handful of it, and by scattering a little
                    amongst<br/> them, entice the whole flock up to the house. </p>

<p>In coming down to <a href="/places/phila">Phila- delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, I
                    noticed that the turnpike-road crosses<br/> a fine vein of marble, which, at a
                    little distance, is<br/> worked to a great advantage. </p>

<p>I attended a meeting at<br/> Merion, of which public notice had been given,<br/>
                    on account of <a href="/people/jsimp2">James Simpson<persname key="jsimp2"></persname></a>, a Minister,
                    who<br/> intended being there. In consequence the house<br/> was well filled,
                    chiefly by persons of other persua-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_249" n="249"></pb>sions; amongst them, were one Senator, four<br/> Judges, and four
                    Magistrates, who all behaved in<br/> a becoming manner. This friend is far
                    advanced<br/> in years, and much esteemed by friends in Phila-<br/>delphia and
                    the neighbourhood; yet he follows<br/> the occupation of a broom-maker, and
                    frequently<br/> comes down to that city in a handsome little car-<br/>riage,
                    loaded with his manufactory. Although<br/> a broom-maker may be accounted a mean
                    occu-<br/> pation with some men, yet few pastors stand higher<br/> in the
                    estimation of their flock than he does. </p>

<p>This day was remarkable for<br/> an almost total eclipse of the sun. About
                    eleven<br/> o'clock in the forenoon, I passed along the road<br/> from my
                    lodgings to H. B.'s, when all seemed as<br/> quiet as at midnight; some stars
                    appearing, and<br/> the birds being gone to roost. Although not so<br/> dark as
                    it commonly is in the night, yet there was<br/> something awful in the stillness
                    and appearance of<br/> the scene, there being scarcely a breath of air<br/>
                    stirring. The portion of the sun that was visible,<br/> was only about a 24th
                    part, and it cast a faint<br/> glimmering light through the leaves of the
                    trees,<br/> the shadows of which appeared like shell-work<br/> upon the
                    ground.</p>

<p>The weather now becoming<br/> warm, I had noticed several little boys and
                    girls<br/> come to the meeting at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>,
                    without shoes and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_250" n="250"></pb> stockings, though in other respects well dressed;<br/> a number of
                    men friends also, in the upper seats,<br/> sat without coats and stockings,
                    having long cot-<br/>ton trowsers which came down to their shoe tops.<br/> One
                    young man who sometimes appears in the<br/> ministry acceptably, had on a
                    striped, cotton jacket<br/> and trowsers, and a drab hat. Although these<br/>
                    appearances in dress are not familiar to an English-<br/>man, yet habit soon
                    reconciles us to them. And a<br/> person who has not experienced it, can hardly
                    con-<br/> ceive how pleasant a light dress is in these warm<br/> climates, as,
                    at every motion, the limbs are so free<br/> from obstructions. After a long warm
                    summer,<br/> when the cold weather first comes on, the incum-<br/>brance of
                    heavy clothing is much greater than<br/> might be expected.</p>

<p>This evening I was in com-<br/> pany with <a href="/people/jsimp2">James
                        Simpson<persname key="jsimp2"></persname></a>, he still continuing his<br/> religious visits in this
                    neighbourhood. I have al-<br/> ready mentioned this friend with respect, but
                    to<br/> describe him completely would be a difficult task;<br/> as it may be
                    truly said that in person and dress, as<br/> well as in the manner and subject
                    of his ministry,<br/> he is truly an original<note rend="asterisk" resp="transcr">He is since deceased.</note>. In his external appear-<br/>
                    ance, he is thin and upwards of six feet high, his<br/> visage is very long, and
                    his face of an Indian com-<br/>plexion, with small, quick eyes
                    corresponding,<br/> and, to appearance, he may be about 80 years<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_251" n="251"></pb> of age. In the gallery he commonly wears a dark<br/> coloured
                    cotton cap, fitting closely to his head,<br/> and over his shoulders a long dark
                    coloured cloak.<br/> Notwithstanding his singular appearance, he is not<br/>
                    less remarkable in his manner when exercised in<br/> the gallery. He uses
                    considerable action and<br/> gesticulation, and his sentiments, in general,
                    are<br/> almost a continual exposition of the Mosaic<br/> Law, with references
                    to the counterpart in the<br/> Gospel dispensation, which he explains in a
                    way<br/> that I never heard equalled; and with a volubility<br/> of expression,
                    and quickness of recollection, that<br/> are astonishing to a stranger. </p>

<p>I this morning paid a visit<br/> to J. J. and his wife, at their habitation.
                    This<br/> family, with many others I have met with, contra-<br/> dict a notion
                    which prevails in England, <q>That<br/> the Americans are generally short
                        lived.</q> The<br/> husband is in his 95th year, and his wife in her<br/>
                    89th year. One of his sisters is of the same age,<br/> and another sister is in
                    her 85th year; and all of<br/> them may, from every appearance, live some
                    years<br/> longer. J. J. told me, that he had often heard his<br/> father speak
                    of his having seen the foundation laid<br/> of the first house that was built in
                    Philadelphia;<br/> and I understood that he was one of <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a>'s most intimate friends. </p>
<p>I spent this evening at B. J.'s country residence.<br/> This house, which is
                    substantial and well built,<br/>

                    ground just above the Falls of the <geogname key="schri">Schuyl-<br/>
                        kill</geogname>, commanding a fine prospect of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a><br/> and the river <a href="/places/delaw">Delaware<placename key="delaw"></placename></a>, both above and below<br/> that city, being only about
                    four miles distant.<br/> The prospect embraces many beautiful country<br/>
                    residences on every hand. B. J. had lately made<br/> a purchase of the house and
                    35 acres of land<br/> adjoining. In this purchase was also included a<br/> good
                    farm-house, with an orchard, garden, out-<br/> houses, and a cottage or two. In
                    one of these<br/> cottages, close by the Falls, a family resides, who<br/> are
                    employed by B. J. in the book-binding busi-<br/> ness. The situation is as
                    pleasant as can well be<br/> conceived. </p>
<p>At this part of the river, the Shad Fishery<br/> is prosecuted with great spirit
                    in the early<br/> part of summer. Almost every farmer who hap-<br/> pens to have
                    a field on the banks of the river,<br/> keeps a net for this purpose; and, with
                    a little<br/> industry, may, in the course of two or three weeks,<br/> lay up a
                    supply for the whole year. The fish are<br/> salted, and are brought out,
                    through the winter, as<br/> a relish at breakfast and supper. </p>
<p>I have some times stood by in the evening watch-<br/> ing the people taking these
                    fish. The nets used are<br/> about 50 or 60 yards in length, and about 6 feet
                    in<br/> width; the lower side being weighted with lead, and<br/> upper side
                    supported with pieces of cork. One<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_253" n="253"></pb> end of the net is fixed firm to a stake on edge<br/> of the river,
                    whilst the other end is taken out in<br/> a small boat towards the other side.
                    After getting<br/> to the extent of it, the boat is rowed down the<br/> river,
                    bringing the end of the net with it, and<br/> at length it comes to land, a
                    little below the stake<br/> to which the other end of the net is fastened,<br/>
                    forming a circular inclosure, within which the fish<br/> are secured. As the net
                    approaches the bank of<br/> the river, the fishes are seen struggling in all
                    di-<br/> rections; till at last they are brought close to the<br/> above, when
                    they are quickly gathered up, and<br/> thrown into the boat. Several hundreds
                    are, at<br/> times, taken at one draught; but as the fishing is<br/> continued
                    through the night, during the season, the<br/> farmers often think themselves
                    well paid with 20<br/> or 30, as they weigh about 5 pounds each. </p>
<p>In the early part of the season, I think the shad<br/> is nearly equal to trout.
                    Although the practice<br/> of eating it at breakfast and supper, is not
                    com-<br/> mon in England, I soon found myself very par-<br/> tial to the shad at
                    breakfast, with coffee and toast,<br/> it being first nicely broiled over the
                    hot embers of<br/> a wood fire. </p>

<p>In walking this day, I ob-<br/> served the people to be generally engaged in
                    reap-<br/> ing barley, wheat, and rye. The farmers here<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_254" n="254"></pb> get in their harvest with little difficulty, in conse-<br/> quence
                    of the clear settled weather which generally<br/> prevails during their long

<p>I spent the afternoon and<br/> drank tea at H. B's. His bee-hives having
                    been<br/> considerably annoyed by bird, called the Bee-<br/> eater, he took out
                    his fowling-piece, and shot one<br/> of them; and on opening the craw, we
                    found<br/> many bees which it had devoured. So destructive<br/> are these birds,
                    that a nest of them would destroy<br/> several hives in the course of a summer,
                    if left<br/> undisturbed. </p>

<p>I attended the <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Preparative Meeting at
                        Merion<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>, and in the evening had a<br/> pleasant walk to Dr. H's. A
                    considerable part<br/> of the road leading to his house, is lined with<br/>
                    cedar, sassafras, shumack, sweet chesnut, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br/> but what has a
                    most singular and pleasing effect<br/> is, that most of the higher trees are
                    entirely over-<br/> grown with vines, which spread over them with<br/> great
                    luxuriance; and, when the grapes are ripe,<br/> present a very inviting
                    appearance. They are of a<br/> small black kind, and very pleasant to the
                    palate,<br/> particularly in pies and tarts; in which, according<br/> to the
                    taste, they exceed almost every other kind<br/> of fruit. They are often
                    preserved in jars, for<br/> this purpose to be used in winter. Some of the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_255" n="255"></pb> best wine I ever tasted, was made from this kind<br/> of grape.

<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, where I dined with my
                    hospitable<br/> friends J. and A. W. In the evening I paid the<br/> bride's
                    visit to S. N. She was the relict of the<br/> late <a href="/people/wsave1">W.
                        S.<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and is a worthy friend. T. N. her<br/> husband, having been a
                    kind and intimate friend of<br/>
<a href="/people/wsave1">W. S<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>'s, had been appointed by him as his
                    exe-<br/> cutor. Being of open generous disposition,<br/> and possessing amply
                    the means to indulge such<br/> an inclination, after waiting a suitable time,
                    he<br/> made the widow an offer of marriage; which was<br/> in due season
                    accepted. Thus he may at once,<br/> fill the character of husband, and fulfil
                    the trust re-<br/> posed in him by his deceased friend. I have heard<br/> T. N.
                    mention, that he left England with his parents,<br/> when about four years old,
                    and that he had no<br/> recollection of any thing in that country, except<br/>
                    the skylark, which he well remembered to have<br/> heard singing in the air.
                    This friend is one amongst<br/> many I have known in this country who have<br/>
                    emigrated from England, and have been success-<br/> ful in business; but who are
                    seldom heard of in<br/> their native land. </p>

<p>After attending meeting, I<br/> accompanied R. J. to his brother J. J's where<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_256" n="256"></pb> we drank tea. Before we left his house, he gave<br/> us a taste of
                    his cyder, made from a species of<br/> apple, called the Virginia crab, the
                    produce of his<br/> own orchard. It was superior to any liquor I have<br/> ever
                    tasted of the kind; indeed I have seldom drank<br/> a glass of wine equal to it,
                    either as to body or<br/> flavour. </p>
<p>Afterwards we called upon D. J. an ancient<br/> friend, whose parents were
                    amongst the first set-<br/> tlers of this province. In the evening we
                    called<br/> upon J. Z. a friend whose progenitors came from<br/> Germany. On my
                    noticing a number of fine hogs<br/> in his orchard, which appeared very
                    attentive to<br/> the fall of the fruit, he told me that he annually<br/>
                    brought up about twenty of them, which derived a<br/> great part of their
                    support from peaches, apples,<br/> &amp;c. during the day; and, in the evenings
                    and<br/> mornings, they were supplied with milk from his<br/> dairy. As he made
                    a considerable quantity of<br/> butter for the Philadelphia market, the old
                    milk<br/> and butter milk went in aid of the fruit in the<br/> orchard, to bring
                    forward the hogs, which are<br/> fatted with Indian corn, at the close of the
                    year,<br/> to a large size. </p>

<p>In the evening we called upon<br/> H. B. who was engaged amongst his reapers
                    in<br/> the wheat field. He calculated that his produce<br/> this year would be
                    30 bushels of wheat per acre;<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_257" n="257"></pb> an increase which must pay the farmer well,<br/> where the land,
                    generally speaking, is rented at<br/> 10s. an acre per annum; there being no
                    tithes,<br/> and the taxes amounting to scarcely 1s. per acre. </p>

<p>The evening being serene and<br/> pleasant, I took a walk in company with
                    our<br/> neighbour R. B. and visited some of the neigh-<br/> bouring families.
                    Although this may be deemed<br/> the hottest season of the year, I found no
                    incon-<br/> venience from the exercise of walking, but it<br/> must be
                    remembered that our clothing was very<br/> light. In passing along we were
                    entertained with<br/> the appearance of immense quantities of fire flies,
                    in<br/> the fields and woods around us. They had the<br/> appearance of immense
                    quantities of bright sparks<br/> of fire, flying in all directions amongst the
                    grass<br/> and corn, as well as the leaves and boughs of the<br/> loftiest
                    trees. </p>

<p>Having been several times<br/> kindly invited, I dined with P. W. a
                    respectable<br/> paper-maker in the neighbourhood of <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>,<br/> where I spent the afternoon pleasantly. The<br/>
                    situation is beautifully romantic, being in a deep<br/> narrow valley, the steep
                    hills on each side of which<br/> are covered with wood. The mill which
                    would<br/> be considered as an extensive one even in England,<br/> almost wholly
                    employed in making writing and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_258" n="258"></pb> printing paper, with large quantities of which he<br/> supplies
                    the printers and stationers in Philadelphia.<br/> During the visit he gave me a
                    little history of his<br/> life. About 20 years ago, being then 12 years of<br/>
                    age, he left Mentz, his native place in Germany,<br/> accompanied by his father,
                    who died on the pas-<br/> sage to this country. Being of that class of emi-<br/>
                    grants called redemptioners already mentioned,<br/> P. W. on the arrival of the
                    ship in the Delaware,<br/> was hired by <a href="/people/hdrin1">Henry
                        Drinker<persname key="hdrin1"></persname></a>, and was employed<br/> about the house as a waiting boy,
                    and assistant to<br/> the girls in the kitchen. After spending nearly<br/> four
                    months in this family, and having acquired the<br/> English language, he had the
                    good sense to dis-<br/> cern, that it would be more to his interest to be<br/>
                    taught some manufacture; and requested liberty<br/> of his master to be put
                    apprentice to a paper-<br/> maker, which was readily granted, although his<br/>
                    first indenture was not yet expired. After having<br/> obtained a knowledge of
                    the manufacture of paper,<br/> he, by industry and care, acquired sufficient
                    pro-<br/> perty and credit to enable him to begin business;<br/> which he has
                    now, for several years, carried on to<br/> advantage. I never was in a
                    paper-mill where<br/> the business was managed with more neatness and<br/>
                    order. As I sat in the house it was pleasant to<br/> reflect on such an instance
                    of successful industry.<br/> He has a rising family of healthy looking
                    children<br/> about him, with an amiable wife and several<br/> sisters. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_259" n="259"></pb>
<p>In returning to my lodgings, I had the curiosity<br/> to take the dimensions of a
                    chesnut tree, of the<br/> sweet kind, which stood by the way side; and<br/>
                    round it more than 27 feet in circumference, and<br/> its thickness continued in
                    regular proportion to<br/> the height of about seven yards, which was the<br/>
                    length of the bole, clear of branches. </p>

<p>I have noticed for a day or<br/> two past, that the harvest for wheat, rye,
                    and<br/> barley, is entirely over, not having continued more<br/> than two
                    weeks. The serene and settled weather<br/> generally prevalent here, with the
                    practice of work<br/> people of all descriptions turning into the harvest<br/>
                    field, makes short work of it. It is not customary<br/> here, as in England, for
                    the women to work<br/> in the harvest field at all. In this neighbourhood<br/>
                    the blacksmiths, wheelwrights, weavers, taylors,<br/> &amp;c. &amp;c. all shut
                    up their shops to assist the far-<br/> mers. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a>,<br/> and in the
                    afternoon visited an ancient friend of<br/> the name of <a href="/people/mpric1">Mary Price<persname key="mpric1"></persname></a>, who, although upwards<br/> of 80 years of age,
                    generally walks about a mile to<br/> meeting; and, considering her years,
                    continues to<br/> be an active, lively woman. At her house I was<br/> shewn a
                    deed of conveyance, of five thousand acres<br/> of land, the purchase-money for
                    which was one<br/> hundred pounds, reserving a quit-rent to <a href="/people/wpenn1">William
<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> and his heirs, of 1s. per acre. The same<br/>
                    land, where inclosed, now sells for 12l. per acre,<br/> being a six hundred fold
                    advance in the course of<br/> 120 years, on the intrinsic value of the land.
                    The<br/> above-mentioned deed was a conveyance from<br/> Charles Lloyd, and a
                    female of the name of<br/> Davies, to a person of the name of Humphreys.<br/>
                    This deed is in the hands of M. P's daughter-<br/> in-law, who is a descendant

                    Lewis-Town, near the<br/> mouth of the Delaware. Although not more<br/> than 25
                    years old, his loss will be severely felt by<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_261" n="261"></pb> the black people in that neighbourhood. He had<br/> been an ardent

                    them<br/> from a state of slavery, who had been cruelly<br/> forced into
                    bondage, by a set of unprincipled<br/> men, from Georgia, who sometimes
                    hover<br/> about this part of the Delaware State and Mary-<br/> land, and carry
                    off whole families of free Negroes<br/> in the night. They take them on board

                    Georgia and the Carolinas, where<br/> they are sold to the planters. </p>
<p>I have seen several of the black people whom<br/> he had rescued and sent up to

<a href="/people/hbowm1">Henry Bowman<persname key="hbowm1"></persname></a>. The latter had procured
                    them<br/> situations in the interior of Pennsylvania, out of<br/> the reach of
                    these barbarous men. Not long ago,<br/> a mother, with seven children, was thus
                    carried<br/> off, in the dead of the night, from this neighbour-<br/> hood. This
                    flagrant act deeply excited <a href="/people/jrowl1">J. Row-
                    land<persname key="jrowl1"></persname></a>'s attention; and, after riding nearly one thou-<br/> sand miles,
                    he was enabled to rescue the whole<br/> family, and bring them safe home to
                    their native<br/> place, although they had been dispersed and sold<br/> into
                    various hands, by the kidnappers, in different<br/> parts of Georgia. </p>
<p>A very short time back, this excellent young<br/> man was taken ill of a fever,
                    which, notwith-<br/> standing every help was afforded him, made so<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_262" n="262"></pb> regular yet rapid a progress, that in a few days<br/> all hopes of
                    his recovery were at an end. Through<br/> the whole, his mind was preserved calm
                    and se-<br/> rene, and, when sensible that the closing period<br/> of time was
                    at band, he requested that his<br/> domestics might be called into the room.
                    These<br/> consisted of two white servants, two Negro<br/> boys, and a little
                    orphan girl, whose mother had<br/> been many years a nurse in the family, out
                    of<br/> respect to whom, he supported and educated the<br/> child. The mind may
                    conceive the situation<br/> and feelings of this little group, yet I am ready
                    to<br/> believe it is impossible for the pen to describe it.<br/> After a short
                    but awful pause, he addressed each<br/> of them in the language and accents of a
                    father;<br/> for indeed as a parent he had always conducted<br/> himself towards
                    them. Having communicated to<br/> them counsel and advice suited to their
                    several<br/> sizes and condition, he gently turned his face<br/> from them, and
                    quietly resigned himself, and left the<br/> world without a sigh or struggle; a
                    bright example<br/> of faithfulness to his Divine Master, and a more<br/>
                    intelligible exposition of the Gospel of Jesus<br/> Christ, than whole volumes
                    of controversy. </p>

<p>I continued at my<br/> lodgings at <a href="/people/merio">Merion<persname key="merio"></persname></a>,
                    making some arrangements<br/> for my return to England. </p>
<p>I have sometimes noticed how expert the people<br/> of America are with the saw
                    and the axe, and as<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_263" n="263"></pb> an instance of their dexterity, I may mention what<br/> a very
                    respectable millwright, whose veracity may<br/> be relied on, this day told me.
                    He said that him-<br/> self and one assistant had cut down, in one day,<br/> 35
                    forest trees, of which a considerable part were<br/> oak, and which averaged 6
                    feet in circumference.<br/> He added, that on using extraordinary exertion,<br/>
                    they cut down one tree of this bulk in 7 1/2 minutes. </p>

<p>I was em-<br/> ployed in preparations for my return home, the<br/> prospect of
                    which was more pleasing to me than<br/> I can express. In walking out into the
                    fields<br/> about this time, I noticed the crops of Indian corn<br/> in the
                    neighbourhood, which, in the line of hus-<br/> bandry, are truly grand and
                    beautiful at this season<br/> of the year, far exceeding any thing of the
                    kind<br/> to be met with in England. Many of the plants<br/> rise to the height
                    of 10 or 12 feet, terminating at<br/> the top with an elegant kind of flower
                    somewhat<br/> resembling a tuft of feathers. The leaves or blades<br/> which
                    shoot from the stalk, and branch from it<br/> all the way up, are about the
                    breadth of four<br/> inches, and from two to three feet in length. The<br/>
                    whole gives a field of Indian corn a most luxuri-<br/> ant appearance. </p>

                    in<br/> American ships trading to the West Indies. </p>

<p>In the course of this day,<br/> 0. J. and his mother-in-law called upon us.
                    This<br/> venerable female, who is now far advanced in<br/> years, has survived
                    a numerous flock of lovely<br/> daughters, I think 10 in number, who have,
                    in<br/> succession, been taken away from the troubles of<br/> time, just as the
                    affections of a mother would be<br/> likely to feel most keenly the privation. </p>
<p>I had often remarked a settled grief upon her<br/> countenance, notwithstanding
                    the affluence that<br/> was manifest in every thing around her; but had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_265" n="265"></pb> not heard the mournful story till I had it from her<br/> own

<p>I had received several kind<br/> invitations from both J. and C. S. to pay them
                    a<br/> visit at their habitations, at <a href="/places/shoe">Shoemakers
                        Town<placename key="shoe"></placename></a>,<br/> before I left this country. They are a family<br/>
                    for whom I have entertained a great esteem, ever<br/> since I have known them;
                    and the quarterly<br/> meeting at <a href="/organizations/abingqm">Abington<orgname key="abingqm"></orgname></a>
                    falling at this time, I proposed<br/> embracing both objects; and, setting out
                    after<br/> dinner, came to C. S.'s this evening. Here I was<br/> hospitably
                    entertained, and had the agreeable com-<br/> pany of several friends from
                    Philadelphia and the<br/> neighbourhood. </p>

                        quarterly meeting<orgname key="abingqm"></orgname></a>, which was<br/> very large. The meeting-house is

                    number of people. It is situated on a piece of<br/> ground containing several

<p>After breakfast we returned<br/> to J. S.'s, where we spent an hour or two
                    plea-<br/> santly, with a number of valuable friends resident<br/> in this
                    quarter. The weather was very warm,<br/> but the house was spacious, with wide passages<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_266" n="266"></pb> through it, and no want of windows; and they with<br/> the doors
                    being thrown open, it gave a free and<br/> lively circulation to the air, which
                    is very reviving<br/> in this climate. </p>
<p>After sitting a little time in the parlour, a cir-<br/> cumstance occurred which
                    I think I shall not soon<br/> forget. We entered into general conversation,<br/>
                    after which a silent pause ensued; and as I sat<br/> musing on the prospect of
                    my voyage home, with<br/> some little anxiety respecting the perils of it,
                    a<br/> friend of Philadelphia, who sometimes appears in<br/> the ministry, broke
                    the silence that prevailed, by<br/> remarking that his mind had been occupied
                    in<br/> the consideration of my voyage, and that for my<br/> encouragement he
                    might say, he had a belief that<br/> I should be favoured to arrive safe in my
                    native<br/> land, in two months from that time. No observa-<br/> tion was now
                    made on this intimation, but, on<br/> reaching my lodgings, I wrote to my wife
                    inform-<br/> ing her of the circumstance, and that I trusted the<br/> friend
                    would prove a true prophet. My letter<br/> reached her hands two or three weeks
                    previously<br/> to my landing. </p>
<p>After spending the morning as above related,<br/> most of us attended a public
                    meeting at <a href="/places/germa">German- town<placename key="germa"></placename></a>, about six or
                    seven miles distant, and being<br/> requested by T. F. I accompanied him with
                    seve-<br/> ral other friends to his country house, which he<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_267" n="267"></pb> calls Wakefield. There we dined in a room on a<br/> level with the
                    cellar, which I found very pleasant,<br/> the weather being very warm, and the
                    situation<br/> admitting plenty of light. A dining-room so situ-<br/> ated, is a
                    great privilege at this season of the year,<br/> in a climate like this. </p>
<p>After spending a pleasant hour or two here I<br/> came to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, where I found letters from<br/> my wife of as
                    late a date as towards the end of the<br/> 5th month. In riding along the
                    street, I passed<br/> by J. G's house, and his wife, a native of Lan-<br/>
                    caster, kindly inviting me to take tea, I spent a<br/> little time with them,
                    and in the evening returned<br/> to my lodgings at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>. </p>
<p>In recurring to the intimation respecting the<br/> time of my return to England,
                    there are several<br/> circumstances attending it, which I think are<br/> worthy
                    of remembrance, though they are a little<br/> out of the regular course of my
                    narrative. It has<br/> been already mentioned, that it was my inten-<br/> tion
                    to sail in the John Morgan, but that I was<br/> disappointed by the owners
                    making an alteration in<br/> the time for her departure. After this T. W.
                    and<br/> I had concluded to sail for Greenock, in the<br/> Frances, she being a
                    fine, new vessel with good<br/> accommodation; but in this design I was again
                    dis-<br/> appointed, the ship sailing before I could be quite<br/> ready. In her
                    passage she encountered a violent<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_268" n="268"></pb> storm, which nearly reduced her to a wreck; and<br/> such were the
                    difficulties the ship's company had<br/> to encounter, that several of the
                    passengers and<br/> seamen lost their lives. Notwithstanding I was fa-<br/>
                    voured to escape these imminent perils, there was<br/> considerable probability
                    of my not reaching Eng-<br/> land by the time mentioned; as I still remained
                    at<br/> New-York, when it wanted only about four weeks<br/> to the completion of
                    that period; and after we got<br/> on board, we were detained on the American
                    coast<br/> nearly two weeks, by calms and light winds. Yet<br/> we crossed the
                    Atlantic ocean from thence in the<br/> short period of 9 days. On the <date when="1806-08-10">10th</date> day, and<br/> 23d of our voyage, we made
                    soundings off Cape<br/> Clear, and on the 26th day landed safely at Liver-<br/>
                    pool, where I was affectionately received by my<br/> near relations in that
                    town, within the time which<br/> the friend had predicted I should return. I
                    for-<br/> bear making any farther comments on these cir-<br/> cumstances. But in
                    the course of events I felt<br/> in my heart the sentiments of humble
                    thankfulness<br/> to the great Preserver of Men. </p>

<p>I spent this day at J. H's<br/> in company with M.
                        E. from Elklands. She was<br/> then on a visit to her father, who
                    had been seized<br/> with a paralytic affection, which had entirely de-<br/>
                    prived him of the use of speech; yet I have seldom<br/> seen a man preserved in
                    such innocent cheerful-<br/> ness as he was. It is wonderful to observe what<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_269" n="269"></pb> a degree of happiness the mind is capable of en-<br/> joying,
                    under privations like these, when it has<br/> been preserved in a good degree of
                    innocency. </p>

<p>A friend in the neighbour-<br/> hood gave me an account of an acquaintance
                    of<br/> his, a native of Ireland, but who now resides<br/> near Lancaster, in
                    the State of Pennsylvania,<br/> which I think worth preserving. This person<br/>
                    left Ireland when he was nearly 16 years old, and<br/> his whole property when
                    he landed amounted only<br/> to about 12 guineas. He has now established<br/>
                    extensive iron works where he resides, in which<br/> he employs towards of 50
                    waggon teams; and the<br/> profits of which, last year, amounted to
                    twenty-five<br/> thousand pounds. What makes it the more re-<br/> markable is,
                    that two persons possessing a large<br/> capital had been ruined some time
                    before, in an<br/> attempt to establish the same concern. </p>

<p>In walking out this evening,<br/> I met with two German families on their way
                    to<br/> he Ohio. On entering into conversation with<br/> them, they informed me,
                    that they were yet 500<br/> miles distant from the place of their
                    destination.<br/> The were a company of fine, healthy looking<br/> people, and
                    travelled along with apparent chear-<br/> fulness. The older females and the
                    little ones were<br/> upon beds in their covered waggons, whilst the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_270" n="270"></pb> young women, with their husbands, fathers, and<br/> brothers went
                    on foot. Parties of this sort I have<br/> often seen travelling along, in the
                    old Patriar-<br/> chal style, seeking a country where they hoped to<br/> meet
                    with more tranquillity and repose, than they<br/> had witnessed in the old
                    principalities of Germany. </p>
<p>Considering the stability and industry, which so<br/> eminently characterize most
                    of the German emi-<br/> grants, I am inclined to believe that things must
                    be<br/> very much out of order, in their native land, before<br/> men like them,
                    would come to the resolution of<br/> taking a final farewell of their near
                    connexions<br/> and friends; with the perils and inconveniences of<br/> so long
                    a voyage before them. </p>

<p>I paid a visit to our neigh-<br/> bour Doctor H. After tea we called upon a
                    family<br/> of the name of Crow, where I saw a little esta-<br/>blishment just
                    as it stood in the first settlement of<br/> the country. It consisted of a small
                    workshop,<br/> containing a set of tools proper for blacksmiths<br/> and
                    carpenters, which at that period, must have<br/> been an almost invaluable
                    appendage to a farm-<br/>house. The Doctor complained to us that he had<br/>
                    lately lost nearly the whole of his ducks and geese;<br/> which had been
                    devoured by a large species of<br/> tortoise. This animal creeping on the bottom
                    of<br/> the pond, seizes the unsuspecting fowls by the<br/> feet, and dragging
                    them under water, eats them<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_271" n="271"></pb> at his leisure. The Doctor had a respectable esta-<br/>blishment
                    for the education of his children; having<br/> an exclusive library, with a pair
                    of large globes,<br/> and an amiable young woman from England as<br/> tutors,
                    who was well qualified for her office, his<br/> children being mostly girls.

<p>I went over to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>;<br/> and having
                    had several pressing invitations from<br/> Doctor G. who had been a
                    fellow-student with<br/> my brother William at Edinburgh, I dined with<br/> him.
                    The Doctor is one amongst the few of that<br/> profession, who retain their
                    integrity, by continu-<br/> ing to be consistent members of our society;
                    and<br/> he is a very useful member of the monthly meeting<br/> to which he
                    belongs. In the afternoon I spent a<br/> little time at <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>'s and <a href="/people/sfish1">Samuel
                        Fisher<persname key="sfish1"></persname></a>'s;<br/> and took my farewell of them all, with
                    sentiments<br/> of esteem, and of gratitude for the many instances<br/> of their
                    kind attentions to me. While in this city, I<br/> received letters from my wife
                    and family down to<br/> the 6th Month 16th, with satisfactory accounts of<br/>
                    their welfare. </p>

<p><a href="/people/ojone1">O. J.<persname key="ojone1"></persname></a> having kindly offered<br/> me a seat in
                    his carriage, I accompanied him to<br/> the annual general meeting in the
                        <a href="/places/valle">Valley<placename key="valle"></placename></a>; at which<br/> a great number of
                    friends and others attended;<br/> indeed, a great many more than the house,
                    though<br/> large, was able to contain. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_272" n="272"></pb>
<p>After meeting, we accepted an invitation from<br/> J. C. and dined at his house,
                    where we sat down<br/> to table with him and his wife, their aged father<br/>
                    and mother, ten daughters and one son; being a<br/> fair sample of an American
                    farmer's family. I<br/> was informed that his neighbour D. G. a respec-<br/>
                    table farmer, with whom I have often been in<br/> company, has ten sons and one
                    daughter. </p>
<p>Considering the accounts I had read, of the<br/> homely fare and accommodations
                    of the planters<br/> in America, I was struck with the number and<br/> elegance
                    of the carriages we saw on the road, in<br/> going from meeting to the house
                    where we dined;<br/> part of the way lying through the forest, and some<br/>
                    part through a country in a high state of cultiva-<br/> tion, the prospects were
                    beautifully diversified. </p>
<p>In our way home, we took tea at the pro-<br/>prietor's of an extensive marble
                    quarry, who<br/> kindly conducted us into it; where we had an op-<br/> portunity
                    of seeing the people at work, in sepa-<br/>rating large blocks from the solid
                    rock. This<br/> vein of marble, which appeared to be from 15 to<br/> 20 yards in
                    width, runs in the direction of south-<br/>east, and north-west, through a
                    stratum of lime-<br/>stone, a few feet below the surface of the ground;<br/> and
                    it has the appearance of there having been<br/> cleft in the limestone rock,
                    into which the mar-<br/>ble had been poured in a liquid state. Col. H. at<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_273" n="273"></pb> whose house we were generously entertained, and<br/> who is owner
                    of the quarry, informed us that he<br/> had sold thirteen thousand cubic feet
                    from it in<br/> one year, at 4s. 6d. per foot. The weather being<br/> fine, and
                    our little party consisting of several<br/> agreeable men and women friends, the
                    day was<br/> spent very pleasantly. </p>

<p>A. B. a friend from England,<br/> paid me a visit, having some prospect of taking
                    a<br/> farm in this neighbourhood. His predecessors<br/> for several
                    generations, had lived upon a farm on<br/> Delamere Forest in Cheshire; but the
                    steward to<br/> the present proprietor, having turned him off the<br/> farm, he,
                    with his widowed mother, and several<br/> sisters and a brother, had lately come
                    over to<br/> America, with the view of taking and managing a<br/> cheese farm,
                    upon the Cheshire plan. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1806-08-23">8th Month, 23d</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>I accompanied A. B. to<br/> G. A.'s in order to have some conversation with<br/>
                    him respecting a farm he had to let, and to view it.<br/> This farm was in a
                    good state of cultivation, with<br/> an excellent house, a very large barn, and
                    stabling<br/> for many horses, with other conveniences on an<br/> extensive
                    scale. The spring house, or dairy, in<br/> particular struck my attention,
                    having a trench of<br/> spring water, about 2 feet wide and 4 or 5 inches<br/>
                    deep, running all round the room, paved at the<br/> bottom, and inclosed at the
                    sides with slabs of<br/> white marble. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_274" n="274"></pb>
<p>I have before observed, that in the spring wa-<br/> ter which surrounds the floor
                    of the dairies in this<br/> country, are placed the vessels which contain
                    the<br/> milk, &amp;c. and all is thus preserved sweet and cool,<br/> in the
                    hottest part of the summer. Another<br/> conveniency I noticed in this
                    farm-yard, was an<br/> appendage to the hog-sty being a vault, near<br/> which
                    was a stream of water, all within the inclo-<br/> sure wherein the hogs were
                    confined. The advan-<br/> tages and comfort thus resulting to these animals,
                    in<br/> hot weather must be obvious. On this farm, was<br/> also an excellent
                    orchard of several acres, the trees<br/> of which were at this time in their
                    prime, and<br/> now in full bearing, and having been planted by<br/> the late
                        <a href="/people/tmiff1">Governor Mifflin<persname key="tmiff1"></persname></a>, whose residence was<br/>
                    here, they were well selected. Such abundance<br/> of fine fruit I never before
                    beheld, in the same<br/> compass of ground; two or three of the best trees<br/>
                    were literally broken down with the weight of the<br/> fruit. The rent G. A.
                    proposed for his farm,<br/> with all these appendages, was about 20s. per<br/>
                    acre; and, the quantity being short of 100 acres,<br/> the rent would amount to
                    little more than legal<br/> interest for the money which had been expanded<br/>
                    in buildings. As it was not more than an hour's<br/> ride from Philadelphia, and
                    the land of good qua-<br/> lity, I thought the price very reasonable. </p>

<p>I attended <a href="/organizations/meetmer">Merion meeting<orgname key="meetmer"></orgname></a><br/> in the forenoon;
                    and in the afternoon visited and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_275" n="275"></pb> drank tea with <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, in
                    company with<br/> B. J. Most of the afternoon we sat in the piazza<br/> in front
                    of the house, at <a href="/places/woodsi">Woodside<placename key="woodsi"></placename></a>, where we had<br/>
                    a fine view of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, the <a href="/places/jerse">Jerseys<placename key="jerse"></placename></a>, and the<br/> intervening country. We were
                    much entertained<br/> with the little Humming Birds, flying about the<br/>
                    flowers near our seats. </p>

<p>My business requiring that<br/> I should see a person who was at the <a href="/places/yello2">Yellow Springs<placename key="yello2"></placename></a>, I this day took a ride
                    thither. At the<br/> inn where I breakfasted, which was the General<br/> Paoli
                    Tavern, I met with a family who had landed<br/> a few days before in
                    Philadelphia, and were now<br/> on their way to the Ohio. As they spoke
                    neither<br/> English no French, I was unable to make out<br/> from what part of
                    the continent of Europe they<br/> came; but, from their dress, I supposed
                    from<br/> Switzerland. The men wore a plain jacket and<br/> trowsers, with very
                    large shallow crowned hats;<br/> and the women had their hair plaited in long
                    braids,<br/> which hung down their backs, with jackets and<br/> petticoats just
                    the reverse of the fashions of the pre-<br/> sent day. Altogether they had the
                    appearance of a<br/> stout, hardy race, and, in this company, I understand<br/>
                    there were four generations. The master of the<br/> inn informed me that he had
                    reason to believe they<br/> had a very large property with them, in the
                    wag-<br/> gons in which they travelled. On my arrival at<br/> the Yellow
                    Springs, I bathed and drank the waters,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_276" n="276"></pb> which are I believe, a chalybeate. In the evening<br/> I returned
                    to <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, where I lodged, but was<br/> kept
                    awake for a while in reflecting on the wide<br/> wasting effects of war,
                    probably in consequence of<br/> meeting with the family of strangers at the
                    Paoli<br/> Tavern. That spot was rendered famous by the de-<br/> struction, as
                    is said, of some hundred Americans,<br/> who lay encamped there, and were
                    surprized in the<br/> dead of the night by a detachment of the English<br/>
                    army, and put to the sword. The consequence of<br/> which was, I have been
                    informed, that a party of<br/> English met with the same fate in a similar way,
                    from<br/> the swords of the Americans, on the Banks of Hud-<br/> son River. In
                    addition to that event, I understood,<br/> from the master of the inn, that the
                    family of<br/> strangers I had mentioned, all of whom appeared<br/> to be
                    persons of respectability, had been compelled<br/> to seek shelter in a foreign
                    land, to avoid the<br/> scourge of the sword, which had recently over-<br/>
                    whelmed their country. </p>
<p>How little do the potentates of the world and<br/> their ministers, calculate on
                    the miseries they pro-<br/> duce. And ah! how little do they consider what<br/>
                    responsibility, in the nature of things, they must<br/> inevitably entail upon
                    themselves in a future state<br/> of being. </p>

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_277" n="277"></pb> to his family, whose kindness and hospitality I<br/> have

                    took my final farewell of them, with<br/> sentiments of gratitude for their

                    we took, in all probability, a final fare-<br/> well of each other, with many
                    expressions of af-<br/> fection on their part, which were equally felt on<br/>
                    my own; having contracted a sincere regard for<br/> the little company of

                    passage for England, being accompanied by A. B.<br/> In my way I passed through
                        <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, but<br/> being limited for
                    time, I had opportunity of calling<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_278" n="278"></pb> upon only a few friends; some of whom kindly<br/> attended me to
                    the Burlington packet, which lay<br/> at Arch-street wharf. I. and J. P. two
                    generous<br/> hearted young men, remained with me until we<br/> put off into the
                        <geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>, and spread our sails to<br/> the
                    wind, which in about one hour and a half<br/> wafted us safe to <a href="/places/burli">Burlington<placename key="burli"></placename></a>; a distance of near<br/> 20 miles. Here I
                    called upon G. and S. D. J.<br/> H. and several other friends, who felt dear
                    to<br/> me in the prospect of parting with them, perhaps<br/> never to see them
                    more in this state of being.<br/> After taking an affectionate farewell of them,
                    A. B.<br/> and myself set out in the stage for <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, and<br/> passed through <a href="/places/crosw">Croswicks<placename key="crosw"></placename></a>. Here friends have a<br/> large well-built
                    meeting-house, with a school and<br/> other conveniences on a large scale. We
                    lodged<br/> that night at Cranbury. One of our companions<br/> in the stage, was
                    a person of the name of Reckless,<br/> who informed me that he was a descendant
                    of the<br/> Sheriff of that name, formerly of Nottingham, and<br/> mentioned by
                    George Fox in his Journal. This<br/> family have increased in number and
                    consequence<br/> since coming into America, and have founded a<br/> town which

<p>We came safe to <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, and,<br/> about two
                    o'clock in the afternoon, set sail for<br/>
<a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>; yet, having but little wind, we
                    did<br/> not reach the <geogname key="narro">Narrows</geogname> till after dark.
                    The wind<br/> beginning to blow very strong, the Captain of the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_279" n="279"></pb> Packet thought it unsafe to attempt passing them;<br/> he
                    therefore put the ship about, with an intention<br/> to run into <geogname key="prinbay">Princes Bay</geogname>, and there lie at anchor<br/> till next
                    morning, being a distance of near 20<br/> miles. As we were running before the
                    wind, at<br/> the rate of 6 miles an hour, in the dead of the<br/> night, with a
                    very rough sea, the vessel sud-<br/> denly struck against something which
                    immediately<br/> stopped her progress; and she swung round with<br/> great
                    violence and noise. At the first alarm I ran<br/> upon deck, when I found that
                    our vessel had run<br/> foul of another, which was lying at anchor; and<br/> our
                    bowsprit was entangled in the rigging of the<br/> other ship. This so broke the
                    force of the shock,<br/> that we sustained but little damage, and in a
                    short<br/> time got clear of each other. We had great cause<br/> to be thankful
                    for so signal a preservation, many<br/> vessels having been lost, with the
                    people in them,<br/> when in much less apparent danger than we were<br/> on this
                    occasion. </p>

<p>Yesterday I called upon se-<br/> veral of my friends to take leave of them, and
                    this<br/> day, accompanied by J. W. and T. W. I went on<br/> board the Oliver
                    Elsworth, with a view of taking<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_280" n="280"></pb> my passage for Liverpool; and being satisfied,<br/> both with the
                    Captain and the ship, I concluded<br/> to go in her, and paid my passage
                    accordingly.<br/> In the afternoon, <a href="/people/jmurr1">J. M.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>
                    having kindly offered me<br/> a seat in his carriage: I rode with him to
                    his<br/> country house, and was generously entertained<br/> under his hospitable
                    roof. </p>

<p>This morning I went out with<br/> J. M. to attend upon a black man, who had
                    come<br/> from New-York, to treat for the purchase of a<br/> chaise which J. M.
                    wished to sell, having lately<br/> purchased a new one upon a different
                    construction.<br/> In conversation I gathered a little of the history<br/> of
                    this black man, who by his industry and ma-<br/> nagement, had acquired a
                    considerable freehold<br/> property in houses in the city and could now,<br/>
                    with propriety, indulge his family with the conve-<br/> niency of a chaise. </p>
<p>A few years past he was in very low circum-<br/> stances, but coming under the
                    notice of <persname>J. M.</persname><br/> who has been, I believe, amongst the
                    foremost in<br/> befriending the poor blacks, he was put for-<br/> ward and
                    assisted in business, and with so much<br/> success, that he is now become a
                    very respectable<br/> tradesman. Indeed he ranks much higher than many<br/> of
                    those, who have so strenuously contended that<br/> the poor blacks are little or
                    nothing removed from<br/> the brute creation; and that they may be bought,<br/>
                    sold, and degraded, as having neither the feelings<br/> nor faculties of men. So
                    erroneous is this idea,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_281" n="281"></pb> that I have met with slave merchants, who were<br/> far inferior
                    to this black person, in the faculties<br/> of the mind. </p>
<p>After a pleasant morning thus spent at J. M.'s,<br/> he brought me to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and shewed me<br/> through the cellars of
                    his extensive brewery in<br/> that city. The remaining part of the day, was<br/>
                    spent in preparations for my voyage to England. </p>

<p>This morning I attended <a href="/organizations/meetny">New- York<orgname key="meetny"></orgname></a> meeting,
                    and afterwards dined at my cousin<br/> B. B.'s; and drank tea and spent the
                    evening with<br/> some other of my friends. </p>
<p>The afternoon meeting was disturbed this day,<br/> by a singular character, who,
                    I understand, was<br/> often very troublesome. After the meeting had<br/> sat
                    some time in silence, he got up, and, with a<br/> loud violent gesticulation,
                    declared that<br/> he came there that day, in order to bear his solemn<br/>
                    testimony against silent meetings. </p>

<p>This day was mostly employed<br/> in packing up my luggage, and putting it on
                    board<br/> the ship. </p>

<div type="entry">

<p>This morning, between six<br/> and seven o'clock, I went on board the Oliver<br/>
                    Elsworth, attended by several friends of New-York,<br/> who kindly accompanied
                    us, and remained until<br/> the ship weighed and or about eight o'clock. I<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_282" n="282"></pb> then took a final farewell of <q>this delightful<br/> land,</q> in
                    which, although I have met with many<br/> things to try my faith and patience, I
                    have<br/> nevertheless met with kind-hearted, affectionate<br/> friends; many of
                    whom feel nearer and dearer to<br/> me than I have language to express; and
                    whose<br/> kindness and hospitality, I trust, will never be<br/> effaced from my
                    memory. </p>
<p>Although a voyage to America may be consi-<br/> dered as a laborious and perilous
                    undertaking, yet<br/> have thought myself well repaid, in the pleasing<br/>
                    event of many amiable and worthy friends having<br/> thereby been added to the
                    list of my acquaintance;<br/> whom, in all probability, I should otherwise
                    never<br/> have known; and who, as to myself, would have<br/> been as though
                    they had never been. </p>
<p>As the loss of friends by death or otherwise,<br/> may be considered as one of
                    the severest of priva-<br/> tions to a sensible mind; so, on the other
                    hand,<br/> any addition to the number may be truly consi-<br/> dered as one of
                    the most valuable acquisitions.<br/> Yet such are our various propensities, that
                    many,<br/> no doubt, look upon the satisfaction arising from<br/> sources of
                    this kind, as little better than the phan-<br/> toms of the imagination: and not
                    to be compared<br/> with the pleasures arriving from wealth or worldly<br/>
                    honours. </p>
<p>Having weighed anchor, and got all sails<br/> spread, we glided gently along,
                    having but little<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_283" n="283"></pb> wind. The weather being fine and clear, we had<br/> a beautiful
                    autumnal prospect of the country<br/> around us, all the way down to <a href="/places/sandh">Sandyhook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>; and<br/> there being no sickness among
                    the passengers, we<br/> enjoyed the scene. Our company consisted of a<br/>
                    remarkable diversity as to the countries whence<br/> they came. One came from
                    Delhi in Persia;<br/> two were Hindoos, a man and woman; one came<br/> from
                    Berbice in South America; one from Jamaica;<br/> one from Ireland; one from
                    Scotland; four from<br/> England; and one was a military officer from<br/>
                    Bengal. Besides these, the Captain and Mate<br/> of the ship were North
                    Americans, and the ship's<br/> Steward was a native of Germany. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding this great national variety, in<br/> our cabin's company, and a
                    great diversity in reli-<br/> gious profession, yet considerable harmony
                    pre-<br/> vailed; which in a great measure arose from the<br/> constitution of
                    our little republic, the government<br/> of which was formed, at the request of
                    the Cap-<br/> tain, in the outset of the voyage. The plan<br/> adopted was to
                    divide the company in the cabin,<br/> into three committees, who took the
                    government<br/> into their hands by turns; each having the direction<br/> of
                    affairs for a certain number of days in rotation;<br/> during which the Steward
                    and Cook applied to the<br/> acting committee for instructions, in all
                    affairs<br/> relative to eating and drinking; these being mat-<br/> ters in
                    which the judgment of passengers is very<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_284" n="284"></pb> likely to differ; especially when consisting of na-<br/> tives of
                    so many different parts of the world. The<br/> Captain foreseeing this, had
                    wisely proposed to us<br/> this mode of arrangement, and thus removed all<br/>
                    responsibility from himself, whilst it left him more<br/> fully at liberty to
                    manage the ship. </p>
<p>A little before we left <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, there
                    had<br/> been some very boisterous weather, the effects<br/> of which we had an
                    opportunity of noticing, as<br/> we passed by <a href="/places/sandh">Sandyhook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>; where we saw several<br/> vessels which had suffered
                    severely. One in par-<br/> ticular had lost all her masts, and was
                    endeavour-<br/> ing to make her way to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, by means of a<br/> little canvas spread upon some
                    temporary poles,<br/> which they had set up. Another had her top-mast<br/>
                    broken off, and still hanging by the rigging; how-<br/> ever the weather was
                    then clear and calm, and for<br/> several days no sickness appeared amongst
                    us.<br/> For twelve days we made but very slow progress;<br/> but on the
                    thirteenth day we got upon the <a href="/places/bnewf">Banks of
                        Newfoundland<placename key="bnewf"></placename></a>, where the vessel was stopped<br/> a few hours,
                    during which we took some fish;<br/> after which we hoisted our sails and
                    cleared the<br/> Banks early the next day. </p>
<p>A little before we reached the Banks, the wea-<br/> ther being very fine and
                    calm, we discovered a sail<br/> to the eastward, which like ourselves, made
                    but<br/> very little progress; yet, in the course of the fore-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_285" n="285"></pb>noon, we came within five or six miles of each<br/> other, when the
                    wind nearly died away, and the<br/> sea became as smooth as a fish-pond. As the
                    ship<br/> in sight was deemed likely to be coming from<br/> England, some of our
                    people had a great desire to<br/> get along-side of her, in order to inquire
                    what news<br/> she brought. The boat was in consequence let<br/> down into the
                    sea, and the mate and several pas-<br/> sengers got in and rowed away, until
                    they had an<br/> opportunity of getting on board; when they found<br/> that she
                    was a ship bound to Philadelphia from<br/> Rotterdam. </p>
<p>After leaving this vessel, a young man from<br/> Manchester having a desire to
                    bathe in the sea,<br/> all being smooth and calm, stripped himself for<br/> that
                    purpose. The Captain of the Philadelphia<br/> ship observing this, took his
                    speaking trumpet,<br/> and warned him against going into the sea; as they<br/>
                    had observed a large shark hovering about them<br/> all the morning; but the
                    young man supposing he<br/> was only in jest, paid no regard to him, and
                    leaped<br/> into the sea, where he swam about a little time,<br/> and then got
                    safely into the boat again. How-<br/> ever, on the boat's approaching our
                    vessel, the<br/> shark was discovered in company with her, watch-<br/> ing for
                    his prey, and continued hovering round<br/> our ship for some time. Looking at
                    all the cir-<br/> cumstances of the case, it may be considered a<br/> singular
                    and wonderful preservation, that this<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_286" n="286"></pb> young man was not devoured; for had he con-<br/> tinued one minute
                    longer in the water, in all pro-<br/> bability he would have been destroyed. By
                    this<br/> little excursion of the boat I saw the extreme<br/> folly and danger
                    of leaving a ship at sea, even in<br/> the finest weather; except in cases of
                    absolute<br/> necessity; for this boat had not got above half<br/> way to the
                    other ship, when a squall came on with<br/> a thick haze, by which we lost sight
                    of them, and<br/> they of us. Had this state of the weather con-<br/> tinued but
                    for a few hours, they, in all likelihood,<br/> would have been lost. When this
                    alteration in the<br/> weather took place, and the boat disappeared, I<br/>
                    confess I was extremely alarmed; although, on the<br/> company's leaving the
                    ship, I gave one of them a<br/> small pocket compass, fearing that by some
                    acci<br/> -dent, they might be separated from us. On my<br/> expressing my fears
                    to the Captain, he said that<br/> he scarcely knew a boat leave the ship in a
                    calm<br/> like this, but a squall of wind came on. </p>

<p>On the 14th day of our voyage, being the <date when="1806-09-23">23d of<br/> the
                        9th month</date>, after taking soundings on the <a href="/places/bnewf">Banks<placename key="bnewf"></placename></a>,<br/> the wind freshened, and being in our favour,
                    we<br/> sailed about 220 miles, and on the 15th day, the<br/> wind still
                    increasing, we sailed about 230 miles in<br/> our direct course. On the evening,
                    between seven<br/> and eight o'clock, we descried a ship going right<br/> before
                    the wind, like ourselves, with all sails set;<br/> and by ten o'clock, being
                    about two hours and a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_287" n="287"></pb> half, we came up with her, and passing close by,<br/> we found her
                    to be the British Packet from<br/> Halifax. In passing, we observed the men
                    were<br/> all at their guns, with lighted matches, supposing<br/> our ship was
                    an enemy in pursuit of them. We<br/> soon lot sight of them, our vessel being
                    much<br/> the better sailor. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1806-09-25"></date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>On the <date when="1806-09-25">16th day</date> we sailed near 220 miles, and<br/>
                    on the 17th day about 140 miles; on the 18th<br/> about 220 miles; on the 19th
                    about 120 miles;<br/> and on the 20th day about 240 miles. Sailing in<br/> this
                    rapid manner, the motion of the ship through<br/> the waves caused a foam as
                    white as milk; a long<br/> train of which might be seen to a great distance<br/>
                    behind the vessel; and the hissing noise the ship<br/> produced, excited the
                    idea of a huge mass of red<br/> hot iron, passing through the water. On the
                    21st<br/> day of our voyage, we sailed about 120 miles; on<br/> the 22d day
                    about 120, and on the 23d about 250;<br/> and this day we made soundings off
                    Cape Clear.<br/> Thus, from the 14th to the 23d, being the space<br/> of 9 days,
                    we sailed from soundings to soundings<br/> on the two sides of the Atlantic
                    Ocean; a very<br/> short space of time, to traverse so vast a sea.<br/> On the
                    24th day we entered <geogname key="chann">the Channel</geogname>, and<br/> early
                    in the morning passed in sight of Waterford<br/> Light-house. In the course of
                    the day we also<br/> passed the <geogname key="tusco">Tusco Rocks</geogname>,
                    having sailed nearly 120<br/> miles. </p>

<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_288" n="288"></pb>
<dateline><date when="1806-10-04"></date><placename key="holyhead"></placename></dateline>
<p>On the <date when="1806-10-04">25th day,</date> about midnight, we came<br/>
                    close in with the point of <a href="/places/holyhead">Holyhead<placename key="holyhead"></placename></a>; and,
                    about<br/> one in the morning, came in sight of the Skerries<br/> Light-house.
                    This was the last night we were out<br/> at sea, and to me it appeared by far
                    the most<br/> dangerous; for the wind being very high, and the<br/> tide running
                    very strong along this rocky coast,<br/> made so much noise, that the seamen
                    were unable<br/> to hear the captain give his commands; and being<br/> close in
                    with the Isle of Anglesea, we appeared to<br/> be completely land-locked. </p>
<p>I stood by the captain, he requested me to<br/> reach the speaking trumpet, which
                    was the only<br/> time he had occasion to make use of it for this<br/> purpose
                    during the voyage. All was agitation<br/> and bustle for a time; the loud
                    roaring of the<br/> winds and waves was such, that, even aided by<br/> the
                    speaking trumpet, it was with difficulty the<br/> Captain could make himself
                    heard by the poor<br/> seamen, who were aloft in the rigging, using every<br/>
                    exertion to keep the ship from driving upon the<br/> rocks; with the wind
                    blowing right upon them. </p>
<p>I had now crossed the Atlantic four times, but<br/> had not before heard so loud
                    an uproar of winds<br/> and waves as at this period; which, I suppose, was<br/>
                    in part owing to the tide at this time running out<br/> with violence round the
                    point of <a href="/places/holyh">Holyhead<placename key="holyh"></placename></a>, and<br/> adding to the
                    loud howling of the winds in the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_289" n="289"></pb> neighboring mountains, which then appeared<br/> nearly to surround
                    us. These were to me the<br/> most awful moments I had experienced, in all
                    my<br/> travels, and, by those who know any thing of the<br/> coast, our
                    situation may be more easily conceived<br/> than I can describe it. As the ship
                    was thus with<br/> difficulty working her way through the discordant<br/>
                    elements, every moment in danger of striking upon<br/> the rocks, we happily
                    came in sight of the <a href="/places/skerr">Skerries Lights<placename key="skerr"></placename></a>,
                    which removed all our fears. To be re-<br/> lieved from a situation of such
                    great anxiety and<br/> danger, was indeed cause of thankfulness, and I<br/>
                    trust will not soon be forgotten. </p>
<p>Although there were neither moon nor stars<br/> visible, yet the bleak mountains
                    around us were<br/> distinctly seen, and at times did not appear to be<br/> more
                    than a stone's cast from the ship; but this<br/> appearance was in all
                    probability deceptive, as it<br/> was scarcely possible we could have escaped
                    ship-<br/> wreck, had we really been so near the rocks. </p>
<p>Immediately after coming in sight of the Lights,<br/> a signal gun was fired from
                    our ship; and in a few<br/> minutes a pilot-boat came alongside us, and we<br/>
                    took a Pilot on board. The wind about this time<br/> subsiding we gently made
                    our way up <geogname key="chann">the Channel</geogname>;<br/> and early in the
                    morning, cast anchor off the<br/> Cheshire coast, where we remained till
                    day-light<br/> of the 26th day of our voyage, being the <date when="1806-10-05">5th of the<br/><pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_290" n="290"></pb> 10th Month </date>. On arising and going upon
                    deck,<br/> I found we were surrounded by a fleet of near 20<br/> sail of ships,
                    several of them, like ourselves, being<br/> from America, and all waiting the
                    return of the<br/> tide. </p>
<p>The morning being warm and fine, after so<br/> tempestuous a night, we enjoyed
                    the prospect<br/> around us; and, about eleven o'clock, we and the<br/> rest of
                    the vessels in company, weighed anchor.<br/> Having but little wind, most of our
                    sails were<br/> spread to it, and we gently made our way to the<br/> Mersey. In
                    this interval, our cabin company all<br/> sat down to dinner together.
                    Notwithstanding<br/> we were so diversified, both with respect to<br/> country
                    and to habits, and manners; yet, having<br/> been so closely confined within the
                    narrow limits<br/> of the ship; daily eating and drinking together,<br/> and
                    being sharers in every danger, an attachment<br/> was produced, so that I could
                    not avoid feeling a<br/> sensation of seriousness in the reflection, that
                    this<br/> was, in all likelihood, the last time we should meet<br/> together
                    again in this world. </p>
<p>I have sometimes thought it a little remarkable,<br/> that of all the variety of
                    the people we had on board,<br/> if I except a near relation, I received more
                    kind-<br/>ness and attention from the poor Hindoo man,<br/> though he was in the
                    station of a servant, than<br/> from any other person. Although he did not<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_291" n="291"></pb> bear the name of a Christian, yet in Christian<br/> virtues he far
                    excelled many who bear the<br/> name; and I sometimes was ready to wish I<br/>
                    could have entered into his thoughts when he<br/> heard, as was sometimes the
                    case, some of our<br/> Christian passengers, advocating the justice and<br/>
                    propriety of Negro slavery. He himself was of a<br/> darker hue than than many
                    slaves. </p>
<p>On my leaving the ship, there were divers<br/> articles which it was not
                    necessary should pass the<br/> Custom-house; and which I wished to take
                    with<br/> me to my relation's in <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>.
                    On getting<br/> these matters together, and being about to have<br/> them taken
                    away, with the permission of the officer<br/> on board, I was surprised at this
                    kind Hindoo<br/> stepping forward, and insisting upon taking them<br/> to my
                    quarters in the town, where he delivered<br/> them safely at the house of my
                    relation, a distance<br/> of more than a mile from the ship, without
                    accept-<br/> ing any other reward, than the satisfaction of<br/> doing a kind
                    office to one he believed to be his<br/> friend. The articles he took, were
                    mostly natural<br/> curiosities, with some specimens of Indian inge-<br/> nuity;
                    and I was entertained, with the interest which<br/> seemed to be excited in the
                    people who stood<br/> gazing at this friendly Indian, as he traversed the<br/>
                    streets with his burden; both himself and his load<br/> being equally objects of
                    attention to the curious. </p>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_292" n="292"></pb>
<p>It is ever a matter of deep regret to see men,<br/> who profess to be believers
                    in the Gospel of<br/> Christ; and who have had the privilege of read-<br/> ing
                    it, and judging of its excellence, debasing<br/> themselves by the practice of
                    every mean and<br/> sordid vice, allowed by the selfish policy of the<br/>
                    world: on the other hand, it is exceedingly pleas-<br/> ing to behold those,
                    whom, because they have not<br/> had the same privileges, we are ready to
                    designate<br/> by the names of Heathens and Infidels; but who,<br/> by regarding
                    the law in themselves, become exam-<br/>ples of many excellent Christian
                    virtues: Thus<br/> manifesting that God is no respecter of persons. </p>
<p>Being favoured once more to set foot on my<br/> native land, for which I have
                    great cause to be<br/> thankful, J. W. and myself walked up to my<br/>
                    relation's at <a href="/places/milee">Mile-end<placename key="milee"></placename></a>, where we met with
                    a<br/> hospitable and affectionate reception. </p>
<p>After spending this night and the fore part of<br/> the following day with them,
                    we set out in the<br/> long coach for <a href="/places/manch">Manchester<placename key="manch"></placename></a>. In observing the<br/> extreme oppression exercised
                    upon the poor horses,<br/> in these heavy carriages, I found a great draw-<br/>
                    back from the pleasure which otherwise would<br/> have been derived from
                    travelling by land. </p>
<p>We got safe to Manchester the same evening,<br/> where we lodged; and early the
                    next morning, we<br/>
<pb facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_293" n="293"></pb> again took coach, and set off for <a href="/places/sheff">Sheffield<placename key="sheff"></placename></a>, where<br/> we were favoured to arrive safe and well
                    in the<br/> evening; and I had the heartfelt satisfaction of<br/> once more
                    joining my family and friends, after an<br/> absence of more than two years. </p>
<p>In this period I had travelled upwards of ten<br/> thousand miles, without
                    meeting with any unplea-<br/> sant accident. When I consider that in this<br/>
                    space I twice crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and<br/> that sometimes my way lay
                    through the uncleared<br/> forests of America, where I often met with va-<br/>
                    rious tribes of what are called Savage Indians, I<br/> want language to express
                    the feelings of gratitude<br/> which often arise in my breast, for my
                    numerous<br/> preservations and unmerited favours. </p>
<p>Finis. </p>
