                PREFACE.
                <p>The following account of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca Indians<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, was
                    published some<br/> months since, in the columns of The Friend, or Advocate of
                    Truth;<br/> but is now presented to the public, on a larger type, to be sold
                    sepa-<br/>rately, or bound up with an original work upon the <q>Civilization
                        of<br/> the Indian Natives,</q> recently published from the pen of the
                    same<br/> author.</p>
<p>A number of corrections have been made in the original essays, and<br/> some
                    interesting extracts added, from the speeches of the celebrated<br/> Chief,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, during an interview with
                    President <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>Those who feel an interest in the welfare of these Aborigines of our<br/>
                    country, have now an opportunity to rescue from oblivion this sketch<br/> of
                    their history, at a very cheap rate, and in a form much more satis-<br/>factory
                    than that of detached fragments, interspersed with various<br/> other matter,
                    and scattered through several numbers of a periodical in<br/> fine type.</p>
<p>It may not be out of place to insert the following explanatory note,<br/> from
                    the proprietor of the Friend or Advocate of Truth, formerly an<br/> inhabitant
                    of the state of New York:-</p>
<note>When the interior of the state of New York was first explored by Europeans, it
                    was found in the posses-<br/> ion of five distinct and powerful Indian nations,
                    viz.-the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/mohawk">Mohawks<orgname key="mohawk"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagas<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/cayugaind">Cayugas<orgname key="cayugaind"></orgname></a>, and<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>. These five nations, though independent,
                    like the individual states of the present American union,<br/> had formed
                    themselves into a confederated government, for the purpose of general defence,
                    and held their<br/> grand national councils at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/onond">Onondaga<placename key="onond"></placename></a>, the centre point of the five separate sovereignties.
                    <br/>In the early part of the last century, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroras<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> removed from the south to the western part of the<br/>
                    state of New York, and were received into the confederacy, from which time the
                    term 'Six Nations' has<br/> been used for general distinction.</note>

<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_003" n="5"></pb>
                An Account of the Seneca Indians
                <p>As the present seems to be an interesting crisis respecting the abori-<br/>gines
                    of our country, and particularly some of the southern tribes,<br/> whose
                    precarious situation has awakened the feeling, and excited the<br/> sympathies
                    of an enlightened public; and as memorials have been pre-<br/>sented to
                    congress, with a view of protecting this much injured race of<br/> mankind in
                    their rightful possessions, it may, perhaps, be a means of<br/> increasing our
                    sympathies for the Indian tribes, to bring into view the<br/> situation of those
                    more contiguous to our borders. For if the faith of<br/> the United States is
                    once broken, to favour the claim of any individual<br/> state, and the solemn
                    pledges, made by President <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, to
                    pro-<br/>tect the Indians in the possession of their land, are violated, to the
                    ex-<br/>pulsion of one nation or tribe, then the fate of the Indian is sealed.
                    He<br/> is no longer secure within the boundaries of this great republic.
                    As<br/> he becomes obnoxious to those of a fairer skin, and the little land
                    he<br/> posesses, like Naboth's vineyard, is convenient for his master's use,
                    he<br/> is then to be extirpated from the inheritance of his fathers, and
                    dri-<br/>ven from valley to mountain, and from mountain to hill, until his
                    feeble<br/> voice is scarcely heard even among the western wilds.</p>
<p>Although we hope better things of the legislators of our country, and<br/>
                    indulge a glimmering hope, that they will still continue their protection<br/>
                    to the aboriginal lords of the soil who kindly received and made room<br/> for
                    our forefathers when they first landed on their shores; and minis-<br/>tered to
                    their necessities, when they were strangers in a strange land;<br/> yet, from
                    the measures in operation by some of the southern and west-<br/>ern states, with
                    regard to the Indian tribes within their limits, we can-<br/>not but entertain
                    fears for their safety. It is therefore desirable, at<br/> least, to retain a
                    history of those sons of the forest, who have made<br/> some progress in the
                    civilized arts, and with a view of developing their<br/> native character, as
                    well as their progress in civilization, the writer of<br/> this article designs
                    to offer, through the medium of the Friend, or Ad-<br/>vocate of Truth, some
                    account of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, whose
                    situation,<br/> perhaps, above all others, would entitle them to the strongest
                    claims of<br/> protection from the general government.</p>
<p>At a treaty held at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/canan">Canandaigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, under the
                    authority of the United <br/>States, with the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/Six Nations">Six
                        Nations<orgname key="Six Nations"></orgname></a>, dated the <date when="1794-11-11">eleventh of November,
                        1794</date>, 
                    <br/>after describing the boundaries of the lands belonging to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca  Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, the treaty further states- Now
                    the United States acknowledge <br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_004" n="6"></pb> all land within the afore-mentioned
                    boundaries to be the property of<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca
                        nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>; and the United States will never claim the same,<br/> nor
                    disturb the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, nor any of the
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/Six Nations">Six Nations<orgname key="Six Nations"></orgname></a>, or any of<br/> their
                    Indian friends residing thereon, and united with them in the free<br/> use and
                    enjoyment thereof; but it shall remain their's until they choose<br/> to sell
                    the same to the people of the United States, who have the right<br/> to
                    purchase.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> of Indians, previous to a sale
                    they made in the<br/> year 1797, were the proprietors of the greater part of the
                    land west<br/> of the <geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname>, in the
                    state of New York. </p>
<p>By an indenture, bearing date the <date when="1797-09-15">fifteenth of
                        Ninth-month, 1797</date>,<br/> they sold to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/rmorr1">Robert
                        Morris<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a>, in consideration of one hundred thousand<br/> dollars, to
                    be by the said Robert Morris vested in the stock of the<br/> bank of the United
                    States, and held in the name of the president of<br/> the United States, for the
                    use and behoof of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> of<br/>
                    Indians, they bargained and sold a large tract of cuintry mentioned in<br/> said
                    indenture, to the said Robert Morris, excepting, nevertheless, and<br/> always
                    reserving out of this grant and conveyance, all such pieces<br/> and parcels of
                    the aforesaid tract, and such privileges thereunto be-<br/>longing, as is
                    therein afterwards particularly mentioned, which said<br/> pieces or parcels of
                    land so excepted, are, by the parties to the presents<br/> clearly understood to
                    remain the property of the said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca
                    nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/> of Indians, in as full and ample a manner as if the said
                    presents<br/> had not been executed.</p>
<p>Agreeably to the provisions made by the treaty, these reservations<br/> were
                    located to the Indians in such places and manner as were desired<br/> by the
                    sachems and chiefs. The principal reservations were, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/alleg1">Alle-ghany<placename key="alleg1"></placename></a>, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta1">Cattaraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a>, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>,
                    and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tonne">Tonnewonta<placename key="tonne"></placename></a>, with several<br/> smaller
                    reservations near the <geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname>,
                    containing in all three<br/> hundred and twelve square miles, or nearly two
                    hundred thousand<br/> acres.</p>
<p>The noted Chief <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, and his family or
                    tribe, resided in<br/> Pennsylvania, a little south of the state of New York, on
                    a tract of<br/> land secured to him and his heirs forever, by a special act of
                    the state.</p>
<p>This Chief (whose Indian name is Ki-on-twogh-ky,) was much<br/> esteemed for his
                    wisdom and superior skill, in directing the great coun-<br/>cils of the nation;
                    and finer specimens of pathetic eloquence are scarcely<br/> to be met with in
                    the annals of history, either amongst savage or civil-<br/>ized nations, than
                    are displayed in his speeches to President <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gwash1">Washing-ton<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, in the year 1790, when he, with several other
                    noted chiefs, visited<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. These speeches, with the
                    President's answers, the famous<br/> Chief had recorded in a book, of which the
                    writer obtained a copy in<br/> the year 1800. They were printed some years since
                    by the committee<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_005" n="7"></pb> who had the charge of promoting civilized
                    habits among the Indians-<br/> but are rarely to be met with at present. Our
                    limits will not admit<br/> their republication here, but to give the reader some
                    specimens of the<br/> superior powers of mind with which this native son of the
                    forest was<br/> endowed, we will here give a few extracts from them, as also of
                    the<br/> President's replies.</p>

<p>Father, The voice of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>
                            speaks to you, the Great<br/> Counsellor in whose heart the wise men of
                            all the Thirteen Fires have<br/> placed their wisdom. It may be very

<p>When you gave us peace, we called you Father, because you pro-<br/>mised

<p>Father, when you kindled your Thirteen Fires separately, the<br/> wise

                            children of one great Father, who regards also the red people as<br/>
                            his children. They called us brothers, and invited us to his
                            protection.<br/> They told us that he resided beyond the great waters,
                            where the sun<br/> first rises - that he was a king, whose power no
                            people could resist - <br/> and that his goodness was as bright as that
                            sun. What they said went<br/> to our hearts. We accepted the invitation,
                            and promised to obey him.<br/> What the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca
                                nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> promise, they faithfully perform - and when<br/>
                            you refused obedience to that king, he commanded us to assist his
                            be-<br/>loved men in making you sober. We obeyed him - we did no
                            more<br/> than yourselves had led us to promise. The men who claimed
                            this pro-<br/>mise, told us that you were children, and had no guns,
                            that when they<br/> had shaken you, you would submit - we hearkened to
                            them, and were<br/> deceived, until your army approached our towns. We
                            were deceived;<br/> but your people, in teaching us to confide in that
                            king, had helped to<br/> deceive us, and now we appeal to your heart -
                            is all the blame ours?</p>
<p>Father, When we saw that we had been deceived, and heard the<br/>
                            invitation you gave us to draw nigh to the fire which you had
                            kindled,<br/> and talk with you concerning peace, we made haste towards
                            it. You<br/> then told us that we were in your hand, and that by closing
                            it, you<br/> could crush us to nothing-and you demanded from us a great
                            country<br/> as the price of that peace you had offered to us, as if our
                            want of <br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_006" n="8"></pb> strength had destroyed our rights.
                            Our chiefs had felt your power, and<br/> were unable to contend against
                            you, and they, therefore, gave up that<br/> country. What they agreed
                            to, has bound our nation; but by this time<br/> your anger against u
                            must be cooled, and although our strength has<br/> not increased, nor
                            your power become less, we ask you to consider<br/> calmly - were the
                            terms dictated to us by your commissioners reasona-<br/>ble and
                                just?<note resp="author">[After setting forth, in a plaintive
                                strain, the many wrongs they had<br/> suffered, and the difficulties
                                they had been led into by subsequent<br/> treaties with individuals,
                                they go on, and say,]</note> Father, We could<br/> bear this
                            confusion no longer, and determined to lift up our voice, so<br/> that
                            you might hear us, and to claim that security in possession of our<br/>
                            lands, which your commissioners so solemnly promised us, and we now<br/>
                            entreat you to inquire into our complaints, and redress our wrongs.<br/>
                            We have already said how we came to join against you: - we saw that<br/>
                            we were wrong - we wished for peace - you demanded a great country<br/>
                            to be given up to you as the price of peace; and we ought to have<br/>
                            peace, and possession of the little land you then left us.</p>
<p>Father, We will not conceal from you that the great God, and not<br/>
                            man, has preserved the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
                            from the hands of his own nation,<br/> for they ask continually, 'where
                            is the land on which our children, and<br/> their children after them,
                            are to lay down upon?' 'You told us,' say<br/> they, 'that the line
                            drawn from Pennsylvania to <geogname key="lakeo">Lake
                            Ontario</geogname>, would<br/> mark it forever on the east, and the line
                            running from <geogname key="beave">Beaver Creek</geogname><br/> to
                            Pennsylvania would mark it on the west; and we see that it has not<br/>
                            been so - for first one, and then another, comes and takes it away,
                            by<br/> order of that people who you tell us promised it to us.' He is
                            silent,<br/> for he has nothing to say. When the sun goes down, he opens
                            his heart<br/> before God, and earlier than the sun appears again upon
                            the hill , he<br/> gives thanks for his protection during the night
                            season - for he feels that<br/> when men become desperate by their
                            danger, it is God only that can<br/> preserve him. He loves peace, and
                            all that he had in store he has<br/> given to those who have been robbed
                            by your people, lest they should<br/> plunder the innocent to repay
                            themselves. The whole season which<br/> others have employed in
                            providing for their families, he has spent in en-<br/>deavouring to
                            preserve peace, and at this moment his wife and children<br/> are lying
                            on the ground in want of food - his heart is in pain for them<br/> - but
                            he perceives that the Great Spirit will try his firmness in doing<br/>
                            what is right. </p>
<p>Father, All the land we have been speaking of, belonged to the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/Six Nations">Six Nations<orgname key="Six Nations"></orgname></a>. No part of it ever
                            belonged to the King of England, and<br/> he could not give it to you.
                            The land we live on, our fathers received<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_007" n="9"></pb> from God, and they transmitted it
                            to us for our children, and we cannot<br/> part with it.</p>
<p>Father, These are to us very great things - we know that you are<br/>
                            very strong - and we have heard that you are wise - and we shall
                            now<br/> wait to hear your answer to what we have said, that we may
                            know<br/> that you are just.</p>

                    respecting<br/> the sale of their lands, he says, </p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1790"></date><placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I am not uninformed that the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/Six Nations">Six
                                Nations<orgname key="Six Nations"></orgname></a> have been led into some difficulty with respect to
                            the sale of<br/> their lands, since the peace - but I must inform you
                            that these evils<br/> arose before the present government of the United
                            States was esta-<br/>blished, when the separate states and individuals
                            under their authority<br/> undertook to treat with the Indian tribes
                            respecting the sale of their<br/> lands. But the case is now entirely
                            altered - the general government,<br/> only, has the power to treat with
                            the Indian nations, and any treaty<br/> formed and held without its
                            authority, will not be binding.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the security for the remainder of your lands - no<br/>
                            state or person can purchase your lands, unless at some public
                            treaty<br/> held under the authority of the United States. The general
                            govern-<br/>ment will never consent to your being defrauded, but will
                            protect<br/> you in all your rights.</p>
<p>Hear well, and let it be heard by every person in your nation, that<br/>
                            the President of the United States declares that the general
                            govern-<br/>ment considers itself bound to protect you in all the land
                            secured to<br/> you by the treaty at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort
                                Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, <date when="1784-10-22">the twenty-second of
                                October,<br/> 1784</date>, except such parts as you may since have
                            fairly sold to persons<br/> properly authorized to purchase of you.</p>
<p>Your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands,<br/>
                            and I have, therefore, upon this point, meant to be sufficiently
                            strong<br/> and clear, that in future you cannot be defrauded of your
                            lands - that<br/> you possess the right to sell, and the right of
                            refusing to sell your lands<br/> - that, therefore, the sale of your
                            lands in future, will depend entirely<br/> upon yourselves.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>In the conclusion of his speech, the President assures them the<br/> United
                    States will be true and faithful to their agreement.</p>

<p>Father, Your speech, written on the great paper, is to us like the<br/>
                            first light of the morning to a sick man, whose pulse beats too
                            strongly<br/> in his temples - he sees it, and rejoices, but is not
                            cured.</p>
<p>You have spoken plainly on the great point, that you will protect<br/> us
                            in the land secured to us at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort
                                Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, and that we have a right<br/> to sell, or
                            refuse to sell-this is very good. But our nation complain<br/> that you
                            compelled us at that treaty to give up too much of our lands<br/> - we
                            confess that our nation is bound by what was there done, and<br/>
                            acknowledge your power - we have now appealed to yourselves against<br/>
                            that treaty, as made while you were too angry at us - and,
                            therefore,<br/> unreasonable and unjust - to this you have given us no
                            answer.</p>
<p>Father, That treaty was not with a single state - it was the
                            thir-<br/>teen states. We should never have given all that land to one
                            state -<br/> we know that it was before you had the great authority -
                            and as you<br/> have more wisdom than the commissioners who forced us
                            into that treaty,<br/> we expect you have more regard to justice, and
                            will now, at our re-<br/>quest, reconsider the treaty, and restore to us
                            part of that land.</p>
<p>Father, The land which lies between the line running south from<br/>
<geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> to the boundary of
                            Pennsylvania, as mentioned in the treaty<br/> of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, and the eastern boundary of that land
                            which you sold<br/> and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>
                            confirmed to Pennsylvania, is the land on which <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Half-town<persname key="halft1"></persname></a> and all his people live, with other
                            chiefs, who always were, and<br/> still are, dissatisfied with the
                            treaty of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>. They grew
                            out<br/> of this land, and their fathers grew out of it, and they cannot
                            be per-<br/>suaded to part with it. We therefore entreat you to restore
                            us this<br/> little piece.</p>
<p>Father, Look at the land which we gave to you at that treaty, and<br/>
                            then cast your eyes upon what we now ask you to restore us, and you<br/>
                            will see that what we now ask is a very little piece. By giving it
                            back<br/> again you will satisfy the whole of our nation. The chiefs who
                            signed<br/> that treaty will be in safety - and peace between your
                            children and<br/> our children will continue so long as your land shall
                            continue to join<br/> our's.</p>
<p>Every man in our nation will then turn his eyes away from all the<br/>
                            other land that we then gave up to you, and forget that our fathers<br/>
                            ever said that it belonged to them.</p>
<p>Father, We see that you ought to have the path at the carrying-<br/>place
                            from <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> to <geogname key="niaga">Niagara</geogname>, as it was marked down at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort Stan-wix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, and we are willing it should remain
                            to be yours. And if you de-<br/>sire to reserve a passage through the
                                <geogname key="conew">Conewango</geogname>, and through the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_009" n="11"></pb>
<geogname key="chaut"> Chautauque Lake</geogname>, and land for a path
                            from that Lake to <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>,<br/> take
                            it where you like best. Our nation will rejoice to see it an open<br/>
                            path for you and your children, while the land and water remain:
                            But<br/> let us pass along the same way, and continue to take the fish
                            of these<br/> waters in common with you.</p>
<p>Father, You say that you will appoint an agent to take care of<br/> us -
                            let him come and take care of our trade, but we desire he may<br/> have
                            nothing to do with our land; for the agents who have come among<br/> us,
                            and pretended to take care of us, have always deceived us when-<br/>ever
                            we sold lands: both when the King and when the separate states<br/> have
                            bargained with us: They have, by this means, occasioned many<br/> wars,
                            and we are, therefore, unwilling to trust them again.</p>
<p>Father, When we return home, we will call a great council, and<br/>
                            consider well how lands may be hereafter sold by our nation, and
                            when<br/> we have agreed upon it, we will send you notice thereof-but we
                            de-<br/> sire that you will not depend upon your agent for information
                            concern-<br/>ing lands; for after the abuses which we have received from
                            such men,<br/> we will not trust them with anything concerning
                            lands.</p>
<p>Father, We will not hear lies concerning you, and we desire you<br/> will
                            not hear lies concerning us, and then we shall certainly live in<br/>
                            peace with you.</p>
<p>Father, Our nation has long looked round for a father, but they<br/>
                            found none that would own them for his children, until you now tell
                            us<br/> that your courts are open for us as to your own people. The joy
                            that<br/> we feel on this great news so mixes with the sorrows that are
                            past, that<br/> we cannot express our gladness, nor conceal the
                            remembrance of our<br/> affliction - we will speak of it at another
                            time.</p>
<p>Father, We are ashamed that we have listened to L-----n's lies,<br/> or
                            been influenced by threats of war from P-----s, and would hide that<br/>
                            whole transaction from the world and from ourselves, by quietly
                            re-<br/>ceiving what P-----s promised to give us for the land he cheated
                            us of.<br/> But as P-----s will not pay us according to that fraudulent
                            bargain, we<br/> must lay the whole proceeding before your court. When
                            the evidence<br/> which we can produce is heard, we think it will appear
                            that the whole<br/> bargain was founded upon lies which he placed one
                            upon another - that<br/> the goods which he had charged to us, as part
                            payment, were plunder-<br/>ed from us - and that if P-----s was not
                            directly concerned in the theft,<br/> he knew of it at the time, and
                            concealed it from us, and that the per-<br/>sons we confided in were
                            bribed by him to deceive us in the bargain -<br/> and if these facts
                            appear, your courts will not say that such bargains<br/> are just, but
                            set the whole aside.</p>
<p>Father, the blood that was spilt near <geogname key="pinec">Pine
                                Creek</geogname>, is covered, and<br/> we shall never look where it
                            lies. We know that Pennsylvania will<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_010" n="12"></pb> satisfy us for that which we speak
                            to them, wherefore we speak to you.<br/> The chain of friendship will
                            now, we hope, be made strong, as you desire<br/> it to be - we will hold
                            it fast - our end of it shall never rust in our hands.</p>
<p>Father, we told you what advice we gave to the people you are<br/> now at
                            war with, and we now tell you that they have promised to come<br/> again
                            next spring to our towns. We shall not wait for their coming,<br/> but
                            set out very early in the season, and how them what you have<br/> done
                            for us, which must convince them that you will do for them every<br/>
                            thing that they ought to ask. We think they will hear us and
                            forward<br/> our advice.</p>
<p>Father, you gave us leave to speak our minds concerning the till-<br/>ing
                            of the ground - we ask you to teach us to plough and to grind corn,<br/>
                            and supply us with broad axes, saws, augers, and other tools to assist
                            us<br/> in building a saw mill, that we may make our houses more
                            comfortable<br/> and more durable. That you will send smiths among us,
                            and above all<br/> that you will teach our children to read and write,
                            and our women to<br/> spin and weave. The manner of doing these things
                            for us we leave to<br/> you who understand them, but we assure you that
                            we will follow your<br/> advice as far as we are able.</p>

<p>To this second speech the President made them a written reply, stat-<br/>ing,
                    among other things, that he could not disannul treaties made with<br/> the
                    United States before his administration, and that, therefore, the<br/>
                    boundaries marked by the treaty of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fstan">Fort
                        Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a> must remain esta-<br/>blished. He assured them an agent
                    should be appointed who would not<br/> be suffered to defraud them, or assist in
                    defrauding them of their land;<br/> and concluded, by saying -</p>
<p><said who="gwash">You may, when you return from this city to your own
                        country,<br/> mention to your nation my desire for their prosperity by
                        teaching them<br/> the use of domestic animals, and the manner that the
                        white people<br/> plough and raise so much corn, and if, upon consideration,
                        it would be<br/> agreeable to the nation at large to learn these valuable
                        arts, I will find<br/> such means of teaching them, at such a place within
                        their country as<br/> shall be agreed upon.</said></p>

<p>Father, no Seneca ever goes from the fire of his friend until he has<br/>
                            said to him I am going. We therefore tell you that we are now
                            set-<br/>ting out for our own country.</p>
<p>Father, we thank you from our hearts that we now know there is<br/> a
                            country we may call our own, and on which we may lay down in<br/> peace.
                            We see that there will be peace between your children and<br/> our
                            children, and our hearts are very glad. We will persuade the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> and other western nations to
                            open their eyes, and look to-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_011" n="13"></pb> wards the bed which you have made
                            for us, and to ask of you a bed for<br/> themselves and their children,
                            that will not slide from under them.</p>
<p>Father, we thank you for your presents to us, and rely on your
                            pro-<br/>mise to instruct us in raising corn as the white people do. The
                            sooner<br/> you do this the better for us, and we thank you for the care
                            which you<br/> have taken to prevent bad people from coming to trade
                            among us. If<br/> any come without your license, we will turn them back,
                            and we hope<br/> our nation will determine to spill all the rum that
                            shall hereafter be<br/> brought to our towns.</p>
<p>Father, you have not asked of us any surety for peace on our part,<br/>
                            but we have agreed to send nine <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>
                            boys to be under your care for<br/> education - tell us at what time you
                            will receive them, and they shall<br/> be sent at that time. This will
                            assure you that we are indeed at peace<br/> with you, and determined to
                            continue so. If you can teach them to be<br/> wise and good men, we will
                            take care that our nation shall be willing<br/> to be instructed by
                            them.</p>

<p>The foregoing extracts may serve to show the strong point of view<br/> in which
                    the faith of the United States was pledged to protect the In-<br/>dians in their
                    rightful possessions. And this interview with the Presi-<br/>dent opened the way
                    for the introduction of civilized habits among the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> of Indians, subsequently commenced
                    and prosecuted by<br/> the society of Friends. Some account of their proceedings
                    may here-<br/>after be given, in which the writer of this was for many years
                    actively<br/> engaged. It is, in the first place, his design to give a sketch of
                    their<br/> manners and customs, at the time these operations were commenced
                    -<br/> being the result of observation, during his residence and frequent
                    visits<br/> among the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, as well as
                    from the most authentic infor-<br/>mation collected from other well acquainted
                    with their habits and<br/> manners.</p>
<p>This sketch, written many years ago, will consist in a brief view of<br/> their
                    persons, dress, houses, provisions - hardships imposed upon the fe-<br/>males,
                    economy, intercourse with one another, treatment of their chil-<br/>dren,
                    employment of the men - hunting, their belief in the Great Spirit,<br/> opinion
                    of the evil spirit, place of happiness after death, place of punish-<br/>ment,
                    religious ceremonies, sacrifices, mourning for the dead, supersti-<br/>tious
                    notions, banquets, marriages, government, mode of appointing<br/> chiefs,
                    punishments, hyeroglyphics, idea of the globe, &amp;c.</p>

<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_012" n="14"></pb>
                Manners and Customs of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> of
                    Indians, in the year 1800.
                <p>In their persons, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> are generally of a
                    moderate stature<br/> and well proportioned, though instances of dwarfishness
                    and deformity<br/> are sometimes to be seen among them. Their complexion is of a
                    cop-<br/>per colour, and the hair black - that of the men being generally
                    cut<br/> close, excepting a small tuft on the crown of the head, which is
                    suf-<br/>fered to grow long, and is tied in a small roll on the top, on which
                    they<br/> frequently wear a silver tube, about three inches in length.
                    Some,<br/> also, let small locks grow obliquely projecting over their
                    shoulders.<br/> They very generally extract their beards by means of a spiral
                    spring<br/> ring made of wire, about the common knitting needle size, and
                    about<br/> two inches in length; this being applied to the face, and pressed
                    be-<br/>tween the thumb and finger, forms a kind of pincers, and takes so
                    fast<br/> hold of the beard as readily to extract it. This is also frequently
                    made<br/> use of to extract the hair from the head instead of cutting, and
                    some-<br/>times the operation is performed between their thumb and the
                    blunt<br/> edge of a knife.</p>
<p>Their eyes are black, keen, and penetrating - their countenance open<br/> and
                    engaging in general, and a great object of their vanity is, to give<br/> every
                    possible decoration to their persons, by painting their faces a <br/> variety of
                    colours, among which vermilion and charcoal are their<br/> favourites.</p>
<p>They most generally use the red, but streaks of black are occasion-<br/>ally
                    intermixed. Black mostly denotes trouble; but the red, though it<br/> makes them
                    look fierce, as in time of disturbance, is expressive of war – <br/> so it is
                    also used to denote cheerfulness, and sometimes to hide the true<br/> expression
                    of the countenance - and in this way, when rubbed round<br/> the eyes, it has a
                    wonderful effect.</p>
<p>Their dress is simple and commodious. It consists of tight leggings<br/> reaching
                    above the knee, made of cloth or flannel - a strip of cloth<br/> about a foot
                    wide and three or four feet long, according to the size of<br/> the person, is
                    drawn inwards at each end, and hangs down behind and<br/> before, over a belt
                    tied round the waist for that purpose - the outward<br/> ends of this are
                    frequently ornamented with silver brooches. A close<br/> vest or shirt reaching
                    somewhat below the waist, made of linen or<br/> calico, and in some instances a
                    short waistcoat, with an overcoat of cloth,<br/> or blanketing, (which they call
                    match-coat,) clumsily made, and the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_013" n="15"></pb> addition of moccasins on their feet, and a
                    cap on their head, mostly<br/>/ complete their apparel. The materials of their
                    dress, however, vary<br/> according to the season. In warm weather they are very
                    thinly<br/> clad, and in the winter they generally wrap their blanket round
                    them,<br/> in addition to their other clothing. At times, their head dress is
                    cu-<br/>riously ornamented with large feathers, and the tails of wild
                    animals,<br/> projecting from their ears sideways, some erect, and others
                    flowing be-<br/>hind them. These habiliments are put on, however, as their
                    caprice<br/> suggests, and are generally worn at their feasts and sacrifices, or
                    on ex-<br/>peditions to distant parts, when they make the most antic
                    appearance.</p>
<p>The female dress is formed of much the same material as that of<br/> the other
                    sex, but of somewhat different make and arrangement. They<br/> wear moccasins on
                    their feet, and their leggings are fastened<br/> below the knee. An open garment
                    descending about half down the leg, is fastened<br/> round them by a belt at the
                    waist, and the upper part turned down-<br/>wards, reaching near to the knee,
                    which part is often covered with ri-<br/>bands or embellished with silver
                    brooches, with a considerable degree<br/> of skill and taste.</p>
<p>They wear a short frock or vest, reaching to the waist, flowing<br/> loose about
                    them, and when their business will admit, their blanket is<br/> spread over the
                    whole, and serves them both night and day. Divers<br/> of their garments are
                    fancifully fringed and ornamented with needle<br/> work, set in with beads and
                    porcupine quills, variegated and disposed<br/> with much skill and ingenuity.
                    Their hair is left to grow at full length,<br/> generally falls back, and is
                    tied up in a knot behind, care being taken<br/> to apply to it plentifully of
                    the fat of the bear. Their head-dress con-<br/>sists principally of a simple
                    cap, or hood, made of cloth, or old blanket-<br/>ing, secured together, at one
                    end, and flowing round their neck and<br/> shoulders; but these are seldom worn
                    by the females, except in cold<br/> weather.</p>
<p>Their houses are of different dimensions, from ten to thirty feet<br/> in length,
                    but narrow in proportion. They are built of poles, or small<br/> logs, being
                    about six feet to the square of the eve, and covered with a<br/> very steep roof
                    of bark, which they take off the tree in very broad<br/> pieces, five or six
                    feet long, mostly chestnut, hemlock, or cucumber.<br/> They generally take it
                    from the tree, shave the outside off, and lay it in<br/> a horizontal pile to
                    press, some time before they use it.</p>
<p>The rafters are made of round poles, the lower end dovetailed in the<br/> top log
                    - tied together at the top, and crossed again at smaller dis-<br/>tances by
                    other poles, on which are laid the bark, which is tied to the<br/> poles with
                    the inside rind of hickory or other strong bark.</p>
<p>Two courses thus laid on, generally cover one side of the house, and<br/> the
                    ridge of the roof is made tight by laying broad pieces lengthways,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_014" n="16"></pb> and tying them down as aforesaid. A roof
                    of good bark, thus put on,<br/> will stand water proof for several years, and
                    the labour of renewing it<br/> is not very considerable in a country where
                    timber abounds. In a long<br/> house, the logs are joined together at the ends
                    by means of a gutter<br/> post, which stands perpendicular about midway on each
                    side of the<br/> building, and are neatly notched down at the corners. Some<br/>
                    who wish to live more secure from the cold winds, stop the interme-<br/>diate
                    spaces with moss. The door is almost invariably at one end of<br/> the house,
                    the logs being all cut off except the top and bottom ones,<br/> and fitted into
                    gutter posts, which serve for door cheeks. Two births<br/> or shelvings are made
                    on each side of the house, the lower one about<br/> one foot from the ground, on
                    which they lodge, and the other about five<br/> feet high, on which they throw
                    their household furniture, provisions,<br/> &amp;c. The fire is built in the
                    centre of the house, and a hole left in the<br/> roof directly over it to vent
                    the smoke. There are girders supported by<br/> upright timbers, on which they
                    hang up their corn to dry; a cross-<br/>piece of timber again rests on these,
                    from which withs and wooden<br/> hooks are suspended to hang their kettles on,
                    over the fire, wherein they<br/> cook their provisions.</p>
<p>Some had wigwams,* the walls as well as roofs of which were con-<br/>structed of
                    bark, supported by small poles stuck in the ground, to which<br/> the bark was
                    fastened - the inside of the house much on the same con-<br/>struction as the
                    former. These were not very common in their villages,<br/> but more generally
                    occupied as a temporary residence, when in the<br/> woods making sugar, or as a
                    hunting encampment.</p>
<p>The third month, is generally their season for making sugar, when<br/> whole
                    families retire into the woods contiguous to a grove of sugar<br/> maple, the
                    sap of which they extract, by making an incision into the<br/> trunk near the
                    ground, and convey it, by means of a small tube, into<br/> troughs set for the
                    purpose. This is collected and taken to the camp,<br/> where it is boiled in
                    large kettles till reduced to sugar, and when clean-<br/>liness is observed in
                    the operation, they will make this valuable article<br/> of an excellent flavour
                    and quality. The sap runs most plentifully in<br/> a clear sunshine, after a
                    cold frosty night - but a damp wind from the<br/> southward checks the flowing
                    of the sap immediately.</p>
<p>At this season the Indians remain several weeks in the woods, and<br/> the men
                    assist the women in the labour of making sugar, besides at-<br/>tending to their
                    hunting, to procure supplies of meat. They also trap<br/> those amphibious and
                    other animals, which furnish furs, and especially<br/> the beaver, the meat of
                    which they esteem a luxury.</p>

<p>The females, who are subject, (as amongst other uncivilized nation)<br/> to
                    almost every kind of domestic drudgery, are industrious in the culture<br/> of
                    Indian corn, beans, squashes, melons, potatoes, and many other vege-<br/>tables.
                    And although each family have their separate piece of ground<br/> to cultivate
                    with the hoe, and hold the fruit of their industry as distinct<br/> property,
                    yet they frequently join in large companies to assist each<br/> other, on which
                    occasions they are remarkably loquacious and lively,<br/> as also expert in
                    using the hoe, each patiently assisting her neighbour,<br/> till her own turn
                    comes in rotation. Thus they enjoy a kind of con-<br/>vivial intercourse, which
                    greatly tends to ameliorate the weight of la-<br/>bour assigned them, and in
                    many instances no doubt, affords them a<br/> satisfaction equal to, if not
                    surpaaaing that enjoyed by many of the white<br/> female in their most social
                    entertainments.</p>
<p>The vegetables which they raise with the hoe, with some fish caught<br/> in the
                    river, generally compose a great part of their provision in the<br/> summer
                    season. Venison was not at all time to be procured plentifully,<br/> and even
                    when obtained, by hunting, they had no way of preserving it,<br/> in the warm
                    weather, except by drying it over the fire, into what they<br/> call jerk. This
                    is sometimes done in the woods, at their hunting camps<br/> - by means of a kind
                    of rack made of small sticks, over the fire, or by<br/> sharpening the sticks at
                    both ends and setting them in the ground, near<br/> the fire, with the meat
                    stuck on the upper end. Salt at this time was<br/> a scarce article among them,
                    and not to be procured but at an ex-<br/>travagant price, yet it is an article
                    of which they are very fond, and<br/> what little they were enabled to obtain
                    was frequently carried with<br/> them, carefully tied up in one corner of their
                    clothes, and used sparing-<br/>ly. Their venison was often eaten without salt,
                    bread, or vegetables;<br/> and as they are not delicate in their palate, they
                    often feast, apparently<br/> with a relish, on meat highly tainted. They were
                    not observed to be<br/> early risers in the morning; they seldom eat more than
                    two meals a<br/> day, and those morning and evening. Their meals principally
                    consist<br/> of soups, made of squashes, beans, hominy, and other vegetables;
                    also<br/> of meat cut in small pieces, when it can be procured. This dish is
                    then<br/> served up in wooden bowls, and supped with wooden ladles; the
                    eldest<br/> of the male part of the family being generally served first, and
                    thus in<br/> rotation, to the youngest - afterwards the females partake in a
                    similar<br/> manner. On some extraordinary occasions, they sweeten their
                    soups<br/> with sugar. This article they are very fond of; and as they make
                    it<br/> in cakes of near a pound weight, they frequently carry it with
                    them,<br/> and eat it like cheese, with bread, or sweeten water to drink. </p>
<p>When their new corn becomes fit for use, which is generally in the<br/>
                    ninth-month, they feast plentifully on it, sometimes boiling it, as usual<br/>
                    among white people, and also make soup or dumplings of it, while in a<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_016" n="18"></pb> milky state. The process of the latter is,
                    to cut it off the cob and tie<br/> it up in small cakes, in the corn husks,
                    mixed with whortleberries or<br/> dried blackberries, and boiled like a pudding.
                    This when seasoned<br/> with a little salt, makes a palatable food, and with the
                    addition of some<br/> bear's fat, is to them a luxury.</p>
<p>Their bread is made of corn meal, into which they put bean, mix<br/> it up with
                    hot water, and bake it in the embers. They also parch<br/> their corn, pound it
                    fine, and mix sugar with it. This is a delicacy<br/> even with white people, and
                    frequently forms a part of the Indian's<br/> travelling provisions; wanting no
                    other preparation for eating, than<br/> wetting it with water. They raise a kind
                    of small round squash, which<br/> they boil or roast in the embers, and which,
                    in taste, resembles a sweet<br/> potato; and these they not only use in the
                    autumn, but preserve nearly<br/> through the winter. In times of scarcity, they
                    are often reduced to the<br/> necessity of gathering wild roots and herbs, on
                    which they subsist. In<br/> short, a great variety, prepared in the most simple
                    manner, composed<br/> their provisions. Almost every kind of fowl, fish, and
                    flesh are eaten<br/> by them; even some amphibious animals - and the beaver,
                    especially<br/> - as before stated, was esteemed a luxury.</p>
<p>Having no mills in their country, the women reduced their corn to<br/> meal, by
                    pounding it in wooden mortars, and sifting it in a sieve made<br/> of wooden
                    splints. The pounders were made of hard wood, and of dif-<br/>ferent weights,
                    according to the size and strength of the woman; and<br/> frequently three of
                    them would be engaged in one block at the same<br/> time, and regulate their
                    strokes in alternation.</p>
<p>The females also cut their firewood and carry it home on their<br/> backs; and
                    about some of their ancient villages, oftentimes from a quar-<br/>ter to a half
                    mile distance. This being an arduous part of the task as-<br/>signed them, they
                    frequently join in large companies to assist each other;<br/> and to those who
                    have not been eye-witnesses, it might appear incredi-<br/>ble to relate the size
                    and weight of the burthens they carry tied up in<br/> a belt, which bears on the
                    forehead; the wood being suspended across<br/> the back, as the females incline
                    forward. The young girls are not ex-<br/>empted from this service, but carry
                    small burthens in proportion to<br/> their strength; and these female labourers
                    knowing the task assigned<br/> them, are economical in procuring their wood in
                    the summer, or early<br/> in the fall; having it split up small, carried home,
                    and piled round the<br/> house, or often under a shed made for the purpose. This
                    would be<br/> thought insupportable, by the females of some, if not all
                    civilized na-<br/>tions; but custom and necessity have made it quite familiar to
                    these<br/> sprightly inhabitants of the wilderness.</p>
<p>The economy of the women in procuring sustenance, far exceeds that<br/> of the
                    men, as they carefully collect almost every natural or sponta-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_017" n="19"></pb> neous production of their country,
                    suitable for the support of human<br/> life, and lay up against times of
                    scarcity, which sometimes occur, and<br/> more frequently in the fore part of
                    summer. For though many of them<br/> raise a competence of corn, to serve, with
                    frugality, the year round, yet<br/> others fall short - using their supply so
                    liberally, it is exhausted before<br/> the new corn is fit for use; still
                    trusting to the hazard of procuring food<br/> from their native forests.</p>
<p>When an Indian entered the house of his friend, it was common to<br/> set before
                    him such provisions as were cooked, and if while he was<br/> eating, several of
                    his associates came in, he divided it in equal parts<br/> amongst them;
                    reserving his own proportion. When he is about to<br/> leave his friend, he
                    tells him he is going, which amounts to farewell;<br/> but if any circumstance
                    takes place which has given umbrage, he with-<br/>draws, and says nothing. This
                    is clear evidence that he is offended.</p>
<p>They appear to be naturally as well calculated for social and rational<br/>
                    enjoyment, as any people. --They frequently visit each other in their<br/>
                    houses, and spend much of their time in friendly intercourse.</p>
<p>They are also mild and hospitable, not only among themselves, but<br/> to
                    strangers, and good natured in the extreme, except when their na-<br/>ture are
                    perverted by the inflammatory influence of spirituous liquors.<br/> In their
                    social interviews, as well as public council, they are careful<br/> not to
                    interrupt one another in conversation, and generally make short<br/> speeches.
                    This truly laudable mark of good manners, enables them to<br/> transact all
                    their public business with decorum and regularity, and more<br/> strongly
                    impresses on their mind and memory, the result of their delibe-<br/>rations.
                    Probably it is from this circumstance that they are enabled,<br/> without the
                    aid of literature, to retain in their memory, and transmit<br/> their
                    transactions from one generation to another; thus one of their<br/> chiefs,
                    speaking in public council , will relate with precision, circum-<br/>stances
                    that have taken place among their ancestors for several gene-<br/>rations
                    past.</p>
<p>Although they appear to possess tender feelings for their children,<br/> they
                    inure them to hardships, while in an infant state, by frequently<br/> immersing
                    them in cold water. Being indulged in most of their wishes,<br/> as they grow
                    up, liberty, in its fullest extent, becomes their ruling pas-<br/>sion. They are
                    seldom chastened with blows, or treated with restraint<br/> or correction. Their
                    faults are mostly left for their own reason to cor-<br/>rect when they are grown
                    up - which faults, they say, cannot be very<br/> great, before reason arrives at
                    some degree of maturity. If, however,<br/> they prove too obstinate, they
                    sometimes plunge them in the river; and<br/> if one dip is not sufficient to
                    conquer or quiet them, it is repeated, till<br/> the end is effected. As the
                    child gets a little older, they will sometimes<br/> talk to it a long while,
                    endeavouring to impress on its mind what it<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_018" n="20"></pb> ought to do, and what to leave undone. At
                    other times, they ridicule<br/> their children for doing wrong, and tell them
                    they are not wise in doing<br/> so.</p>
<p>And one remarkable trait in the character of the children, is, that<br/> they are
                    generally good humoured among themselves, and children of<br/> the same family
                    show strong attachments to each other, and are less<br/> liable to quarrel in
                    their youthful days than is generally the case with<br/> white children.</p>
<p>The father, although he assumes little command over his sons, is<br/>
                    nevertheless anxious to instruct them in the necessary qualifications for<br/>
                    hunting, &amp;c. while the mothers are equally attentive to their
                    daugh-<br/>ters, in teaching them every thing that is considered necessary to
                    their<br/> character and mode of living.</p>
<p>On taking a view of their situation, one would naturally suppose the<br/> life of
                    these women was an uninterrupted scene of toil and pain, which,<br/> indeed, in
                    a great measure, it really is; for, besides attending to the<br/> usual labours
                    of the field, and every culinary service, the duties of ma-<br/>ternal care are
                    added, and require a considerable part of their atten-<br/>tion - the men
                    assuming very little of the parental trust.</p>
<p>Providence seems, in a remarkable manner, to have furnished these<br/> females
                    with strength and fortitude adequate to their situation; for, at<br/> those
                    times when the females of civilized nations require the most ten-<br/>der care
                    and solicitude, these hardy daughters of the forest have little<br/> or no
                    respite from their usual labours.</p>
<p>Their children are frequently born in the woods, where the woman,<br/>
                    accompanied by an elderly female, retires on the occasion, and if in<br/> cold
                    weather a fire is made. The babe is immediately wrapt in a blan-<br/>ket, and
                    generally, in a few hours, the mother returns with it to her<br/> own
                    habitation, and engages in her usual employment, without any ap-<br/>parent
                    injury to her health, or constitution.</p>
<p>In the nursing of their children, a very considerable degree of inge-<br/>nuity
                    is manifested; and for convenience of carrying, as also to keep<br/> the limbs
                    of the young child straight, they confine it with it back to a<br/> board, made
                    for the purpose; and often fancifully decorated with va-<br/>rious trinkets, and
                    embroidery. This board is about two feet and a<br/> half in length, and one in
                    breadth, with a little hoop in front, to protect<br/> the head and face of the
                    child, from which also they suspend a curtain<br/> to cover it from flies or
                    cold. At the bottom is a small foot-board, on<br/> which the child is placed in
                    an erect posture, with its hand down its<br/> sides. It is then swathed with a
                    bandage of cloth, from the feet to the<br/> chin, so tight as to be unable to
                    disengage itself. If the weather is cold,<br/> the skin of some animal, with
                    soft fur on it, is put next to it; and if a<br/> female, a small block is placed
                    between the heels to give the toes an<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_019" n="21"></pb> inclination inwards, but if a male, they
                    endeavour to keep the feet in<br/> a direction straight forward. One consequence
                    of this is, that the<br/> track of the different sexes may easily be
                    distinguished. In this vehi-<br/>cle, their children are carried about at
                    pleasure, suspended down the<br/> back by a belt, which comes round the forehead
                    of the mother. When<br/> taken to the woods, or fields, they are occasionally
                    set up against trees<br/> or stumps, while the mother is employed in her
                    customary labours.<br/> Sometimes they are suspended by the four corners to
                    poles laid hori-<br/>zontally on forks stuck in the ground. In this position
                    they are drawn<br/> backwards and forward, a little similar to rocking in a
                    cradle, and on<br/> all occasions they are careful to prevent their children, as
                    much as may<br/> be, from crying. They are loosened from the board a few times
                    in the<br/> day; but being so accustomed to this confinement, and so perfectly
                    at<br/> ease in it, they become uneasy when taken out, and their
                    tranquillity<br/> is restored when replaced. This mode of confinement is
                    continued<br/> about nine months, and is not only advantageous in the nursery,
                    but<br/> also in carrying them with more ease and security.</p>
<p>The chief employment of the men was hunting and fishing, making<br/> canoes,
                    building their houses, dressing deer skin, making bowl, &amp;c.<br/> in all
                    which they were ingenious, considering the tools they had to work<br/> with. In
                    their hunting excursions, they generally take their wives and<br/> families with
                    them, and remain several weeks in the woods, sometimes<br/> twenty, forty, or
                    even one hundred miles from their villages, and gene-<br/>rally up or down a
                    river, or some large stream of water, where they<br/> can go in canoes. And
                    their household furniture being mostly porta-<br/>ble, they carry as much with
                    them as answers their purpose during<br/> their hunting tour. On getting to the
                    place they have chosen for a<br/> hunting ground, they erect a temporary shed,
                    generally so situated as<br/> to command an extensive view of the river, or some
                    smaller stream,<br/> where they may have a favourable opportunity of seeing the
                    deer, or<br/> other wild animals pass and repass, and thus it frequently
                    happens, that<br/> they have an opportunity of shooting them from the door of
                    their cabin.</p>
<p>The man sets out in the morning, generally taking his course along<br/> some
                    stream of water, making, as he travels on, a kind of a way mark,<br/> by once in
                    a while breaking down a bush; and in this way traverses<br/> the country for
                    many miles in the course of the day, exploring the<br/> haunts of the deer or
                    elk, as these animals resort to certain places called<br/> deer licks, with
                    which the country abounds, where the water issuing<br/> from them is somewhat
                    impregnated with salt. When the huntsman<br/> kills a deer, or other animal, he
                    takes off the skin, which he generally<br/> carries with him; and, dividing the
                    carcass in quarters, he hangs it<br/> up in a tree, and then makes his way to
                    the path along the water<br/> course, breaking down the bushes from the deer,
                    till he reaches it,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_020" n="22"></pb> where he scrapes with his feet in the
                    leaves or snow, or otherwise in<br/> case of snow falling to cover his marks on
                    the ground; he cuts down a<br/> bush, and sharpening a stick, sets it in a
                    position pointing in a direct<br/> line to the deer he has killed; this
                    furnishes a mark for his wife to find<br/> the game he has killed, whose
                    business it is to carry it home to their<br/> camp. He then pursues his hunting
                    again, and if he kills several deer<br/> in the course of the day, he marks the
                    way from each in the same man-<br/>ner to the main path by the water; and in the
                    evening returns to his<br/> cabin tired with his day's toil, where his wife
                    furnishes him with a sup-<br/>per of such as she has to prepare. He then relates
                    the success that<br/> has attended him through the day, regales himself with the
                    fumes of<br/> tobacco, and retires to rest on a deer skin, in his native
                    dignity, as abo-<br/>riginal lord of the soil. If too late in the evening when
                    he returns, his<br/> wife goes off next morning, directed by his marks where to
                    find the<br/> deer he has killed, and brings them home on her back, one at a
                    time,<br/> often from a great distance; but in the winter time, when they
                    have<br/> great success in hunting, they leave much of the flesh in the
                    woods,<br/> which is devoured by wolves, or other animals of prey.</p>
<p>They sometimes watch the deer licks in the night season, where those<br/> animals
                    more frequently resort than they do in the day time, and some-<br/>times in
                    great numbers.</p>
<p>The huntsman take his station in the evening at a proper distance,<br/> and
                    kindles a small fire, which he is careful to conceal, until he hears<br/> some
                    deer in the lick, and then having some torches, or dry wood, pre-<br/>sently
                    makes the light shine round about, by which he can discover his<br/> prey, and
                    the poor animals will stand gazing at the light, while he dis-<br/>charges his
                    gun at them. In this manner, they frequently kill several<br/> deer in a
                    night.</p>
<p>As the snow falls deep in their country, frequently from one to three<br/> feet,
                    it renders travelling difficult in the winter. The Indians, there-<br/>fore,
                    have recourse to snow shoes, on which they can travel with much<br/> facility,
                    and sometimes catch the deer by running them down, without<br/> either dog or
                    gun.</p>
<p>These snow shoes are made of a tough piece of wood curved before,<br/> and
                    somewhat of an oval form, making a span of about two feet long,<br/> and perhaps
                    one foot wide, in the middle. Two straight braces cross<br/> this again at
                    proper distances to support the foot, and the intermediate<br/> spaces are laced
                    with great neatness, with thongs of deer or elk skin.<br/> They vary in size
                    according to the person wearing them. On these,<br/> the huntsman wanders over
                    mountain, hill, and dale, in pursuit of the<br/> wild animals of the wood, and
                    should he get benighted at too great a<br/> distance to reach his cabin, and has
                    killed any deer, he strikes up a fire<br/> in the woods, and roasts a ham or
                    shoulder of venison on a sharp stick<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_021" n="23"></pb> stuck in the ground before it; beginning
                    to eat as soon as one side is<br/> done, and sometimes continuing to eat, as his
                    venison cooks, until he is<br/> satisfied or the whole is consumed. It is said
                    that some of the hunters<br/> when very hungry, will eat a ham of venison
                    without much difficulty.<br/> This, in part, may be accounted for, from their
                    sometimes starving a<br/> long time - for in general they are moderate
                    eaters.</p>

                Religious Ceremonies, Government, &amp;c. 
                
                <p>THE Indians believe in one all-wise, Supreme Being, who governs<br/> the
                    universe; and that they will be made happy or miserable in a fu-<br/>ture state,
                    according as their conduct pleases or displeases him, in this<br/> state of
                    existence. This all-wise being they call How-wa-neeo, or<br/> Great Spirit, and
                    believe him to be the creator of all good things, the<br/> author of happiness,
                    and the rewarder of all good actions, both in this<br/> world and in the
                    next.</p>
<p>They believe, also, that there is an evil spirit, which they call
                    Nish-<br/>shee-o-nee, who influences to bad actions, and who is the creator of
                    all<br/> that is bad - such as venomous serpents, wolves, and all warlike
                    beasts,<br/> poisonous weeds, bad thoughts and deeds, and every thing that is
                    pro-<br/>ductive of unhappiness, both in man and on the earth.</p>
<p>They believe there is a place of happiness called in their language<br/>
                    Hight-ca-a-nongay, and that, when they die, if their conduct has been<br/>
                    orderly, and pleasing to the Great Spirit in this world, they are ad-<br/>mitted
                    into this happy region, among the spirits of good men and wo-<br/>men, where the
                    Great Spirit is their comforter and chief ruler - and<br/> that he there hangs
                    about their necks a string of implements for hunt-<br/>ing, and for providing
                    themselves a comfortable living, and that they<br/> are sent to hunt in a warm
                    country, where game is plenty, and the<br/> land fertile for corn, beans, and
                    other vegetables.</p>
<p>Twice in the year, arrayed in their best clothing, and decked with<br/>
                    ornaments, they assemble at the town where their Chief lives, in order<br/> to
                    render thanks to the Great Spirit for the favours which he hath con-<br/>ferred
                    upon them. Their stated period for these ceremonies are in<br/> the beginning of
                    autumn, when their new corn, beans, squashes, pota-<br/>toes, &amp;c. are fit
                    for use, and again about the middle of winter, when<br/> they generally return
                    to their villages with the produce of their hunt-<br/>ing expeditions.</p>
<p>After they are generally collected, both men and women, with the<br/> children,
                    an examination takes place, whether any uneasiness or dis-<br/>satisfaction
                    exist among them, and whether any have committed offences<br/> or evil acts. Of
                    these it is often the case that the offender makes con-<br/>fession, the design
                    of which is, that all wrong things may be done away,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_022" n="24"></pb> and reconciliation take place, where any
                    differences have occurred,<br/> and a promise on the part of the aggressor or to
                    try to do better for the<br/> future; which done, the council then assembled
                    forgive them.</p>
<p>They then institute a dance round or near a wooden image, which<br/> stands a
                    little distance from the Chief's door, being formed of a huge<br/> block of wood
                    into the similitude of a man, and artfully painted; em-<br/>bellished with skin,
                    handkerchiefs, fine ribands, and feathers of a va-<br/>riety of colours. Both
                    sexes join promiscuously in the dance - two<br/> men being seated near the feet
                    of the image, make music by pounding<br/> on a skin drawn over the mouth of a
                    kettle, or some other vessel, the<br/> sound of which has some resemblance to
                    that of a drum. As they<br/> move round in a circle, each one has a spoon,
                    ladle, or some other in-<br/>strument in the left hand, and frequently give a
                    frightful halloo or<br/> scream. The men are all naked from the waist up, and
                    their bodies<br/> painted a variety of hues. They have also various kind of
                    trinkets<br/> suspended from their ears and noses, and abundance of ornaments,
                    such<br/> as belt and deer's hoofs strung like beads, fastened about their
                    legs,<br/> which make a great rattle during the process of the dance.</p>
<p>After a day pent at this general rendezvous, they divide into smaller<br/>
                    companies, men and women apart, and keep up the dance in each<br/> house in the
                    town. These dancing companies are preceded by two<br/> men appointed for the
                    purpose, who are dressed in the most frightful<br/> manner imaginable, being
                    covered with bear skins, and a bag of ashes<br/> tied round their middle, behind
                    them, with a hole to suffer the ashes to<br/> fly about as they move. Their
                    faces are covered with a large painted<br/> mask, having a high mane on the
                    crown, made of long coarse horse<br/> hair standing almost erect, and large eyes
                    encircled with a flame-co-<br/>loured ring. The mouth is open, and shows their
                    own teeth, with<br/> which they grin in a terrific manner, and their hands are
                    blackened so<br/> as to leave the marks on every person they lay them on. They
                    carry<br/> the shell of a mud tortoise, which has been dried for the purpose,
                    with<br/> a stick thrust through it, which stretches the neck and large head
                    to<br/> their full extent, and inside of the shell are a quantity of pebbles,
                    with<br/> which they make a wonderful rattle.</p>
<p>These men go from house to house, and rub this shell on the sides<br/> and up and
                    down the door posts. They also frequently enter into the<br/> house, but say
                    nothing, nor do any injury. As they travel about, if<br/> they meet with any
                    person, male or female, in their way, they pursue<br/> them - those who turn and
                    receive them in a friendly way, they shake<br/> hands with, but say nothing -
                    but it is rather expected that many<br/> should run as if terrified; these are
                    pursued, and if overtaken before<br/> they get into a house, are laid hold of,
                    and blackened with their hands,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_023" n="25"></pb> but no other injury is offered, and,
                    except a frightful yelling noise, no-<br/>thing is spoken.</p>
<p>The design of these frightful representations is, to personify and imi-<br/> tate
                    the bad spirit, and to remind the Indians of the necessity to amend<br/> their
                    ways, and avoid all wrong things.</p>
<p>After this concert of heathenish superstition has continued for seve-<br/>ral
                    days, they assemble again round the wooden image* near the coun-<br/> cil house,
                    and sacrifice a dog, first decorating him with strings of wam-<br/> pum, fine
                    ribands, and some paintings; and after hanging him on the<br/> image, burn him
                    to ashes, on a fire kindled near him for the purpose.<br/> On some extraordinary
                    occasions, they eat the flesh of the dog, and a<br/> white dog is always
                    preferred, as being deemed a more acceptable of-<br/> fering.</p>
<p>While the dog is consuming, they dance round the fire, making a<br/> dreadful
                    yelling and whooping, and during the process of the dance,<br/> about one pound
                    of tobacco, of a particular kind, rubbed fine, which<br/> they consider as
                    peculiarly agreeable to the Great Spirit, is thrown on<br/> the fire, in the
                    smoke whereof, their aspirations, as they suppose, as-<br/> cending, they
                    believe are heard by the Great Spirit, and are offered,<br/> together with their
                    dancing, under a profession of pleasing him.</p>
<p>During this ascension of the smoke, a Chief whom they call their<br/> minister,
                    and who appears to have the command and superintendence<br/> of this ceremony,
                    addresses the Great Spirit in a speech, the purport<br/> of which is an
                    acknowledgment for favours received, thanks for pre-<br/> servation in times
                    past, and imploring his continued care and protection.</p>
<note resp="author">
<p>*About the year 1802 this image, decaying at the ground, fell down. This
                        circum-<br/>stance occasioned very considerable agitation among them, to
                        know in what manner to<br/> dispose of it, without giving offence to the
                        Great Spirit; as they considered it to be his<br/> representative. Some were
                        for taking it into the woods, and leaving plenty of provi-<br/>sions beside
                        it. Others were for erecting another in its stead, and some were for
                        dis-<br/>carding such a representation entirely. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/habee1">son<persname key="habee1"></persname></a> of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, the Chief, who had got his ideas a little
                        expanded by an edu-<br/>cation among white people, reasoned with them on the
                        subject, and told them that it<br/> had grown up in the woods like other
                        trees of the forest; that they had cut it down,<br/> and made it into the
                        form of a man, but it was still nothing but a block of wood, and<br/> had no
                        power or sense, and, therefore, could not represent the Great Spirit, as
                        they<br/> imagined; and if they would give it up to him, he would dispose of
                        it. To this they<br/> reluctantly consented, and on conditions only, that he
                        would take all the responsibility<br/> of any harm happening the nation in
                        consequence thereof. Accordingly he tumbled<br/> it into the river, and let
                        it swim down, the Indians carefully viewing the process, to see<br/> whether
                        any evil would befall him.</p>
<p>Some time after, several of them passing along the river, discovered it
                        lodged on an<br/> island, about eleven miles below its former station, at
                        which they appeared struck with<br/> astonishment, and considerably alarmed,
                        but let it remain as they found it.</p>

<p>He then addresses the people, advising them how they ought to con-<br/>duct, and
                    pointing out some of the prominent evils which they ought to<br/> avoid; one of
                    the greatest of these is stealing, and another is, for the<br/> husband to
                    desert and separate himself from his wife during pregnancy;<br/> but taking the
                    life of another is not considered a crime so capital, as<br/> they are left at
                    liberty to revenge it, by taking the life of the murder-<br/>er. This may be
                    done with impunity by the nearest relative of the<br/> deceased, and they then
                    consider the cries of blood to be done away.<br/> Preparatory to these
                    sacrifices they are careful to procure a sufficien-<br/>cy of provisions.</p>
<p>This is done by deputing a certain number of their warriors to hunt,<br/> who
                    encircle a large space of hunting ground, and all the game taken<br/> thereon is
                    devoted to this feast. Previously to that which was held in<br/> the summer of
                    1799, thirty men were sent out, who returned the day<br/> following with
                    seventeen deer. Great attention is paid to the cooking,<br/> and certain places
                    are appointed where the entertainment shall be<br/> given. Spirituous liquors
                    are not allowed on these occasions, although<br/> near the conclusion there are
                    instances, at times, of some of them get-<br/>ting intoxicated.</p>
<p>Their stated time, according to ancient custom, for holding these
                    sa-<br/>crifices, is four days at a time, twice in the year; but they
                    frequently<br/> continue their feasting and dancing at intervals and by
                    companies, for<br/> eight or ten days; and, after the last day being spent in
                    playing at<br/> games of chance, they generally conclude by the firing of
                    guns.</p>
<p>Their reason for performing these ceremonious rites, at these two<br/> seasons of
                    the year, they say, is to return thanks to the Great Spirit,<br/> for sending
                    them plenty of bread and meat - that it was the way their<br/> forefathers had
                    taught them, and they knew of no better; and although<br/> the feast is
                    conducted with considerable noise, and apparent confusion,<br/> it is also
                    attended at intervals with much solemnity, and on the part of<br/> many of them,
                    purely on a religious ground, and from sincere and good<br/> motives. But, at
                    the same time, they are willing to acknowledge that<br/> their worship was not
                    performed with so much solemnity as their fore-<br/>fathers practised.</p>
<p>Besides their public devotional feasts and sacrifices, the Indians ex-<br/>ercise
                    a kind of family worship, at times, when they are sitting together,<br/>
                    particularly in the evening. If one of the heads of the family feels an<br/>
                    impulse to address the Great Spirit, he, or she, yields to it with an
                    au-<br/>dible voice, and this, among the more serious class, is frequently
                    per-<br/>formed, though not on any stated days or times. They are sometimes<br/>
                    exercised in this way when their friends are with them, and the subject<br/> of
                    aspiration is a thanksgiving for the preservation of their particular<br/>
                    family or tribe, and for supplying the varied necessaries and comforts<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_025" n="27"></pb> of life, desiring their continuance; an
                    evidence, this, that among all<br/> their superstition and ignorance, they are
                    not destitute of the divine<br/> principle operating within them, and raising in
                    their minds a sense of<br/> their dependent state, the obligations they are
                    under to their great pre-<br/> server and benefactor, and the necessity of
                    prayer for the continua-<br/> tion of his blessings and favours.</p>
<p>Though much reserved in expression, with regard to abstruse subjects,<br/> they
                    nevertheless at times manifest an inquisitive disposition respecting<br/> the
                    creation of the world, the formation of man, and whether Indians<br/> and white
                    people go to the same place after death, or whether they<br/> will be all of one
                    language in a future state.</p>
<p>Their funeral rites are observed with great solemnity, and succeeded<br/> by deep
                    mourning. Whatever might have been their ancient custom,<br/> as stated by some
                    writers with respect to a place of general deposit of<br/> the bones of their
                    dead, I find no such tradition among them at the pre-<br/>sent day. A spot of
                    ground contiguous to each village is occupied as a<br/> place of interment, and
                    each grave has a separate covering of boards,<br/> or clefts of wood. The corpse
                    dressed in the best apparel is put into a<br/> coffin made of boards, when they
                    can be procured, or otherwise bark<br/> laid beneath and over it in the grave,
                    and sometimes a new blanket<br/> and small kettle is enclosed with it, and
                    frequently other articles, to<br/> which the deceased was attached while
                    living.</p>
<p> As they believe in the resurrection of the spirit, and that for some<br/> time
                    after death it is common for it to ascend and descend, in order,<br/> therefore,
                    to afford it more easy access to its former tabernacle, a hole<br/> is cut in
                    both the head of the coffin and the covering of the tomb, the<br/> ground not
                    being considered as any obstruction to its entrance or egress.</p>
<p>At these mourning processions, the women, who more generally at-<br/>tend than
                    the men, and have the task of burial assigned them, give<br/> every possible
                    vent to their passions, as also when they return to the<br/> house of the
                    deceased, where they indulge in feasting, and extremity of<br/> grief; and this
                    is renewed by the female relatives, and neighbours meet-<br/>ing at the same
                    house every morning, for nine days, and kept up by<br/> doleful noises and
                    lamentable cries, for about the space of half an hour.<br/> When the days of
                    mourning are thus ended, they meet together, and<br/> are consoled to dry up
                    their tears, from which time they endeavour to<br/> discard all marks of
                    lamentation.</p>
<p>They relate circumstances that happened formerly, of ancient In-<br/>dians, who
                    were disabled from hunting, by infirmity, and becoming tired<br/> of life, would
                    request to be buried alive. A grave or hole was then<br/> dug, in which a seat
                    was formed in digging, the ancient Indian was then<br/> let down, and taking his
                    last seat, the other Indians began to fill in the<br/> earth, doing it very
                    gently and tenderly till it had risen to his chin. A<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_026" n="28"></pb> pause was then made, and some ceremony
                    used, after which the young<br/> warriors threw in the dirt very hastily, so as
                    to prevent their being<br/> witnesses to his struggles, and to terminate his
                    sufferings as speedily as<br/> possible. Happily there exists no such barbarous
                    custom among them<br/> at the present day. They are superstitious in the
                    extreme, with re-<br/> spect to dreams, and witchcraft, and councils are often
                    called, on the<br/> most trifling occurrences of this nature. To elucidate this
                    - in the win-<br/>ter of 1799, while one of the Friends was engaged in
                    instructing the<br/> children in school learning, a message carne from a
                    confederate tribe,<br/> eighty miles distant, stating that one of their little
                    girls had dreamed<br/> that “the devil was in all white people alike, and that
                    they ought not<br/> to receive instruction from the Quakers, neither was it
                    right for their<br/> children to learn to read and write.” In consequence of
                    this circum-<br/>stance, a council was called, the matter was deliberated on,
                    and divers<br/> of them became so much alarmed, as to prevent their children
                    from<br/> attending the school for some time.</p>
<p>They are also in the practice of collecting together and making feasts<br/> in
                    remembrance of their dead, some months after the interment, under<br/> an
                    apprehension that the deceased will receive some benefit thereby.<br/> And if an
                    Indian of any particular tribe dreams a remarkable dream,<br/> respecting a
                    deceased relative being hungry, or in need of sympathy,<br/> or assistance in
                    any way, the Indians of the deceased's particular tribe<br/> are informed of it,
                    and a deputation is sent out to hunt. The game<br/> thus taken, is prepared and
                    cooked, and a feast and dance in a religious<br/> way is instituted, which
                    continues for a day or more, whereby they ap-<br/>prehend the wants of the
                    deceased are satisfied.</p>
<p>Exclusive of these, they have frequent banquets, in which they re-<br/>gale
                    themselves with strong liquors, and pass whole nights in singing,<br/> dancing,
                    and music - performing every whimsical and antic manœuvre<br/> which their wild
                    imaginations can invent, and which in some instances<br/> baffles
                    description.</p>
<p>Their marriages are as singularly conducted as their worship, and<br/> funerals.
                    They generally marry young, the males frequently between<br/> fourteen and
                    eighteen, and the females from twelve to sixteen. The<br/> match is frequently
                    agreed upon by the parents, while the children<br/> are quite young, in which
                    case they are betrothed without consulting<br/> each other's choice, or
                    inclination. When they arrive at maturer age<br/> before the choice is made, and
                    a young man has fixed on the female<br/> he wishes to make his companion, he
                    acquaints his mother or eldest<br/> sister, if he has either living, or
                    otherwise some female relative, of his<br/> intentions, who imparts his desires
                    to the mother or sister, or other fe-<br/>male relative of her with whom he is
                    enamoured, and this proposal they<br/> communicate to the young woman.</p>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_027" n="29"></pb>
<p>It is also common to present her or her father with some kind of<br/> trinkets or
                    merchandise to the value of several dollars. If his proposal<br/> of marriage is
                    not accepted, a negative is put upon it by returning the<br/> present, but if,
                    after some days consideration, it is satisfactory to the<br/> young woman and
                    parties concerned, her mother or sister accompanies<br/> her to the young man's
                    home, and presents her to him. The mother<br/> or sister then withdraws, and she
                    stays with her proposed husband.<br/> They appear apparently shy of each other,
                    and now perhaps their in-<br/>timacy and knowledge of each other's
                    qualifications are only commenc-<br/>ing. No ideas of state and grandeur - no
                    homage of wealth - no pride<br/> of house or furniture are sought for, on these
                    occasions. The man<br/> having signalized himself by feats of hunting, and the
                    woman by her<br/> industry in the culture of corn and vegetables, are the
                    criteria and<br/> summit to which their wishes aspire. As the season for
                    planting, tend-<br/>ing, and gathering corn, procuring firewood, &amp;c. come
                    on, the female<br/> connexions of the young woman assist her in the different
                    operations<br/> during the first year, at the end of which, without any other
                    ceremony,<br/> the nuptial tie is consummated and considered valid and
                    honourable.<br/> They sometimes, however, take a shorter way for it, and too
                    commonly<br/> part again on small disagreements. Although they appear to be
                    natu-<br/>rally lively in their dispositions, and well calculated for social
                    inter-<br/>course, yet the different sexes are very jealous, and apparently shy
                    of<br/> each other, so that it is rare to see a man and woman, even of the
                    same<br/> tribe, conversing together without witnesses. And when a woman
                    has<br/> occasion to go from home, it is accounted honourable to take with
                    her<br/> one or more children to testify, if needful, that she has been
                    orderly.<br/> There are too many proofs, however, that this is only a pretended
                    shy-<br/>ness, yet being sanctioned, and established by custom, it is
                    productive<br/> of serious evils, by putting a negative on an open, friendly
                    acquaint-<br/>ance of the sexes, with each other, the natural tendency whereof
                    would<br/> be, the mutual improvement of their minds, and furnish a
                    knowledge<br/> of each other's qualifications, which in many instances would
                    produce<br/> undesigned and permanent attachments. Whereas they frequently<br/>
                    marry without real affection, without a knowledge of each other's
                    dis-<br/>positions, and before the judgment is ripe for such a choice; the
                    con-<br/>sequence of which is that separations often take place - so that
                    there<br/> are many instances among them, of men who have turned off
                    several<br/> wives, and of women who have discarded as many husbands. These<br/>
                    on both sides marry again (in a clandestine way) to others, and in some<br/>
                    instances change back again, and thus what ought to be esteemed the<br/> most
                    important connexion in life, is lightly formed and dissolved, and<br/> shifted
                    about in a manner unknown among any people rightly civilized.</p>
<p>When such separations take place, the mother generally takes the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_028" n="30"></pb> children, and I believe their property
                    also descends by inheritance, in<br/> the female line of succession.</p>
<p>It is said that, formerly, when an Indian of distinction died, his gun,<br/>
                    blanket, knife, and other property, not buried with him, were preserved<br/>
                    about twelve, and sometimes eighteen months. This delay was occa-<br/>sioned, in
                    consequence of an opinion which they entertained, that it was<br/> not decent or
                    respectful to bring them into use sooner; they were then<br/> sent into council,
                    and held up to public view, the Indians present being<br/> informed that they
                    were the goods of such a deceased chief. On the<br/> articles being thus
                    severally held up, any of the young men who inclined,<br/> were at liberty to
                    advance and snatch them away, till the whole were<br/> thus distributed, the
                    relatives of the deceased making no claim in con-<br/>sequence of connexion.
                    This custom though grown out of use among<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, is said still to prevail among some Indian nations, in
                    the<br/> southern states.</p>
<p>Although they have no regular system of laws by which they are<br/> governed, and
                    every man is master in his own family, yet they are more<br/> or less influenced
                    by certain principles which conduce to their general<br/> benefit. They possess
                    their land in common, and no individual has any<br/> further security for the
                    improvement he makes on the land, than what<br/> custom has established. This,
                    however, is held inviolable, and no in-<br/>stance occurred in the course of my
                    observation, of their encroaching<br/> on each other's property, without consent
                    of parties; and if disputes<br/> at any time happen with respect to the
                    boundaries of the land they<br/> wish to cultivate, the interference of the
                    chiefs settles the difference.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> is composed of eight great
                    families or tribes.<br/> These are designated by the names of Bear, Wolf, Deer,
                    Crane, Snipe,<br/> Beaver, Turtle, and Hawk tribes. Each tribe proposes its own
                    chiefs,<br/> and brings forward all other matters in council that particularly
                    relate<br/> to their own people. The different tribes have each at least one
                    Chief<br/> to represent them in council. The office of chief is not in all cases
                    in-<br/>herited in a lineal succession, but they are promoted by the will of
                    the<br/> people, and appointed by the united content of the chiefs in
                    council.<br/> They have no power further than what their weight of
                    influence<br/> gives them. Activity in hunting, wisdom in council, and exploits
                    in<br/> war, are high traits in their character, to raise them to this
                    station;<br/> and while they continue to hold the good opinion and respect of
                    the<br/> nation, they are advised with, and looked up to, in all matters of
                    diffi-<br/>culty; but when the good opinion ceases, they lose their influence
                    in<br/> council, and are discarded from being actors in public affairs.</p>
<p>Excepting some who have private grants and specific annuities from<br/>
                    government, their chiefs have no pecuniary advantage above other In-<br/>dians,
                    nor in their private capacity are they treated with any dis-<br/>tinguished mark
                    of respect.</p>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_029" n="31"></pb>
<p>The genealogy of each particular tribe is traced, according to their<br/> degrees
                    of consanguinity, by the side of the mother. They do not live<br/> in separate
                    villages, but are settled promiscuously throughout the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Sene-ca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>. There are also a number of inferior chiefs
                    appointed at<br/> each village, who are called upon as counsellors, when
                    occasions re-<br/>quire, and no business of importance is transacted without
                    their privity<br/> and concurrence.</p>
<p>These chiefs are empowered to inculcate good precepts, and encour-<br/>age the
                    youth and warriors to sobriety and good actions. And although<br/> their women
                    are degraded below the rank they maintain in more civil-<br/>ized societies, yet
                    even here they possess considerable influence, in re-<br/>gulating the conduct
                    of the men, in various respects. Some of the more<br/> wise and knowing among
                    them are frequently admitted into their coun-<br/>cils, and give their
                    sentiments publicly on matters of importance.</p>
<p>They are very jealous of encroachments on what they esteem their<br/> rights and
                    privileges; and offences of this nature have often given rise to<br/> war
                    between nations. Such of the captives taken in war as are pre-<br/>served alive,
                    are sometimes adopted into families, in the place of rela-<br/>tives who have
                    been killed in the war. In such cases they are treated<br/> kindly: and several
                    of this description remain among the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>,
                    who<br/> have intermarried with them, and become so habituated to their
                    man-<br/>ners and mode of life, that they show no inclination to leave them.</p>
<p>It is said many of the devoted number of captives were formerly<br/> roasted and
                    eaten. There was living, since Friends settled among the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, one or two Indians residing on the
                        <geogname key="alleg">Alleghany river</geogname>, who had<br/> partaken of
                    this inhuman feasting; but the custom has long since been<br/> exploded by this
                    nation.</p>
<p>Though honesty, in a general way, may be reckoned one of their<br/> signal
                    virtues, yet instances of stealing sometimes occur.</p>
<p>When any discovery is made that would lead to detection of the<br/> person
                    committing a theft, complaint is made to the chiefs, who despatch<br/> a
                    messenger commanding his appearance forthwith before the council;<br/> this
                    mandate he instantly obeys; the charge is then opened to him, and<br/> if he is
                    guilty, and confession is made, the property taken is restored,<br/> if in
                    being. Every Chief or warrior in council is then at liberty to ex-<br/>press
                    what they think, or wish to say, one by one, on the occasion,<br/> which the
                    offender is obliged to hear. This is considered a severe pu-<br/>nishment, but
                    no other is inflicted. Should the person charged deny<br/> that he is guilty, he
                    is considered innocent - for it is remarkable that<br/> they generally confess
                    when justly charged, and also that their eyes<br/> and countenances immediately
                    betray them. There is no corporeal<br/> punishment practised among them, except
                    where the crime is consider-<br/>ed worthy of death.</p>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_030" n="32"></pb>
<p>The Indian names are often significant of something in nature, as<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>'s name in the Seneca language is
                    Ky-on-twa-ky; Connu-<br/>dia signifies a handsome lake, Ogis-quah-tah is dry
                    musk, Oenda<br/> means the first ripe corn, Yeang-qwa-haunt, chew-tobacco,
                    &amp;c. They<br/> are also frequently named from occurrences that happen near
                    the time<br/> of their birth, and their names are occasionally changed in
                    consequence<br/> of remarkable circumstances taking place, or of particular
                    employ-<br/>ments, or acts of individuals.</p>
<p>It is supposed that in a general way the Indians rather exceed white<br/> people
                    in longevity, often living, as they imagine, to the age of ninety<br/> and one
                    hundred years; but as they keep no written records of births<br/> or other
                    occurrences, nor have any regular method of computing time,<br/> other than by
                    moons and winters, or the remembrance of remarkable<br/> events, very few of
                    their elderly people can give a correct account<br/> how old they are. There is
                    now living on the <geogname key="alleg">Alleghany river</geogname> an old<br/>
                    woman, who can call her descendants round her to the sixth generation.</p>
<p>There was also an Indian living at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta1">Cattaraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a>, in the year 1800,<br/> who said he was one hundred
                    and twenty-one years of age. He said<br/> he had been in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> when it was a very small town, and gave<br/> such
                    a circumstantial and regular account of his life, as (together with<br/> his
                    aged brow and furrowed cheeks,) induced me to credit his relation.</p>
<p>The Indians are frequently skilful in the application of simples, as<br/> also in
                    the knowledge of the medicinal qualities of divers herbs and<br/> plants.</p>
<p>They, however, practice bleeding on trivial occasions, and when a<br/> person has
                    been a considerable time sick, in a lingering condition, and<br/> the foregoing
                    applications prove ineffectual to restore him to health, it<br/> is common for
                    the friends of the diseased person to collect, and, dressing<br/> two or more
                    men with masks and other accoutrements, as in times of<br/> public worship, they
                    repair to the habitation of the sick, which they<br/> go round, rattling and
                    rubbing the tortoise shell, and whooping in a<br/> frightful manner.</p>
<p>Although this is a known custom, and in time of health gives no<br/> alarm, yet
                    on the debilitated Indian, whose fears are awakened by<br/> knowing what is to
                    be endured, it has considerable effect. The men<br/> then enter the house,
                    continuing the noise and acting every wild con-<br/>tortion and manœuvre which
                    their imaginations devise. Sometimes<br/> they pull the sick person (male or
                    female,) about the house, dirtying<br/> them with their black hands, rubbing
                    their heads and bodies over with<br/> ashes, and handling the patient in so
                    rough a manner, that a person<br/> unacquainted with their custom, might suppose
                    they were going to kill<br/> him. After this wild treatment, and having
                    thoroughly dirtied the<br/> house with ashes, they withdraw, and leave the nurse
                    to clean after<br/> them.</p>
<pb facs="SW_HJ1830_031" n="33"></pb>
<p>Absurd as this practice appears, in many cases it is said to have had<br/> a
                    beneficial effect, by restoring perspiration, working on the imagina-<br/>tion,
                    and rousing the indisposed person to a salutary exertion.</p>
<p>Their idea is, that they drive away the evil spirit by this procedure.</p>
<p>Their skill in painting and hieroglyphics is somewhat extraordinary.</p>
<p>In their travelling excursions, they frequently describe on the bark<br/> of
                    trees, by certain emblems or characters which they understand, the<br/> time
                    they have been from home, the number of persons in company,<br/> the ensign of
                    the tribe they belong to, the course they are going, and<br/> the number of deer
                    or other animals they have killed.</p>
<p>They are also very ingenious in their idea of the geography of the<br/> country
                    with which they are acquainted, and readily trace on a map<br/> the particular
                    waters they have traversed, pointing out their bearings<br/> and courses.</p>
<p>Their reckoning of time is by moons and winters, and the length of<br/> their
                    journey is computed by the number of days it takes to travel it.</p>
<p>They also divide the day into certain parts, such as morning, noon,<br/> and
                    evening; and in speaking of the time of day, point to the sun's<br/> place in
                    the firmament. In speaking of sun-set, they say, Onah Gagh-<br/>qua, (the sun is
                    gone.)</p>
<p>Their ideas are very confused with regard to astronomy, and they<br/> have mean
                    conceptions of the rotundity of the earth.</p>
<p>They cannot conceive that a person travelling in a direct line could<br/> ever
                    come back to the same place again, or that men can walk on the<br/> opposite
                    side of the globe to them. They, like some of the ancients,<br/> rather favour
                    the idea of the earth being an extended plain, and not<br/> understanding the
                    principles of gravitation and attraction, they believe<br/> that if the world
                    turned round, the water would unquestionably fall<br/> off from it.</p>
<p>Their ancient notion respecting thunder was, and still has considera-<br/>ble
                    place among them, that a being whom they call Eno, sent from the<br/> Great
                    Spirit, and inhabiting the southern mountains, was in the prac-<br/>tice of
                    discharging a short gun which he employed in that way, and<br/> sometimes
                    striking the trees to show his great strength and power.<br/> They supposed him
                    to live on large snakes and wild beasts, and that he<br/> was always a friend to
                    the Indians, though he sometimes killed white<br/> people.</p>
<p>They believe that Eno sends down a stone bolt about one inch in<br/> diameter,
                    and seven or eight in length, with which he splits trees, &amp;c.<br/> and when
                    they are so fortunate as to procure this bolt, they entertain<br/> an opinion
                    that constant success will attend all their undertakings while<br/> they possess
                    it. They also believe that fire taken from a tree burning<br/> by lightning and
                    kindled in their houses, is an antidote against fatal <br/>5 <pb facs="SW_HJ1830_032" n="34"></pb> disorders. This they keep burning for a certain
                    time, and then ex-<br/>tinguish it, and kindle another fire in it, stead. In
                    times of drought,<br/> they frequently go to a tree that has been lately struck
                    with lightning,<br/> and kindle a fire at the root, in the smoke whereof
                    ascending, they of-<br/>fer up a petition to Eno, praying him to send rain; and
                    circumstances<br/> of this ort frequently occur a little previous to rain
                    coming, which<br/> greatly tends to keep up this superstitious idea among them.
                    These<br/> notions, however, are rather declining among the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>.</p>
<p>These Indians, in general, (their young people excepted,) were un-<br/>happily
                    the victims of great intemperance, when they could obtain<br/> strong liquors;
                    and most of the evils that afflict them might be traced<br/> to that source.
                    This article of strong drink was sometimes carried<br/> among them by white
                    traders, who also furnished them with abundance<br/> of silver trinkets, beads,
                    and the like ornaments adapted to their taste.</p>
<p>The Indian themselves were also in the practice of trading to the<br/> frontier
                    settlements of white people, and exchanging their skins, furs,<br/> and other
                    merchandise, for liquor, which they often brought home to<br/> their villages,
                    and sold out by retail. This kept many of them conti-<br/>nually in a state of
                    intoxication, while they could obtain the liquor,<br/> and many scenes of human
                    wretchedness were the fatal consequences<br/> thus produced. Their aged women,
                    in particular, were conspicuous<br/> sufferers by this evil, and were often seen
                    lying beside the paths, over-<br/>come by it.</p>
