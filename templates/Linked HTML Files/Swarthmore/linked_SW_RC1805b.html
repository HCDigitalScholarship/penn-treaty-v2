<p>The Rachel Coope manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed this manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: . Transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present
                    form by Professor Murray. </p>
</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>Journals "a" and "b" represent transcriptions of Rachel Coope’s actual diaries.
                    Journal "a" her “esteemed parents”; however, her mother died before the letter
                    was written, and so it may have been meant for her parents­in­law, to whom she
                    was deeply attached) copied over twice. No version of this letter is included in
                    journal four. Except for this, the differences were small, such as variance in
                    phrasing and spelling, and not in content. It seems as though journal "a"
                    preceded journal "b"; it is less polished. The handwriting seems more rushed and
                    the paper size varies, while in journal "b", the handwriting is neater, and the
                    paper used is consistent. It is possible that these, especially journal three,
                    could have been handwritten by Coope.</p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on the
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<geogname key="alleg">Allegeny River</geogname>, to endeavor to instruct<br/>
                    them in Agriculture, Spinning, Dairy,<br/> &amp;c, and having obtained the Unity

<p>After a time of comfortable quiet<br/> wherein we were favoured to feel the<br/>

                    close trial, tears flowed in an<br/> abundance under a feeling sympathy for<br/>

                    Life, which is the<br/> precious enjoyment of all the sincere<br/> hearted.

                    very muddy,<br/> tho the Country was beautiful, fine grain<br/> and clover,

                    was soon after ob-<br/>structed by a large Ridge of Limestone<br/> Hills, the
                    Rocks in places were 30 or 40 feet<br/> high, the Ridge continued till we came
                    near on <del>the</del><br/> bank of the River. got in sight of <a href="/places/harrisb">Harrisburg<placename key="harrisb"></placename></a><br/> about 1 OClock, 9 miles, we stoped
                    under the<br/> Shade of a Tree, bought grass for the Horses,<br/> and took some

                    full bloom on each<br/> hand made the prospect truly delightful,<br/> but after
                    a calm sometimes comes a storm,<br/> we now crossed <geogname key="fishi">Fishing Creek</geogname> a large<br/> stream, and then for three Miles it
                    was a-<br/>stonishing to behold the romantic appear-<br/>ance, one rough stony

                    to lead us through<br/> a gap in a Mountain, we have had a num-<br/>ber of such

                    to bed, but there was our<br/> greatest mortification, we had not<br/> been long
                    in bed, before the Landlady, sent<br/> two Men who were travelers into<br/> our

                    as usual, we lay very quiet<br/> and rose before day. 30 miles</p>

                    made such heavy moans,<br/> and querying of him what Ailed him<br/> he said that
                    he was about building<br/> and that he had thought so much a<br/>bout it, that

                    Building his House, and<br/> that I saw no sufficient cause for him to<br/> be
                    discouraged, he said he had been<br/> a hardworking Man, and helped<br/> through
                    many difficulties by the<br/> hand of Providence, but all was<br/> as nothing to
                    him now, we told him<br/> that hand that hand which had hi-<br/>therto helped
                    him, would continue<br/> to help if he did but rely upon, and<br/> put his trust
                    in it, he said he had<br/> strove with all his might but he<br/> could not help

                    matter, we found, that as the Waggon<br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_15" n="15"></pb>was going down a Steep, and
                    excessively<br/> Muddy place, a Bed that we had tyed<br/>up in a Blanket, but
                    was not suffi-<br/> ciently secured, Sliped out of the<br/>fore end of the

                    recieved no da-<br/>maged, we took the blanket of the<br/>bed and tyed it up in

                    times the<br/>bridge being gone, I observed a sap-<br/>ling across the streem
                    about 2 yards<br/>from the Water, and on attempting<br/>to go over on sd. tree
                    when I got a-<br/>bout ½ way; the log shaking, my foot<br/>sliped, and in I
                    went, tho the Water<br/>was but shallow yet I had to wade through<br/>tho it was
                    early to stop for Breakfast<br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_16" n="16"></pb>Yet as I had got my feet Wet, we<br/>

                    after going along<br/>both roads a considerable distance, we<br/>were informed

                    banks were so steep and sidling<br/>that it appeared impossible to get
                    along<br/>without upsetting. in a while we cross-<br/>ed another large branch of

                    further we got<br/>stoped by the trees that were across the<br/>Road, we then
                    got help from one Boat-<br/>mans, and it took 5 men near two<br/>hours to open
                    to Road to his House,<br/>so as to get the Waggon along, tho it<br/>was not half
                    a Mile, here it looked<br/>likely we must leave it, tho we en-<br/> deavoured to

                    &amp;<br/> nearly out of Provisation, and no Mill<br/>within 20 miles, the Woman
                    said she could<br/>supply us with Milk and butter, but that<br/>she had nothing
                    else except a little Veneson<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_20" n="20"></pb>which was
                    a very good relish for our<br/>Coffee that we had prepared for our<br/>Dinner,
                    we now got to unloading<br/>our Waggon, and packing up our<br/>goods suitable to
                    be carried on horse-<br/>back, we laped up one Bed in the<br/>Waggon Cover,
                    which Cover served us<br/>for a Tent the two nights we lodged in<br/>the Woods,
                    we sewed up a sheet <del>and</del><br/>and filled it and a Bag with Clooth-<br/>
                    ing &amp;c and after other arangments<br/>the day was so far spend, we

<p>Brothers attend</p>
<p>You know we have<br/> often talked to you about opening a good Road<br/>
                            from this Town to Tunasapah in or<br/>der to make it more easy for
                            your<br/> People to come to Mill. If you will<br/> join together and
                            open this Road, we<br/> have concluded to give you 7000<br/> feet of
                            Boards. This will enable you<br/> to finish your Houses, to have
                            them<br/> warm against next winter.</p>
<p>Brothers, you know we began to<br/> grind for you about the time you<br/>
                            were making sugar last spring, we<br/> will continue to grind for you
                            until<br/> next season for sugar making, with<br/>out taking toll which
                            will make<br/> one year. And if any of you want<br/> boards we will sell
                            them to you<br/> for four shillings but we don’t<br/> intend to trust
                            any, because we want<br/> to keep the Chain of frendship bright,<br/>
                            and if you Want any of your own logs<br/> sawed into boards, or
                            Scantling, if you<br/> will cut and haul the logs to the Mill<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_31" n="31"></pb> we will saw them for one half</p>
<p>Brothers these advantages which<br/> we now proposed unto you, are
                            intend<br/>ed to encourage you to pursue habits<br/> of Industry and
                            Sobriety. We wish you<br/> to keep your Minds strong to pursue this<br/>
                            path, then we think your Substance will<br/> increase, and the great
                            Spirit will<br/> help your Labours.</p>
<p>Brothers we don’t want to tire your<br/> Ears with many words, but it
                            affords us much<br/> Satisfaction to see your Industry this Spring,<br/>
                            in enclosing so many fields to plant corn<br/> &amp;c in, and that you
                            continue your good<br/> resolution against the use of Spirits<br/> and
                            Liquours. We repeat it again, be<br/> strong in your Minds against this
                            great<br/> Enemy, and never let him rise up a<br/>gain. We have all
                            united our Minds<br/> together in this Speech, and shall de<br/>liver
                            you a Copy of it, in order that<br/> your memories may be kept
                            bright.</p>

<p>I have felt satisfaction in being<br/> with the Indians today, and <a href="/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> says he has felt as much peace
                        in<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_32" n="32"></pb> attending some of their
                    Councils, as is<br/> common to experience in attending a<br/> Quarterly Meeting.
                    But it will take us<br/> some time before their Language will be<br/>come
                    familiar and we can get to<br/> understand it. __ About 30 of<br/> the Indians
                    has since joined, and opened<br/> the Road proposed, which will be<br/> an
                    advantage to us as well as to<br/> them, a grand piece of work for<br/> Indians,
                    it being copletley done.</p>
<p><a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> did not attend the<br/> Counsil,
                    but has since been here. I<br/> did not deliver the message to him<br/> for want
                    of an Interpreter, <a href="/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> saying he
                    thought he could<br/> not make him understand which<br/> of the friends that
                    were here was thee.</p>
<p>There was a paragraph in the address<br/> from the Committee, to the Indians,
                    sent<br/> by us, recommending, that when<br/> any of them has done any thing,
                    that a<br/>nother does not like, they should not differ<br/> about it, but
                    forgive him that had<br/> done the wrong, for the good Spirit<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_33" n="33"></pb> forgives us when we do wrong, if we<br/> are
                    sorry for it. I do not know but it<br/> had some good effect, for about two
                    days<br/> after, they called a Council, sent for <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, made up all the uneasiness, &amp;<br/>
                    restored him to his former post, with<br/> the same powers. He has since
                    been<br/> here, and said when any thing happened<br/> to them in future, they
                    had better try to<br/> make it up among themselves, and<br/> not go tell it
                    abroad over the<br/> Country for that made it worse, he<br/> also told us of
                    some other advice he gave<br/> them, which I thought was very suitable.<br/> And
                    he further said that Old friends<br/> down the Country might be informed<br/>
                    that the difference was all done away,<br/> and that there was nothing
                    between<br/> us, meaning the Quakers, and them.</p>
<p>It was very agreeable information to<br/> us, to hear that <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> was restor<br/>ed, for his Judgment in matters of
                    im<br/>portance was of consequence. He wanted<br/> to see some of our linnen, or
                    Manufac<br/>turing, and said if two or more of their<br/> Women could get in the
                    way of making<br/> they could learn the others.<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_34" n="34"></pb></p>
<p>I think best of further describing the<br/> new house we are settled in, and its
                    Si<br/>tuation. It is a pretty Commodious<br/> two story Log house 22 by 36
                    feet, the<br/> Floors and partitions laid rough until<br/> the Floor season, the
                    Lower story is intended<br/> to be finished this summer, and the re<br/>maining
                    Work of the House next<br/> Winter. It is divided into a Parlour,<br/> Kitchen,
                    and two Chambers. One of the<br/> Rooms is occupied by my husband<br/> and I,
                    the other by Cousin, up stairs<br/> one fine place, 4 rooms intended ,where<br/>
                    the Men sleep. The small hosue where<br/> the Young Men lived before the
                    move<br/> into this is occupied by a white fa<br/>mily who has undertaken to
                    clear<br/> 20 Acres of Land this Summer, and<br/> are now engaged in it. When
                    that is<br/> done, the House finished, and some other<br/> improvements made, it
                    will be a<br/> handsome place. With the mills about<br/> 30 Veareh from the
                    house, South West corner<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805b_Page_35" n="35"></pb> the Mill
