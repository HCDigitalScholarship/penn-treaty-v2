<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of these minutes, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The authors of the original book of minutes do include page numbers on this
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been rendered as written, even in some cases
                    when they are not sequential.</p>

<p>A weighty concern being opened in this<br/>Meeting respecting the difficulties
                    and distress to which<br/>the Indian Natives of this land are subject—it
                    obtained the<br/>serious attention of Friends, and many observations ware
                    made<br/>on the kindness of their ancestors to ours in the early<br/>settlement
                    of this Country—exciting to a deep consideration<br/>and enquiry whether, under
                    the influence of that exalted<br/>benevolence and good will to men which our
                    holy Prof-<br/>ession requires; any thing, remained for us as a Society<br/>to
                    do, to promote their Welfare, Religious Instruction,<br/>Knowledge of
                    Agriculture and useful Mechanic Arts,<br/>a solemnity and uniting Calm
                    prevailing over the Meeting<br/>the further consideration of it is refered till
                    tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Subject of the distressed Indian natives being<br/>again revived, the
                    sentiments of many Brethren expressed,<br/>and a prevailing Sympathy felt, it
                    appears to be the<br/>united sense of this Meeting that it be recommended
                    to<br/>our quarterly and Monthly Meetings to take this<br/>concern into serious
                    consideration and open subscriptions<br/>among our Members for their relief. The
                    encouragement<br/>of School Education Husbandry and the Mechanic<pb facs="BYM_Page_002" n="2"></pb><br/>Arts amongst that people, and it appears their<br/>situation demands
                    immediate attention we hope a<br/>spirit of liberality will be manifested and
                    those<br/>who find freedom to subscribe are desired to put
                    their<br/>contributions into the hands of the following Friends<br/>who are now
                    appointed to receive and apply the<br/>same in such manner as will best answer
                    the<br/>benevolent intention carefully guarding against<br/>giving offence to
                    government org.<br/>

                            some<br/>information of their progress and movements in<br/>the business
                            intrusted to their care.</p>
<p>The committee at large concluded to address our<br/>quarterly and Monthly
                            Meetings thereon and to<br/>circulate the same in all the particular
                            Meetin-<br/>gs together with the minutes on our Yearly Meeting<br/>and
                            extracts from divers Speeches and Letters of<br/>Indian Chiefs all
                            tending to spread useful information<br/>and draw the attention of our
                            Members to the situ-<br/>ation of these distressed people, which we hope
                            will<br/>have a beneficial effect by exciting in the minds<br/>of
                            Individuals a feeling sympathy with them<br/>and an increasing desire to
                            be helpful in promoting<br/>their civil and religious improvement,
                            several<br/>Sober religious minded persons having already <pb facs="BYM_Page_005" n="5"></pb><br/>signified a willingness to devote their time <del>and</del>
                            to<br/>go and reside amongst them for that purpose</p>
<p>We have also written a circular letter to the<br/>different tribes of
                            those called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>
                            opening<br/>before them the desire we have to assist them in
                            attaining<br/>a more comfortable, quiet and peaceful mode of
                            life<br/>than they have been accustomed to desiring they would<br/>in
                            their councils solidly weigh and concider our proposal<br/>and send us
                            their result as early as may be.</p>
<p>Some of us have wa-<br/>ited on the President of the United States and
                            acqua-<br/>inted him with the views of our religious Society in<br/>the
                            exercise of endeavours for the instruction of the<br/>Indians in the
                            cultivation of their Lands and in other<br/>respects tending to their
                            comfort and improvement<br/> in a more civilized state which he assured
                            us<br/>ware objects he had endeavoured to promote and<br/>ware fully
                            approved by him.</p>
<p>The secretary of state who has the Mangement<br/>of all concerns with the
                            Indians, under his particu-<br/>lar care has also been conferred with
                            and manifests a<br/>desire to cooperate with our society in promoting
                            the<br/>welfare of the Indians which will appear or perusing<br/>a copy
                            of his letter to the six nations herewith sent,</p>
<p>And we may further inform you that <persname key="ichap1">Israel<pb facs="BYM_Page_006" n="6"></pb><br/>Chapin</persname>, Superindendant of Indian Affairs
                            who<br/>resides at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/conan">Conadarque<placename key="conan"></placename></a> in
                            their country and<br/>we have reason to believe has great influence<br/>
                            among them, being lately in this City, we<br/> have fully and freely
                            confered with him on<br/>the present concern and had the satisfaction
                            to<br/>find him thoroughly disposed to render his best<br/>Services
                            therein, in which we believe he may<br/>be singularly useful.</p>
<p>The distresses and difficulties<br/>which these poor people labour under
                            we believe<br/>may in a great degree be attributed to their
                            pro-<br/>pensity to the use of Spirituous Liquors introduced<br/>among
                            them by Traders and Evil-minded men<br/>who have been in the practice of
                            taking advan-<br/>tage of this weekness and cheating them of
                            their<br/>Skins and Furs, which instead of being applied to<br/>the
                            purchase of Cloathing and necessary articles<br/>are too generally
                            bartered for Rum and Whiskey<br/>and thus through their attachment to
                            this de-<br/>basing and destructive Enjine of Satan, they are
                            left<br/>destitute and miserable, their morals corrupted and<br/>as they
                            come to reflect with coolness their minds are<pb facs="BYM_Page_007" n="7"></pb><br/>embittered
                            against the white people. The Committee<br/>have used some endeavours to
                            excite in the minds of our<br/>Rulers a due sense of this envimity
                            desiring they would<br/>devise means for restraining or prohibiting the
                            iniquitous<br/>Traffic. The plea offered by some attempted on the part
                            of<br/>the United States it would avail but little in remedy-<br/>ing
                            the evil while the British Traders from Canada<br/><gap></gap> deal so
                            largely with the Indians in this article.<br/>We nevertheless hope that
                            a representation to the<br/>British Government &amp; this shewing the
                            gross iniquity<br/>of this reproachful trade, may have a Tendency at
                            least<br/>to check it inpart, if not fully.</p>
<p>As in our attention to this concern any thing<br/>shall arrise that may
                            be deemed useful &amp; proper<br/>to communicate we mean to impart the

<p>On consideration of the Expences likely to attend<br/>the visit to the Indians we
                    think it right that<br/>the treasurer should advance such sum as they<br/>think
                    necessary they to be accountable for the same</p>
<p>Then adjourned to meet again at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>

                    of the river ohio<br/>have so far attended to the trust reposed in us as
                    to<br/>meet at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bees">Beesan Town<placename key="bees"></placename></a> at which place we

                    found that he had proceeded down<br/>the river to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/cinci">Cincinnata<placename key="cinci"></placename></a>. We then proceded to the<br/>Mouth of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wheel">Wheeling<placename key="wheel"></placename></a> where we were informed by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ezane1">EbenezarZane<persname key="ezane1"></persname></a> that a number of Chiefs and
                    Hunters had lately<br/>been about the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/muskr">Muskingum
                        river<placename key="muskr"></placename></a> &amp; thought it likely<br/>we could accomplish our
                    business to satisfaction with<br/>them. We accordingly proceded to those parts
                    but they<br/>were gone, particularly the chiefs, some to one place<br/>and some
                    to another so that it appeared impracticable<br/>for us to have them collected
                    in a suitable manner for<br/>a conference. We are however of the mind that
                    if<br/>notice of the intention of Friends was communicated<br/>to them, and they
                    desired to fix on time and place, of<br/>which Friends might have notice, would
                    be the most<br/>likely way to obtain a satisfactory conferrence

<p>The committee last year, appointed to attend<br/>to the Concern opened
                            and considered in the yearly Meeting<br/>relating to the civilization
                            and improvement of the<br/>situation of the Indians have divers times
                            met and<br/>conferred on the Method most proper to persue in
                            order<br/>To obtain the necessary information respecting
                            the<br/>situation and disposition of those nations who<br/>reside most
                            convenient on the NW of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohior">river
                                Ohio<placename key="ohior"></placename></a><br/>and believed the way most likely to answer
                            that<br/>purpose would be to appoint some of our number<br/>to go into
                            that Country and open biefor their chiefs<br/>the desire friends had of
                            affording them som assis-<br/>tance in the particulars above mentioned,
                            according<br/>by 5 Wise nominated for that pupose 4 of whom
                            after<br/>being furnished with permission from Government<br/>proceeded
                            to the mouth of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wheel">Wheeling<placename key="wheel"></placename></a> on the

                            were there informed by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ezane1">Ebenezer Zane<persname key="ezane1"></persname></a> a
                            well<br/>disposed man of good account in that place that a<br/>number of
                            chiefs and hunters had lately been about the<br/>forks of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/muskr">Muskinghum river<placename key="muskr"></placename></a> and that he thought
                            it<br/>likely they could accomplish their business with<br/>them to
                            satisfaction they accordingly proceed agreeably<br/>to this information
                            but found the chiefs dispersed in<br/>different directions and that it
                            was not practicable<br/>to get them convened in a suitable manner for
                            a<br/>general conference—but were of opinion that if notice<br/>of the
                            intention of friends was intimated to the<br/>Indians in a suitable
                            manner and they requested<br/>to fix a time and place of meeting a
                            satisfactory<br/>conference might be obtained as the disposition
                            of<br/>such of them as they had opportunity of conversing<br/>with
                            appeared favourable<br/>The intention of friends being now a little
                            known<br/>amongst the Indians unavoidably also amongst some<br/>other
                            people and the funds to carry any thing of this<br/>kind being yet too
                            small, the business we think will<br/>require attention oftener than
                            would be convenient<br/>for the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/bym">Yearly
                                Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>, and are of opinion that<br/>if the care of it was
                            transfered to the meeting for<br/>sufferings it would be useful and that
                            some addition<br/>to our number in this weighty undertaking

<floatingtext type="report">

<p>In the course of an attention to our appointment we<br/>proceded as far

                            their agent had lately gone<br/>home to Bethleham and before his
                            departure had<br/>procured a supply of provisions for the winter for
                            those<br/>Indians, that they ware dispursed in hunting camps<br/>and few
                            of them at their Town, we did not think it<br/>necessary, we proceded in
                            that direction, but <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tsmit1">Thomas Smith<persname key="tsmit1"></persname></a><pb facs="BYM_Page_029" n="29"></pb><br/>a friend who lives near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/geort">Georgetown<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, having informed<br/>us that 8 or 10
                            families of other Indians dispersed<br/>in hunting parties on the
                            braches of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tuscr">Tuscrawas<placename key="tuscr"></placename></a><br/>were very
                            desirous of being instructed in farming<br/>and were in want of a
                            temporary supply of<br/>Provisions, we believed it wright to turn
                            our<br/>attention to them, and having sent for some of their<br/>active
                            men to meet us, we were at last prevented<br/>from an interview by the
                            ice running in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohior">Ohio<placename key="ohior"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>After leaving a supply for their relief when they<br/>could get over the
                            river we returned to redstone and<br/>engaged with a smith to make a few
                            farming utensils</p>
<p>We have not received any answer on the<br/>subject communicated to their
                            chiefs last year, and<br/>have reason to believe it is accasioned by the
                            alarm<br/>spread among them last spring, which probably<br/>prevented
                            its being laid before their general council<br/>which is held at that
                            season of the year at the <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">lower Sandusky

                            would tend to increase among the<br/>western Indians a confidence in us

                            other for as our<br/>respective appointments direct the promotion<br/>of

                            to us for some friends to settle amongst<pb facs="BYM_Page_031" n="31"></pb><br/>them and a
                            speech we have lately received from<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> leaves scarce a doubt but a like<br/>request
                            will be made from that nation—hitherto<br/>we have proceeded no further
                            than to furnish the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Mia-mies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> with
                            two plows a Harrow, gears, and sundry<br/>useful articles nor is there a

                            enquired of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshef1">JonathanShefflin<persname key="jshef1"></persname></a> if
                            he knew on what their expectation of<br/>a visit was founded as we had
                            given them none<br/>he informed us it was an answer to a few
                            lines<br/>which were signed by two or three friends and left<br/>at
                            their Village as when they were there the<br/>Indians were generally out
                            a hunting—We suppose<br/>it must have been those friends of your
                            Committee<br/>who were in that Country as from us none have<br/>as yet
                            been amongst the Nations West of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohior">RiverOhio<placename key="ohior"></placename></a>. If you have any answer to make

                            convenient<br/>we are aware that Indians very generally take

                            consideration as probable to take place if<br/>they unite with it, we

                            as<br/>the more we become acquainted with the Indian<br/>Character the

                            called Quakers</opener>
<p>Brethren Quakers<br/>You remember that we once<br/>met at a certain
                            place; when we had met at that certa-<br/>in place a great many good
                            things were said, and<br/>much friendship was professed between us,
                            Brethren—<br/>you told us at that time when we met together:
                            That<br/>you not only took us by the hand, but that you<br/>held us fast
                            by the arm, That you then formed a<pb facs="BYM_Page_033" n="33"></pb><br/>Chain of Friendship:
                            you said it was not a<br/>Chain of Iron, but that is was a chain
                            of<br/>precious Metal, a chain of silver, which would<br/>bind us in
                            brotherly affection forever,</p>
<p>Brethren; you then said, That this Chain<br/>of Friendship would bind us
                            together so fast<br/>that we should never part. It is our
                            sincere<br/>wish that the Chain of Friendship so made<br/>should never
                            be Broken, nay not by the efforts<br/>of the evil Spirit himself.</p>
<p>Brethren; These are only a few words that<br/>I recollect of a great many
                            that were said at<br/>that time and place. We have no records or
                            place<br/>of security for our Speeches as you have—Nor<br/>can we write
                            as you do—Our Belts of Wampum<br/>are our only records, But if you
                            examine your<br/>old Books and papers you will there find
                            written<br/>all that passed between your Forefathers and ours</p>
<p>Brethren listen<br/>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandat Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>
                            your<br/>Brethren, are happy to hear that you have not<br/>forgot what
                            our Grandfathers agreed on at that time</p>
<p>We have often heard—That you were a good and<br/>Faithful People, ever
                            ready to do Justis and good to all<pb facs="BYM_Page_034" n="34"></pb><br/>Men whether they were
                            white or black—Therefore we<br/>love you the more sincerely, because of
                            the goodness<br/>of your hearts, what has been talked of amongst
                            our<br/>nations long since,</p>
<p>Brethren, My brethren the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>
                            are<br/>happy to be informed, that some of you express<br/>a wish to pay
                            us a visit, When you do come forward<br/>for that purpose we will then
                            show you, a <gap></gap><br/>of Wampum which was given to us by
                            your<br/>forfathers, with a piece of written parchmen
                            affixed<br/>thereto when you see the belt of wampum and have<br/>read
                            the writing on the parchment you no doubt will<br/>then perfectly know
                            us and will concider us brethren<br/>united by a chain of friendship
                            which never be broken<br/>whilst Memory lasts.</p>
<p>Brethren listen—As I have mentioned before<br/>so let us procede. We are
                            much pleased to hear<br/>that you still hold in remembrance our
                            nephews<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware nation<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, The

<opener>To the Yearly Meeting now sitting</opener>
<p>The Meeting was last year informed that a<br/>sub committee was appointed
                            to visit some<br/>Indians on the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/muskr">Muskinghum<placename key="muskr"></placename></a> with liberty if they<br/>should believe it
                            necessary to afford them some<br/>assistance, who last spring reported
                            that they had<br/>made some provission for 8 or 10 families on
                                the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tuscr">Turkerawars<placename key="tuscr"></placename></a> branch of
                            that river who appeared in<br/>a situation of distress, they also
                            provided several<br/>kinds of farming utensils which are not
                            yet<br/>delivered to the Indians</p>
<p>Soon after this report was received a Speech<br/>from the principal Chief
                            of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> was<br/>received by the

                            the Indians<br/>five Friends were appointed to attend their

                            produced<pb facs="BYM_Page_040" n="40"></pb><br/>the following Report</p>
<p>Pursuant to our appointment we set out<br/>on a visit to the Indians the
                                <date when="1799-05">7th of the 5 Mo last</date><br/>and after
                            passing through two of their towns arrived<br/>on the 3rd of the most
                            month at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">upper Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a><br/>the
                            principal village of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandotts<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>
                            where we<br/>met with a friendly reception from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhic<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> the<br/>head Chief and others of that Nation</p>
<p>Upon confering with them we found a mis-<br/>take had been made in the
                            translation of the<br/>speech which they sent to friends, respecting
                            the<br/>time of opening their great Council which they<br/>now informed
                            us began annually at the full<br/>moon in this month and finding it
                            would be<br/>difficult to procure subsistance for ourselves &amp;
                            horses<br/>here until that time We concluded it would<br/>under our
                            present circumstances, be best to<br/>propose to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhic<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> a conference with him &amp;<br/>the other Chiefs
                            who were then at San Dusky<br/>which was accordingly agreed to, and at
                            the time<br/>appointed we met him and two other chiefs at<br/>his own
                            house, when we had a full opportunity<br/>with them on the subject of
                            our visit</p>
<p>Our communication appeard to be rec.<br/>with great satisfaction by them
                            and in their<br/>answer deliverd to us on some strings of Wampum<pb facs="BYM_Page_041" n="41"></pb><br/>which we were desired to take with us to Friends
                            they<br/>expressed the gratitude they felt for the care
                            and<br/>friendship their beloved brethren the Quakers had
                            always<br/>manifested for the Indians &amp; informed us that as<br/>soon
                            as the grand Council met they would communi-<br/>cate to it the concern
                            which our society now felt<br/>for their improvement and inform us by a
                            written<br/>speech of their conclusion thereon</p>
<p>While we were at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San Dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> and
                            other<br/>Indian Villages our minds were often deeply<br/>affected under
                            the sorrowful consideration of<br/>the baneful effects of spiritous
                            Liquors on them<br/>they being supplied with it in almost every
                            village<br/>by Cannadian Traders residing amongs them and<br/>we are
                            confirmed in the opinion from furnishing<br/>them with this distructive
                            article in exchange<br/>for their skins &amp; furs they will not easily
                            be<br/>persuaded to turn their minds towards agriculture<br/>and the
                            useful arts. At the same time we have<br/>no doubt but these
                            unprincipaled men will make<br/>use of the great influence they have
                            over the Indians<br/>to keep them in their present way of living as
                            most<br/>conducive to their own interest, notwithstanding<br/>which
                            present discouragement, they great affection<br/>they have fore our
                            society manifested on all occasions<pb facs="BYM_Page_042" n="42"></pb><br/>while we were
                            amongst them, induces us to<br/>wish friends may endeavour to keep under
                            the<br/>weight of the concern and be prepared to proceed<br/>in this
                            benevolent word whenever the way may<br/>open for further service

<p>Brothers<br/>You sent us a speech &amp; Belt of Wampum<br/>from your
                            great council held last fall was 2 years<br/>at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. In that speech you told us that then<br/>was a
                            Chain of friendship formed between your<br/>forefathers and ours, that
                            you were then told it<br/>was a chain of precious metal, a chain
                            of<br/>silver that would never grow rusty and that it<br/>would bind us
                            in brotherly affection forever</p>
<p>Brothers We were glad to hear, that you still<br/>keep in remembrance
                            this agreement between your<br/>grand fathers &amp; ours when they first
                            met on your<br/>land on this great Island—ever since that time
                            we<br/>have held fast our end of this chain of friendship</p>
<p>Brothers In that speech you told us, that if any<br/>amongst us were sent
                            to visit you in your<br/>tents the next summer that they would be
                            likely<br/>to go by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San Dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> and
                            that you would then<pb facs="BYM_Page_044" n="44"></pb><br/>take them not only by the hand but
                            by the arm<br/>and conduct them safe to the grand Council<br/>fire of
                            your great Sasteretsy where every thing<br/>good is transacted &amp;
                            nothing bad is permited to<br/>appear</p>
<p>Brothers We accordingly sent out some of<br/>our friends about 2 years
                            ago, these went as far<br/>as upper <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San
                                Dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>—you received them like brethren<br/>but they found
                            that they had got there too soon<br/>for your great council and having
                            little pro-<br/>vissions for themselves &amp; horses and not being
                            accus-<br/>tomed to live in the woods, they were discouraged<br/>from
                            proceeding any further and proposed to hold<br/>a talk with some of your
                            chiefs then present<br/>these chiefs agreed to it and when they met
                            our<br/>friends made a speech to them and they ret.<br/>an answer on 4
                            things of Wampum, but the<br/>young man that talked between them, could
                            not<br/>speak plain and our friends were sorry they could<br/>not fully
                            understand what was said at that time<br/>and expect that your Chiefs
                            did not understand<br/>what our friends said for they told us you
                            intended<br/>to send us soon the conclusion of your great</p>
<p>council respecting our business with you &amp;<br/>we have had no account
                            from you since</p>
<p>Brothers They were also discouraged on account<pb facs="BYM_Page_045" n="45"></pb><br/>of the
                            abundant use of Spiritous Liquors amongst<br/>your people apprehending
                            it did them much injury &amp;<br/>if continued you might prevent our
                            being capable of<br/>rendering you much service</p>
<p>Brothers We are listening to hear what you have<br/>to say to us and have
                            sent you this speech appre-<br/>hending you have not understood what has
                            been hereto-<br/>fore communicated to you and lest you have
                            not<br/>understood it we again ask you if you are willing<br/>to have
                            your children instructed at home on your<br/>own lands how to raise
                            plenty of corn, make<br/>cloathes &amp; build houses, to keep your old
                            men, your<br/>women &amp; Children warm when the weather is cold<br/>and
                            that you may not suffer for want when game<br/>gets scarce in your

<p>Proceedings of the first Conference.<br/>A member of the society of
                            Friends open-<br/>ed the conference by addressing the<br/>chiefs as
                            follows:</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I AM desirous that in the early part<br/>of
                            this opportunity, you may be inform-<br/>ed, that the people called
                            Quakers con-<br/>sider all mankind as their brethren; that<br/>they
                            believe the Great Spirit and Father<br/>of Mankind created all men of
                            one blood;<br/>and that it is the will of Him who also<br/>created the
                            Sun, the Moon and the Stars,<br/>and causes them to give us
                            light—that<br/>Great Spirit and common Father of all<br/>Mankind—that we
                            should not do one<br/>another hurt, but that we should do
                            one<br/>another all the good we can; and it is<br/>on this ground and
                            this principle that<br/>we believe it tight to take you by
                            the<br/>hand.</p>
<p>After sitting a short time in silence,<br/>another Friend addressed them
                            as fol-<br/>lows:--</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We the people called Quakers believe<br/>that
                            it is required of us, that we should<br/>all love one another, however
                            separated<br/>we may be in our local settlements in the<br/>world, or
                            whatever difference there may<br/>be in our color: And as we are
                            convinc-<br/>ed it is not in our power to perform our<br/>religious
                            duties to Him that hath created<br/>us, without his assistance, so we
                            conceive<br/>it to be our duty, when we are about to<br/>enter upon such
                            weighty business as I ap-<br/>prehend this is, thus to sit down in
                            stillness,<br/>in order to endeavor to feel after the operation<br/>of
                            his spirit in our hearts, and we believe<br/>that this cannot be
                            attained by our own<br/>natural powers, but must be under the
                            in-<br/>fluence of the Good Spirit. We also be-<br/>lieve that there is
                            an evil spirit, which is al-<br/>ways striving to lead us into wrong
                            things:<br/>that Spirit which leads us to hate and de-<br/>story one
                            another: and in this persuasion<br/>of mind, we believe it necessary for
                            us<br/>to sit down in stillness and quiet, to<br/>wait upon the Great
                            Spirit. Under these<br/>impressions we are concerned often to
                            as-<br/>semble ourselves together, that we may<br/>individually come
                            under an exercise and<br/>concern, to be rightly directed inour
                            re-<br/>ogious movements; and once in the year<br/>we assemble at
                            certain places, in order to<br/>have a general and full conference,
                            to<br/>know how things are amongst us as a<br/>people. One of these
                            meetings is held<br/>at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>
                            and another at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>.<br/>At our
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/bym">yearly meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> at Baltimore
                            se-<br/>veral years past, our minds were brought<br/>under a concern on
                            behalf of our bre-<br/>thren the Indians; and remembering
                            the<br/>friendship that had subsisted between our<br/>society and the
                            Indians, from the first<br/>settlement of our fathers upon this
                            con-<br/>tinent, and at the same time recollecting<br/>that the country
                            to the westward was<br/>fast settling, apprehensions arose in
                            our<br/>mind, that as the game became scarce,<br/>they would be brought
                            under sufferings,<br/>and as there had been long wars between<br/>some
                            of the white people and the Indi-<br/>ans, we had not had, for a long
                            time,<br/>an opportunity of taking our brothers,<br/>the Indians, by the
                            hand. Now, bro-<br/>thers, as we were thus led by the con-<br/>cern that
                            arose in our council, some of<br/>us were appointed to go out into
                            the<br/>wilderness, and endeavor to get amongst<br/>our brethren the
                            Indians, that we might<br/>have some talk with them; and
                            amongst<br/>those who were appointed, this my bro-<br/>ther, who sits at
                            my right hand, was<br/>one: and I have thought that he per-<br/>haps can
                            give a more full account both<br/>of the time, and of our first
                            movements<br/>at the concern.</p>
<p>The Friend alluded to then proceed-<br/>ed:--</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>About six years ago, we believe the<br/>Good Spirit put
                            into our hearts, at our<br/>great council held in this town, to
                            endea-<br/>vor to do something for the Indians; and<br/>about four years
                            ago, two others, besides<br/>myself, went over the Great
                            Mountains<br/>westward, in order to see your situation,<br/>and to know
                            your disposition, whether you<br/>would receive any thing from us or
                            not.<br/>We wished to go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>,
                            expecting<br/>to find the greatest number of Indians at<br/>that place.
                            We could not get a guide till<br/>we got to the forks of Scioto, where
                            we<br/>agreed with one to take us to <persname key="izane1"></persname>Isaac
                            Zane’s.<br/>--At that place we were informed that<br/>a number of chiefs
                            were at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>.—<br/>We sent for
                            some <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> chiefs who re-<br/>sided
                            about 25 miles from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/izane1">Isaac
                            Zane’s<persname key="izane1"></persname></a>,<br/>and had a conference with them. We in-<br/>formed
                            them of the desire our society had<br/>to do something for the Indians
                            that would<br/>be useful to them. From thence we went<br/>to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Upper Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>—<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/izane1">Isaac
                                Zane<persname key="izane1"></persname></a> piloted<br/>us, and there also had a conference
                            with<br/>some of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware chiefs<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>.
                            We want-<br/>ed to know whether they would be wil-<br/>ling to be
                            instructed on their own lands<br/>in a way to procure a sufficiency for
                            them<br/>to eat; to have a mill to grind their corn’<br/>and have their
                            children instructed to read<br/>and write. They informed us that
                            they<br/>could not give us an answer at that time,<br/>but would lay our
                            proposals before their<br/>council.</p>
<p>About three years ago we received a<br/>speech and a belt of Wampum from
                            a<br/>council held at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>; the
                            speech did<br/>not contain an answer to the proposals<br/>made to them,
                            but an invitation to us to<br/>attend their council.—[A short
                            pause:]<br/>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle,<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> chief
                            of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>,<br/>said,</p>
<p>“Brother,<br/>It is not usual for us to interrupt any<br/>One in
                            speaking, but I wish to enquire<br/>from whom the speech you mention
                            came."<br/>The speech was then produced, and the<br/>names to it read.
                                –-<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle,<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> adds,</p>
<p>I see that our brothers, the Quakers,<br/>are not so fully acquainted
                            with the situ-<br/>ation of the Indians as we wish. After<br/>we have
                            taken the great chief of the<br/>white people by the hand, I hope he
                            will<br/>give you full information with respect to<br/>us.<br/>The

<p>Two years, last spring, seven of us went<br/>over the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohior">Ohio<placename key="ohior"></placename></a>, and thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Upper San-dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, at the time mentioned in the
                            speech<br/>that was sent to us—We were invited to<br/>be there about the
                            first of June, and ac-<br/>cordingly got there about that
                            time—but<br/>were informed that the council was not to<br/>be held till
                            about two weeks after. Not<br/>being accustomed to their mode of
                            living,<br/>and finding a considerable number of the<br/>Indians at that
                            place intoxicated with li-<br/>quor, we were much discouraged,
                            and<br/>concluded we might as well return home<br/>again. The Indians
                            however, notwith-<br/>standing their situation, treated us
                            very<br/>kindly. –We got together several chiefs of<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and communicated to them<br/>our
                            business—They informed us they<br/>would lay it before the chiefs at the
                            coun-<br/>cil and return us an answer; but we have<br/>not yet received
                            one.</p>
<p>The friend who made the second commu-<br/>nication, addressed them again
                            as fol-<br/>lows:</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We were glad when we heard that sone<br/>of our
                            red brethren were come to this city,<br/>and felt our minds drawn to
                            take them by<br/>the hand, in order that we might have
                            an<br/>opportunity of knowing them. As we<br/>had not been acquainted
                            with their situa-<br/>tions and circumstances, we have not<br/>been able
                            to judge whether any thing we<br/>had to propose to do for them would
                            be<br/>accepted? –Whether they were under the<br/>necessity of applying
                            to some other mode<br/>for a livelihood? –Whether the game in<br/>their
                            country was in plenty? We have<br/>thought, brothers, that if it should
                            not yet<br/>be the case that the game is scarce, it pro-<br/>bably will
                            be the case at some time; and<br/>therefore we thought it would be best
                            for<br/>our red brethren to gibe some attention to<br/> the cultivation
                            of the soil. This is one of the<br/>subjects which has claimed our
                            considerati-<br/>on. And feeling in our hearts that we loved<br/>the
                            Indians, and wished their welfare, it was<br/>our concern that they
                            might be instructed<br/>to turn their attention to the
                            cultivation<br/>of their lands. And as we believe, broth-<br/>ers, that
                            we derive very great advantages<br/>from reading books which contain
                            much<br/>instruction, &amp; wishing that our brethren, the<br/>Indians,
                            should also derive the same advan-<br/>tages with us, we have wished
                            that they<br/>should candidly let us know, whether they<br/>desire these
                            things, that we might do for<br/>them whatever is in my power to do.</p>
<p>After a pause, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt"></persname></a>
                            observed,<br/>“Brothers and Friends,<br/>If there is any thing more that
                            you have’=<br/>to say we wish to hear it; but if not I will<br/>make a
                            short reply to what we have already<br/>heard you say." He was desired
                            to pro-<br/>ceed; when rising on his feet he said—</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>My heart returns thanks to the Great<br/>Spirit
                            above, that has put it in our power<br/>to speak to each other. My
                            brother<br/>chiefs, with myself, are glad that our<br/>friends and
                            brothers the Quakers, have<br/>such great compassion for their red
                            bre-<br/>thren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>Your red brethren believe, that one
                            man<br/>--one Great Man—made all the men that<br/>are on the earth; and
                            that he made men<br/>when he made the earth, and that he made<br/>the
                            sun, the moon and the stars to give<br/>light and to be useful to
                            them.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>We now rejoice that the Great Spirit
                            has<br/>made you feel that we stand in need of<br/>the assistance which
                            you have been describe-<br/>ing to us, and to wish if possible to
                            render<br/>your red brethren those services which<br/>they now are
                            highly in need of.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>It appears to us, your red brethren,
                            that<br/>you have been kept in the straight path by<br/>the Great and
                            Good Spirit. We have been<br/>led astray by inferior spirits: we now
                            hope<br/>that we may come upon your track and<br/>follow it.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>The long and destructive wars that<br/>have
                            raged in the country of your red<br/>brethren, since your fathers first
                            camea-<br/>mongst them, have caused their numbers<br/>to be greatly
                            diminished. Those that have<br/>come amongst us have very much
                            cheated<br/>and imposed upon us. They have found us<br/>simple and
                            ignorant, and have taken very<br/>great care to keep every thing from
                            our<br/>knowledge in order to profit by our ignor-<br/>ance.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>We find that you are now disposed with<br/>open
                            arms to receive us, and we hope the<br/>Great Spirit will assist you,
                            together with the<br/>great chief of the white people, whom we<br/>are
                            now about to apply to for help.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>At the treaty of Grenville, which is now<br/>a
                            little past six years ago, we received some<br/>presents by the hands of
                            the great war chief<br/>of the Americans—<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gwayn1">(gen.
                                Wayne)<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> said<br/>to be sent to us by our brothers the
                            Qua-<br/>kers. After this treaty, I was invited by<br/>the great chiefs
                            of the Americans to<br/>visit them. It is now four years since<br/>I
                            visited them at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, whilst
                            the<br/>great council was held at that city. I had<br/>there opportunity
                            to see our brothers the<br/>Quakers, and received from their
                            mouths<br/>some talks: all these talks I wrapped up<br/>in my heart, and
                            when I returned home<br/>to my brothers, I communicated to
                            them<br/>faithfully all those good things which you<br/>had told us you
                            were desirous to do for us.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>I am happy to say that these my
                            red<br/>brothers now present with me are chiefs,<br/>who, in their own
                            country are equally great<br/>with myself. They were rejoiced to
                            hear<br/>your words delivered to them through me,<br/>four years ago,
                            and they are now equally<br/>glad with myself, to hear from the
                            mouths<br/>of our brothers, the Quakers, the same<br/>good words
                            again.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>If we understand you right, you wish to<br/>add
                            comfort to our women and children by<br/>teaching us some of your ways
                            of living. I<br/>am glad that the Great Spirit has put this<br/>into
                            your hearts, and am sorry that your<br/>exertions have not yet been
                            successful.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I now assure you, that you hear the<br/>voice
                            of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Pattawattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">De-laware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,

                            tribes<br/>of Indians, and that if you wish to do any<br/>thing for any
                            of these nations of Indians,<br/>they will be ready at all times to
                            receive<br/>you—and we also will be ready at all times<br/>to render you
                            any assistance in our power.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>This is the first time that the Great
                            Spi-<br/>rit has brought us to take our brothers,<br/>the Quakers of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, by the hand,<br/>and
                            we rejoice to hear them mention the<br/>same things to us, that have
                            heretofore<br/>been mentioned to us by our brothers, the<br/>Quakers of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. Brothers, I
                            some<br/>time past received from our brothers, the<br/>Quakers of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, some tools
                            amongst<br/>which were two ploughs. I used them, &amp; did<br/>all I
                            could to keep them from wearing out<br/>--I was pleased with them: They
                            have<br/>now become necessary to be repaired. We<br/>have nobody amongst
                            us that can mend<br/>them and they are now useless to me.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>It is now five days since we took
                            our<br/>brothers, the Quakers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> by<br/>the hand—we then talked over these
                            things<br/>together. They have promised me that at<br/>their next great
                            council, they will hold a<br/>talk about these things, and consider
                            what<br/>they can do for us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>If our brothers, the Quakers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Balti-more<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, desire to do any thing for
                            the In-<br/>dians, I wish to give them full information<br/>of the place
                            where we may be found gene-<br/>rally together. The great council of
                            our<br/>tribes of Indians, is held at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a><br/>at the time we receive our annuity from<pb facs="BYM_Page_049" n="49"></pb><br/>the United States. At that time any
                            com-<br/>munications our Brothers wish to make to<br/>their red
                            brethren, will be safely handed to<br/>us by your white brother, our
                            interpreter<br/>now with us, who is our agent at that<br/>place.</p>
<p>He then sits down—after a short pause<br/>rises again,</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>I must add a few words further: I find<br/>that I have not
                            fully answered all the<br/>questions that our brothers have put to
                            us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>It is the real wish of your brothers
                            the<br/>Indians, to engage in the cultivation of our<br/>lands—And
                            although the game is not yet<br/>so scarce, but that we can get enough
                            to<br/>eat, we know it is becoming scarce, and<br/>that we must begin to
                            take hold of such<br/>tools as we see are in the hands of the<br/>white
                            people.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We are now on our way to see the
                            great<br/>chiefs of the Americans at their council.<br/>We are glad to
                            find that they remember<br/>their red brethren, and rejoice to
                            believe<br/>that the Great Spirit has put it into the<br/>heart of the
                            great chief of the white peo-<br/>ple to do us such services as will add
                            to the<br/>comfort of his red children.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I will now only add, that I rejoice
                            to<br/>believe that your friendship to your red<br/>brethren is a
                            friendship that is pure—a<br/>friendship that comes from the
                            heart—You<br/>want no compensation from the Indians<br/>for your
                            services to them. You do not<br/>want to take away our lands from
                            us—<br/>you have always made use of this language<br/>to us; and it has
                            always been with plea-<br/>sure that I have communicated it to
                            our<br/>brethren. Brothers, we are a jealously<br/>disposed
                            people—almost every white man<br/>that comes amongst us, endeavors all
                            he<br/>can to cheat us; this has occasioned jeal-<br/>ousy among us. But
                            your talks, brothers,<br/>are different; we believe you, when
                            you<br/>say you want no compensation from us,<br/>for your services to
                            your red brethren.</p>
<p>Sits down.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five Medals,<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> chief of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Pattawattamies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>,<br/>rises:</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>I rejoice to hear that you have so
                            much<br/>compassion on your red brethren. As my<br/>friend the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> has observed, it is<br/>not
                            the first time that we have received to-<br/>kens of friendship from
                            you. It is some<br/>years since the treaty of Grenville, where<br/>we
                            first experienced the friendship of our<br/>brothers, the Quakers. Some
                            time after<br/>the treaty, my friend the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/>visited the great council of the white
                            peo-<br/>ple held at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>; he
                            there saw our<br/>friends and brothers, the Quakers—He<br/>was there
                            informed of their good wishes,<br/>and of the great friendship they had
                            for<br/>their red brethren. He returned home<br/>and informed of all the
                            great talks he had<br/>with our brothers, the Quakers, of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Phila-delphia.<placename key="phila"></placename></a></p>
<p>It is truly pleasing to me, Brothers, to<br/>hear the same talks my
                            friend had inform-<br/>ed me of, now repeated on my arrival
                                at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> by our friends
                            and brothers the<br/>Quakers.</p>
<p>I hope, Brothers, that the Great Spi-<br/>Rit, who has the disposal of
                            men will assist<br/>you in your laudable undertakings, and<br/>enable
                            you to be of service to your red<br/>Brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>The talks that you have now delivered<br/>to us
                            shall be carefully collected, wrapped<br/>up, and put in our hearts—we
                            will not for-<br/>get them. On our return home we will<br/>have them
                            communicated from the head to<br/>the mouth of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabasu">Wabasu<placename key="wabasu"></placename></a>—from this to<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/missi">Missisippi<placename key="missi"></placename></a>, and up that river until
                            it<br/>strikes the Lakes, thence round by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/michi">Michil-limackanack<placename key="michi"></placename></a> until they come back
                            again<br/>to the same place. What we say to you,<br/>you may be assured
                            does not come from one<br/>man—it comes from many—and what you<br/>have
                            said to us, you speak it to but a<br/>few, but it shall be communicated
                            to many.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I observed to our friends the Quakers<br/>of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, five days ago, what
                            I<br/>now say to you—That we wish our bro-<br/>thers, the Quakers, to
                            render us those<br/>services which they have proposed. We<br/>promise
                            that nothing shall be wanting on<br/>our part to give aid to so
                            desirable a<br/>thing in our country. Our situation at<br/>present will
                            not admit of carrying such<br/>a plan so fully into execution as
                            might<br/>be desired by our brothers; but that, I<br/>hope, will not
                            prevent you from making<br/>trial. If we had such tools as you
                            make<br/>use of and which add so much to your<br/>comfort—for we have
                            been lost in wonder<br/>at what we have seen amongst you—if<br/>we had
                            these instruments, we should, I<br/>hope, be willing to use them; and in
                            the<br/>course of a little time, there would be<br/>people amongst us
                            that would know well<br/>how to use them, through the
                            assistance<br/>they might obtain from you and the rest<br/>of our white
                            friends.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>Whatever goods you may have in store<br/>for
                            your red brothers, we cannot but wish<br/>that you will shew them to us
                            as soon<br/>as possible. That we can yet live upon<br/>the game of our
                            country, is true; but<br/>we know that this will not be the
                            case<br/>long. Brothers, from the great things and<br/>the astonishing
                            wonders which we have<br/>seen among you, and finding that they<br/>all
                            come out of the earth, it makes me anx-<br/>ious to try if I cannot get
                            some for my-<br/>self. I hope, brothers, that by the aid<br/>of the
                            Great Spirit, and of our friends<br/>and brothers, the Quakers, together
                            with<br/>the government of the United States, that<br/>we shall yet be
                            enabled to get these good<br/>things for ourselves—such as will
                            make<br/>us, our women, and our children happy.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We do not know what our brothers, the<br/>Quakers of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, may have in
                            con-<br/>templation to do for their red brethren, but<br/>we hope it
                            will be something that will add<br/>to our comfort; we hope it will be
                            some-<br/>thing by which we shall profit; something<br/>by which we
                            shall be enabled to cultivate<br/>our lands, and live by the fruits of
                            the<br/>earth. We have been walking in a thorny<br/>path; we want to get
                            into your track and<br/>follow it; and the sooner this is put
                            into<br/>our power, I am convinced the better it<br/>will be for our red
                            brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I have not much to say further; what<br/>has
                            now been said to you is the voice<br/>of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Pattawattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>,

                            tribes<br/>of Indians. I rejoice, brothers, that we<br/>now know each
                            other, and hope if you have<br/>any thing to communicate to your
                            red<br/>brethren, that it will come to us through<br/>your brother,
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, our
                            inter-<br/>preter, who resides in our country. We<br/>can place great
                            confidence in him: He<br/>if the only white man in our country
                            we<br/>will trust; we shall then get it, and do<br/>now assure you, that
                            is shall be faithfully<br/>sent to all these people, in the
                            manner<br/>you wish it to be.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>I hope the Great Spirit will assist you<br/>in
                            your undertakings to do your red<br/>brethren good. Your movements
                            towards<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> have not met
                            with that<br/>success which they have deserved. It<br/>makes me sorry to
                            find an answer form<br/>them of the kind you have mentioned.<br/>There
                            is a great deal, brothers, in hav-<br/>ing a good interpreter, and
                            beginning at the<br/>right end of the business.</p>

<p>Proceedings of a committee appointed by the<br/>yearly meeting of the
                            respectable society of<br/>Friends, with the Indian
                            chiefs—conclud-<br/>ed from yesterday’s Gazette.</p>
<p>SECOND CONFERENCE.</p>
<p>One of the society of Friends opened the<br/>conference as follows:</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>WHEN the talk which we had last<br/>evening at
                            this place ended, I believe it<br/>was generally understood that the
                            subject-<br/>matter which had been spoken to was sa-<br/>tisfactory; but
                            on considering further,<br/>some of us though that there were
                            some<br/>things of considerable importance, which<br/>had not been
                            spoken upon—and thought<br/>that it would be right to have another
                            op-<br/>portunity. We are accordingly again<br/>assembled—and seeing
                            that it has been<br/>the will of the Great Spirit and Father of <br/>us
                            all, to permit us thus to come together<br/>again, it is my desire that
                            any thing we<br/>may feel in our hearts that may be likely to<br/>have a
                            tendency to promote the good of<br/>our red brethren, may be freely
                            spoken.</p>
<p>Another Friend next addressed them as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>I may tell you, I have been made glad,<br/>that
                            I have an opportunity of sitting once<br/>more with you; and as I have
                            found that<br/>the more I am with you, the more the<br/>love I have felt
                            for you has increased, and<br/>the stronger has been my desire for
                            your<br/>welfare, and that this love has taken away<br/>all fear of
                            giving offence; I feel myself<br/>authorized, I think, as a brother, to
                            use<br/>freedom of speech with you, and in the<br/>freedom which I feel,
                            under the influence<br/>of that love which I trust has been
                            impress-<br/>ed upon my heart by the great and good<br/>Spirit, who as
                            he has made us all of one<br/>blood so he requires of us that we
                            should<br/> ove one another. I may tell you brothers,<br/>that, when I
                            was in the Indian country,<br/>I had frequent opportunities of
                            observing<br/>the pernicious consequences of the use of<br/>spirituous
                            liquors, with which the Indians<br/>were furnished by the traders, and
                            as I<br/>have reason to believe, that you who are<br/>now present are
                            wise men, men who have<br/>eyes in your heads, and are able to
                            see<br/>things as they really are, I have felt a de-<br/>sire in my
                            heart to know your opinions,<br/>and what is your judgment
                            concerning<br/>this thing—the using spiritous liquors<br/>to excess.
                            Believing brothers, that if<br/>you have seen things in the same light
                            in<br/>which I have seen them, that you would<br/>be desirous that a
                            stop might be put to the<br/>evils that arise from the use of so
                            destruct-<br/>tive a liquor, I may tell you, brothers,<br/>who are now
                            present, as well as the In-<br/>dians in general, that I have believed
                            there<br/>is not any thing that stands more in your<br/>way to
                            improvement than this; the too<br/>frequent use of spiritous liquors:
                            and I<br/>have thought that if you are of the same<br/>mind with us who
                            are your Friends, and<br/>have your good at heart, that it would
                            be<br/>right for us to take the subject into our<br/>serious
                            consideration, to endeavor to dis-<br/>cover, whether there may not be
                            some steps<br/>taken, that would put a check upon this<br/>pernicious
                            thing.</p>
<p>Now, brothers, as a hint of this sort was<br/>omitted when we were
                            together last even-<br/>ing, some of us did not find our minds
                            easy:<br/>we thought it ought to have come under<br/>consideration,
                            hoping that you who, as I<br/>have already said, have eyes in your
                            heads,<br/>and can see for yourselves, have had this<br/>subject under
                            your consideration. We now<br/>hope brothers that you will express
                            your-<br/>selves freely to us on this subject, and let<br/>us know how
                            it has appeared to you.<br/>After which, way perhaps will open
                            for<br/>some further observations from us.</p>
<p>After a short pause the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>
                            on<br/>his seat expresses, I will now make some<br/>reply, if none of my
                            brothers have further to say.</p>
<p>He was desired to proceed—when rising on<br/>his feet he said,</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I am happy to find that it has
                            pleased<br/>the Great Spirit, that we should again this<br/>evening meet
                            in the same house in which<br/>we held our council yesterday. I am
                            hap-<br/>py to find that it is the will of the Great<br/>and Good
                            Spirit, that we should discover,<br/>there was something yesterday not
                            menti-<br/>oned, that was highly necessary for the<br/>welfare of your
                            red brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>I am glad to find that it has pleased
                            the<br/>Great Spirit to put a wish in your hearts<br/>to know our
                            opinions on the subject you<br/>have mentioned; a subject of the
                            greatest<br/>moment to us. What you have said re-<br/>lative to our
                            being one flesh and one blood<br/>is true. Your brothers the Indians
                            believe<br/>that it is in this light the Great Spirit con-<br/>siders
                            all mankind.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>My brother chiefs that are now
                            present,<br/>with myself, are happy to find, that you<br/>have a good
                            opinion of us. You say, that<br/>you apprehend we have eyes in our
                            heads,<br/>and can clearly see for ourselves those<br/>things that are
                            injurious to us; this, my<br/>friends and brothers, is the case; we
                            clear-<br/>ly see these things: my brother chiefs that<br/>are now
                            present with me, as well as myself,<br/>have long seen them; we have
                            long lament-<br/>ed these great evils that have raged in
                            our<br/>country, and that have done your red<br/>brethren so much harm;
                            we have applied<br/>for redress, and endeavored to have them<br/>removed
                            from amongst us.</p>
<p>When our forefathers met first on this<br/>Island, your red brethren then
                            were numer-<br/>ous; but since the introduction amongst<br/>us of what
                            you call spirituous liquors, and<br/>what we think may justly be called
                            poison,<br/>our numbers are greatly diminished: It<br/>has destroyed a
                            great part of our red bre-<br/>thren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I am glad to hear you observe, that
                            free-<br/>dom of speech ought always to be made<br/>use of amongst
                            brothers; this, brothers,<br/>really ought to be the case. I will
                            now,<br/>therefore, take the liberty to mention, that<br/>most of the
                            exciting evils amongst your red<br/>brethren, have been caught from the
                            white<br/>people; not only that liquor that destroys<br/>us daily, but
                            many diseases that our fore-<br/>fathers were ignorant of before they
                            say<br/>you.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I am glad, with my brother chiefs,
                            that<br/>are now present, to find that you are rea-<br/>dy to assist us
                            in every thing that will add<br/>to our good: we hope that the
                            Great<br/>Spirit will aid you in all your good under-<br/>takings with
                            respect to us. We plainly<br/>perceive, brothers, that you see that
                            very<br/>evil that destroys your red brethren. It<br/>is not an evil,
                            brothers, of our own making;<br/>we have not placed it amongst us by the
                            white<br/>people; we look up to them to remove it<br/>out of our
                            country: If they have that<br/>friendship for us which they tell us
                            they<br/>have, they certainly will not let it conti-<br/>nue amongst us
                            any longer. Our repeat-<br/>ed entreaties to those who bring this
                            evil<br/>amongst us, we find, has not the desired<br/>effect. We tell
                            them—Brothers, fetch us<br/>useful things; bring goods that will
                            clothe<br/>us, our women and our children, and not<br/>this evil liquor
                            that destroys our reason—<br/>that destroys our health—that
                            destroys<br/>our lives: But all we can say on the sub-<br/>ject is of no
                            service, nor gives relief to<br/>your red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I am glad that you have seen into
                            this<br/>business as we do—I rejoice to find that<br/>you agree in
                            opinion with us, and express<br/>an anxiety to be, if possible, of
                            service to<br/>us, to remove this great evil out of our<br/>country—an
                            evil that has had so much<br/>room in it—that has destroyed so
                            many<br/>of our lives that it causes our young men<br/>to say, <said>We
                                had better be at war with<br/>the white people: this liquor that
                                they in-<br/>troduce into our country is more to be<br/>feared than
                                the gun and the tomahawk:<br/>there are more of us dead since the
                                treaty<pb facs="BYM_Page_055" n="55"></pb><br/>Grenville, than we lost by the
                                six<br/>years war before; it is all owning to the in-<br/>troduction
                                of this liquor amongst us.</said>—<br/>Brothers, how to remove this
                            evil from our<br/>country we do not know; if we had known<br/>that it
                            would have been a proper subject to<br/>have mentioned to you in our
                            council yes-<br/>terday, we should surely have done it.<br/>This
                            subject, brothers, composes a part of<br/>what we intend to make known
                            to the great<br/>council of our white brethren. On our<br/>arrival
                            there, we shall endeavor to explain<br/>to our great father, the
                            president, a great<br/>many evils that have arisen in our
                            country<br/>from the introduction of this liquor by the<br/>white
                            traders.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>In addition to what I have before
                            ob-<br/>served of this great evil in the country of<br/>your red
                            brethren, I will say further, that<br/>it has made us poor. It is this
                            liquor that<br/>causes our young men to go without<br/>clothes, our
                            women and children to go<br/>without any thing to eat; and sorry am
                            I<br/>to mention now to you, brothers, that the<br/>evil is increasing
                            every day, as the white<br/>settlers come nearer to us, and bring
                            those<br/>kettles they boil that stuff in they call whis-<br/>key, of
                            which our young men are so ex-<br/>tremely fond. Brothers, when our
                            young<br/>men have been out hunting, and are return-<br/>ing home loaded
                            with skins and furs, on<br/>their way if it happens that they
                            come<br/>along where some of this whiskey is depo-<br/>sited, the white
                            man who sells it tells them<br/>to take a little drink; some of them
                            will<br/>say, No, I do not want it—they go on till<br/>they come to
                            another house, where they<br/>find more of the same kind of drink; it
                            is<br/>there again offered, they refuse, and again<br/>the third time,
                            but finally the fourth or<br/>fifth time one accepts of it and takes
                            a<br/>drink, and getting one he wants another,<br/>and then a third and
                            a fourth till his senses<br/>have left him. After his reason
                            comes<br/>back again to him, he asks for his peltry:<br/>The answer is,
                            you have drank them.<br/>Where is my gun? It is gone. Where is
                            my<br/>shirt? You have sold it for whiskey!! Now,<br/>brothers, figure
                            to yourselves what a con-<br/>dition this man must be in; he has a
                            fami-<br/>ly at home, a wife and children that stand<br/>in need of the
                            profits of his hunting: what<br/>must their wants be when he himself is
                            even<br/>without a shirt?</p>
<p>This, Brothers, I can assure you, is a<br/>fact that often happens among
                            us; as I<br/>have before observed, we have no means<br/>to prevent it.
                            If you, Brothers, have it<br/>in your power to render us any
                            assistance,<br/>we hope the Great Spirit will aid you—<br/>we shall lay
                            these evils before our great<br/>and good father; we hope he will
                            remove<br/>them from amongst us; we shall assure<br/>him that if he does
                            not, there will not be<br/>many of his red children living long in
                            our<br/>country. The Great Spirit, Brothers, has<br/>made you see as we
                            see; we hope, Bro-<br/>thers, and expect, that if you have any
                            in-<br/>fluence with the great council of the Unit-<br/>ed States, that
                            you will make use of it in<br/>behalf of your red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>The talks that you delivered to us
                            when<br/>we were in council yesterday, were cerain-<br/>ly highly
                            pleasing to myself as well as to<br/>my brother chiefs; we rejoiced to
                            hear<br/>you speak such words to us; but we all<br/>plainly saw that
                            there was a great difficulty<br/>in the way that ought to be removed
                            be-<br/>fore your good intentions towards us could<br/>be carried into
                            effect: we agree with you,<br/>Brothers, that this great evil amongst
                            us,<br/>spirituous liquors, must first be removed;<br/>after this is
                            done, we hope you will find<br/>an easy access to us, much earlier than
                            you<br/>can have at present.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I hope that if we all try to prevent
                            the<br/>introduction of spiritous liquors in the<br/>country of your red
                            brethren, that the<br/>Great Spirit will aid us in it, and that
                            we<br/>shall meet with no difficulty in doing it;<br/>after this is
                            done, we hope that the great<br/>services you have designed to do for
                            us, the<br/>great things mentioned by you in our<br/>council yesterday,
                            may take place and<br/>have that success you so much desire.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>You have asked us our opinion on
                            the<br/>subject of the introduction of spiritous li-<br/>quors into our
                            country. I have now given<br/>it to you. If I have given it to you in
                            such<br/>a manner that you do not understand me,<br/>I would wish to be
                            make known to<br/>every body. We have our enemies in our<br/>own country
                            as all other persons have in<br/>theirs; it is no unusual thing,
                            Brothers,<br/>to hear some people amongst us, (you<br/>will perceive,
                            Brothers, that these are<br/>people that are interested in keeping
                            us<br/>ignorant,) when they hear talks that have<br/>been delivered by
                            our chiefs to people that<br/>are capable of rendering us services,
                            they<br/>say to our people, <said>do you not hear?<br/>your chiefs have
                                sold you—your chiefs<br/>have sold your lands.</said> They put
                            bad<br/>stories in the mouths of our young men:<br/>for this reason,
                            Brothers, all that I have<br/>said I wish to be made public; I
                            wish<br/>every body to know it. I only mention<br/>this to you,
                            Brothers; if it is improper,<br/>I have no objection to your keeping
                            it<br/>amongst yourselves, but if it could be<br/>made public I would
                            wish it—I have nothing<br/>further to say. Sits down.</p>

                            feet.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I have nothing to say on the subject,<br/>we
                            have now been talking over. My friend<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> has given you a full an-<br/>swer to those
                            things you have mentioned to<br/>us; we are but one people and have
                            but<br/>one voice.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We have never had it in our power to<br/>hold
                            such talks with you at this place be-<br/>fore. We have frequently had
                            talks of<br/>this kind with our brothers, the Quakers<br/>of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>; they always appeared<br/>very
                            glad to see us, and we find you the<br/>same. We hope brothers, that
                            your<br/>friendship and ours will never be broken.<br/>Sits down.</p>
<p>The friend who delivered the second<br/>communication, then again
                            addressed them<br/>as follows:</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers,<br/>What you have communicated to us at<br/>this
                            time, has been clearly understood—<br/>and we are glad to find that you
                            see things<br/>in the same light that we see them. The<br/>several
                            matters you have mentioned, and<br/>the difficulties you have stated,
                            claim our<br/>sympathy and solid consideration, and we<br/>shall, I
                            trust, take the subject up, and if<br/>way should open for us to move
                            forward,<br/>in aiding you in your application to the<br/>general
                            government, we shall be willing,<br/>either on this occasion, or any
                            other, to<br/>render every service in our power.</p>
<p>To the Congress of the United States.</p>
<p>The memoral of the committee appointed<br/>for Indian affairs by the
                            yearly meeting<br/>of Friends, held in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>,<br/>Respectfully represents—</p>
<p>THAT a concern to introduce among<br/>some of the Indian tribes
                            north-west of the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohior">river Ohio<placename key="ohior"></placename></a>, the
                            most simple and useful arts<br/>of civil life, being several years since
                            laid<br/>before our yearly meeting, a committee<br/>was appointed by
                            that body to visit them,<br/>to examine their situation, and
                            endeavor<br/>to ascertain in what manner so desirable a<br/>purpose
                            could be both effected—A part of<br/>that committee after having
                            obtained the<br/>approbation of the president of the United<br/>States,
                            proceeded to perform the service<br/>assigned them, and the result of
                            their<br/>enquiries and observations, as reported to<br/>the yearly
                            meeting, was, that the quantity<br/>of spirituous liquors with which
                            those<br/>people are supplied by traders and frontier<br/>settlers, must
                            counteract the effect of every<br/>measure, however wise of salutary,
                            which<br/>can be devised to improve their situation.</p>
<p>The truth of this being abundantly<br/>confirmed by a speech recently
                            made before<br/>us by the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> chief,
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>,<br/>which we
                            herewith offer to your considera-<br/>tion, and believe the evil to be
                            of such<br/>magnitude, that unless it can be altogether<br/>removed, or
                            greatly restrained, no ration-<br/>al hope of success in the proposed
                            under-<br/>taking can be entertained, we are induced<br/>to solicit the
                            attention of the national le-<br/>gislature to this interesting and
                            important<br/>subject, a subject which we believe involves<br/>not only
                            their future welfare, but even<br/>their very existence as a
                            people.<br/>Signed on behalf of the committee by<br/><list>

                            contemplation<br/>to adjust. The first conference was on the subject of

<p><said who="lturt1">Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>It is the real wish
                                        of your<br/>brothers the Indians to engage in the culture of
                                        our<br/>lands, and although the Game is not yet so
                                        scarse<br/>but that we can get enough to eat. We know<br/>it
                                        is becoming scarce and that we must begin to take<br/>hold
                                        of such tools as we see are in the hands of the<br/>white
                                        people.</said></p>

<p>The second conference was on the subject of the intro-<br/>duction and
                            excessive use of Spirituous liquors among<br/>the Indians. To this the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">little turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> made a

<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date type="unattested" when="1802"></date></dateline>
<said who="lturt1"><p>My Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>I am glad that
                                        you have<br/>seen into this business as we do. I rejoice to
                                        find that you<br/>agree in opinion with us and express an
                                        anxiety to be if possible<br/>of service to us to remove
                                        this great evil our of our country,</p>
<p>An evil that has had so much room in it. That
                                        has<br/>destroyed so many of our lives. That it causes our
                                        young<br/>men to say, We had better be at war with the white
                                        people,<br/>this liquor that they introduce into our country
                                        is more<br/>to be feared than the Gun and the Tomahawk<pb facs="BYM_Page_059" n="59"></pb><br/>there are more of us dead since the treaty
                                        of Genville<br/>than we last by the six years war before. It
                                        is all<br/>owing to the Introduction of this liquor amongst
                                        us</p></said>
</floatingtext>
<p>And on a weighty consideration of this subject<br/>the Committee believed
                            it right to address the following<br/>Memorial to Congress
                                org.<br/><note resp="author">For which see Page 55</note><br/>which
                            was favourably received and a law passed au-<br/>thorizing the President
                            to take such measures from time<br/>to time as to him may seem expedient
                            to prevent or<br/>restrain the vending of distributing Spiritous
                            Liquors<br/>among all or any of the said Indian Tribes</p>
<p>On the subject of civilization the law states<br/>that in order to
                            promote civilization amongst the<br/>friendly Indian Tribes and to
                            secure the continuance<br/>of their friendship it shall be lawful for
                            the<br/>President of the United States to cause them to be<br/>furnished
                            with useful domestic Annimals and<br/>implements of husbandry and with
                            Goods or Money<br/>as he shall judge proper and to appoint
                            such<br/>persons from time to time as temporary agents to<br/>reside
                            amongst the Indians as he shall think fit<br/>provided that the whole
                            amount of such presents<br/>and allowance to such agents shall not
                            exceed $15000<br/>Per annum</p>
<p>Some of the committee have also had an<br/>opportunity with the Secretary
                            of war, who now has the<pb facs="BYM_Page_060" n="60"></pb><br/>direction &amp; management of
                            Indian Affairs, &amp; informed<br/>them that Government had agreeable to
                            the request<br/>of the Indians established a trading House at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">fortWayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, that they were in want of

                            such<br/>as Blacksmiths Carpenters &amp; Superintendants, that
                            they<br/>wanted a Carpenter &amp; Blacksmith such as can<br/>make and

<p>The Meeting was last year informed<br/>that the Western Indians in the

                            desirous of engaging in the<br/>cultivation of their lands, that they
                            had requested<br/>the assistance of Friends and that the
                            President<br/>of the United States was authorised to prohibit
                            the<br/>introduction of spiritous liquors amongst them. This<br/>being
                            the situation of the business, some of the committee<br/>were impressed
                            with a belief that it was necessary that<br/>something should be done in
                            it and accordingly<br/>proceeded last spring for the use of these
                            Indians 6<br/>setts of Plough Irons and their apprentenances,
                            such<br/>as levers &amp;c 10 leather collars, 10 Pair of harnis, 10

                            Indians reply to our letter &amp; forward it to<br/>us. This we have not

<p>The agent also informs that <said who="wwell1">since there has<br/>been
                                no spiritous liquors in the Indian Country<br/>they appear very
                                industrious and are fond of raising<br/>stock.</said> He also gives
                            it as his opinion <said who="wwell1">that<br/>the suppression of
                                spiritous liquors in that Country is<br/>the best thing that ever
                                has been done for the Indians<br/>by the United States, that there
                                has not been one<br/>Indian killed in that neighbourhood this year
                                &amp;<br/>that there never has been a year before, since
                                the<br/>Treaty of Grenville in which there were less than
                                10<br/>killed and some years as many as 30</said></p>
<p>The agent further adds <said who="wwell1">that the Indians<br/>appear
                                very desirous of procuring for themselves<br/>the necessarys of life
                                in our way, but say they<br/>do not know how to begin—some of their
                            old<pb facs="BYM_Page_064" n="64"></pb><br/>men say to him, the white people want
                                for<br/>nothing we wish them to show us how to pro-<br/>cure the
                                many good things we see amongst<br/>them if it is their wish to
                                instruct us Indians in<br/>their way of living as they tell us it is
                                we<br/>wish them to make haste and do it for we are<br/>old and must
                                die soon, but we wish to see<br/>our women and children in that Path
                                which<br/>will lead them to happyness before we die</said></p>

<p>Brothers &amp; Friends of our Hearts!<pb facs="BYM_Page_067" n="67"></pb><br/>We have received
                            your speech from our<br/>friend <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>,
                            with the implements of Husbandry that<br/>you were so kind as to send us
                            to his care, all in good<br/>order</p>
<p>Brothers!<br/>It is our wish that the great spirit<br/>will enable you to
                            render your Red brethren that <gap></gap><br/>service which you appear to be
                            so desirous of doing them<br/>and their women and children are so much
                            in need of.</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We will try to use the Articles you have<br/>sent us and if
                            we should want more we will let<br/>you know it</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We are sorry to say that the minds of<br/>our People are not
                            so much inclined towards the<br/>cultivation of the Earth as we could
                            wish them</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Our Father the President of the United States<br/>has
                            prevented our Traders from selling liquor to our<br/>People which is the
                            best thing he could do for his red children</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Our people appear dissatisfied because the<br/>Traders do
                            not bring them Liquor as usual and we<br/>believe they will request our
                            father to let the Traders<br/>bring them Liquor and if he does your red
                            children<br/>are all lost forever</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>You will see from what we have said<br/>that our prospects
                            are bad at present, though we hope<br/>the Great Spirit will change the
                            minds of our people<br/>and tell them that it would be better for them
                            to<pb facs="BYM_Page_068" n="68"></pb><br/>cultivate the Earth than to drink whiskey</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We hope the great Spirit will permit some<br/>of you to come
                            and see us, when you will be able to<br/>know whether you can do any
                            thing for us or not</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We delivered you the sentiments of our<br/>hearts when we
                            spoke to you at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, and
                            shall<br/>say nothing more to you at present. We now take<br/>each of
                            you by the hand, and all the rest of our brothers<br/>by the hand and
                            thank you for the articles you were<br/>so kind as to send us</p>

                            for the purpose of<br/>instructing them in agriculture taking with him
                            two<br/>good horses to be employed in ploughing &amp;c,. On

                            arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a><br/>Situated on

<p>Shortly after our arrival we convened a few<br/>Indians, amongst whom
                            were the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and<br/>the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> (by whom we were
                            received with<pb facs="BYM_Page_072" n="72"></pb><br/>much apparent affection and friendship)
                            and ac-<br/>quianted them through the interpreter <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a><br/>with the contents of the letter from
                            the committee<br/>directed to them and others. After which we
                            expressed<br/>to them a desire to see their chiefs and young
                            men<br/>more generally, having as we believed some things of<br/>great
                            importance, to their welfare to communicate<br/>and knowing that it was
                            the season of the year in<br/>which most of the Indians were engaged in
                            their<br/>hunting and Sugar Camps, we requested them to<br/>convene as
                            many of their chiefs and principal young<br/>men as could with
                            convenience be collected in the<br/>course of a few days. They expressed
                            a desire that<br/>we would not be in haste to return, but would
                            remain<br/>some time in their country, observing, that it was<br/>their
                            desire we should see their people generally, &amp;<br/>that the season
                            of the year was near at hand, for<br/>them to return to their Towns when
                            they could readily<br/>convene the most of them, adding, that they
                            could<br/>now collect a considerable number of their indolent<br/>ones,
                            who were too lazy to hunt or make sugar, but<br/>such they did not wish
                            us to see</p>
<p>We informed them that we had with us<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip
                                Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> who was willing to remain with them<br/>during the
                            season for the purpose of assisting them in<br/>raising a crop of corn,
                            and shewing them how to<br/>do other things, that the time for him to
                            commence his<pb facs="BYM_Page_073" n="73"></pb><br/>operations being near at hand, required
                            that we<br/>should make haste. They replied that our reasons
                            for<br/>wishing them to meet early were very good and that<br/>they
                            would meet us on the <date when="1804-04-11">11 of the 4
                            Month</date></p>
<p>At that time we were met by several of their<br/>chiefs a considerable
                            number of their principal young<br/>men as also several of their
                            women—when they informed<br/>us that they were ready to hear any
                            communications<br/>from us and as they had previously requested,
                            that<br/>what we had to say might be put upon Paper, that<br/>they might
                            communicate our words, to the Indians<br/>when generally assembled we
                            delivered to them, through<br/>the Interpreter the following address</p>

<p>We know that most of our<br/>red brethren are at present at their
                                    hunting Camps &amp;<br/>at their Sugar Camps and did not expect
                                    to see ma-<br/>ny of them upon so short a notice, therefore as
                                    you re-<br/>quested it we have put upon paper the things we
                                    had<br/>to say and hope you will not fail to have our
                                    words<br/>communicated when at some future time you may
                                    be<br/>more generally assembled</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>When we were together eight days ago<pb facs="BYM_Page_074" n="74"></pb><br/>with the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>
                                    and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>
                                    the<br/>letter was read to them, which has just now been
                                    read<br/>that letter you observe, says that we were
                                    appointed<br/>by our friends and brothers the people called
                                    Quakers at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> to
                                    come and visit you and to take you by<br/>the hand on their
                                    behalf desiring that you wold<br/>receive any communications
                                    from us, as coming<br/>immediately from them</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>After that letter was read our hearts
                                    were<br/>filled with so much love for our red brethren
                                    that<br/>on looking over and considering the business
                                    upon<br/>which we had come, we felt a desire to see as
                                    many<br/>of you together as could be convened and this
                                    day<br/>was then agreed upon for us to meet you</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We believed that the things which<br/>we had to say
                                    were of great importance to the<br/>welfare of our red brethren,
                                    and therefore it was that we<br/>requested to see you together,
                                    that you all might<br/>have an opportunity of hearing what we
                                    have to say</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Our hearts are filled with thankfulness<br/>to the
                                    great Spirit, that he has brought us safely to<br/>the Country
                                    of our red brethren, and protected us<br/>through our journey,
                                    we also rejoice that he has<br/> given us this opportunity of
                                    seeing you and of taking<br/>you by the hand</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>It is now a little more than two<pb facs="BYM_Page_075" n="75"></pb><br/>years since your brothers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> had an oppor-<br/>tunity of becoming
                                    acquainted with their brothers<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little
                                            Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/topin1">Tuthinepee<persname key="topin1"></persname></a> and some other<br/>chiefs, they were
                                    glad of that opportunity of having a<br/>talk with them and of
                                    enquiring after the situation<br/>of their red brethren</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Your brothers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> had for<br/>some time entertained
                                    apprehensions that the many<br/>changes which were taking place
                                    in circumstances<br/>must greatly alter the situation of their
                                    red brethren<br/>and that the time was fast approaching in which
                                    is<br/>would be necessary for them to change there mode<br/>of
                                    living</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>After the talk with the chiefs whom<br/>we have just
                                    mentioned we were fully convinced that<br/>the time was come in
                                    which our red brethren ought<br/>to begin to cultivate their
                                    lands, that they ought to<br/>raise Corn and other grain, Cows,
                                    Sheep, Hogs, &amp; other<br/>Annimals, we then proposed to
                                    afford them some assis-<br/>tance, they appeared to be glad of
                                    the proposal and<br/>informed us that many of their people were
                                    disposed to<br/>turn their attention to the cultivation of the
                                    Earth<br/>--they also expressed a desire to be assisted by
                                    their<br/>brothers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Having been encouraged by the opportu-<br/>nity
                                    which we then had with our red brothers, we sent<br/>to the care
                                    of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> some plows,
                                    harness for Horses<br/>axes hoes and other implements of
                                    Husbandry, which were<pb facs="BYM_Page_076" n="76"></pb><br/>made for the use of our
                                    red brethren &amp; desired that<br/>they might be distributed
                                    amongst them as tokens of<br/>our friendship</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Your brothers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> received<br/>last fall through the
                                    hands of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>
                                    a<br/>Talk from their brothers the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little
                                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five
                                        Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a><br/>and others informing us that they had
                                    received the<br/>implements of Husbandry, and requested that
                                    their<br/>brothers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> would send some of their peo-<br/>ple
                                    into the country of their red brethren, for the<br/>purpose of
                                    seeing their situation and shewing them<br/>how to make use of
                                    the Tools saying they did not<br/>know how to begin</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>It is for this purpose that we have<br/>now come,
                                    and we again repeat that we rejoice we<br/>have this opportunity
                                    of seeing you and of taking you<br/>by the hand</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>In coming into the Country of<br/>our red brethren
                                    we have come with our eyes open and<br/>although we are affected
                                    with sorrow in believing that<br/>many of the red people suffer
                                    much for the want of food<br/>and for the want of cloathing yet
                                    our hearts have been<br/>made glad in seeing that it has pleased
                                    the great Spirit<br/>to give you a rich and valuable Country,
                                    because that<br/>we know it is out of the Earth that food and
                                    cloathing<br/>come. We are sure brothers that with but little
                                    labour &amp;<br/>attention you may raise much more corn and
                                    other<br/>grain, than will be necessary for yourselves, your
                                    women<pb facs="BYM_Page_077" n="77"></pb><br/>and children and may also with great
                                    ease raise many<br/>more horses, cows, sheep, hogs and other
                                    valuable animals<br/>than will be necessary for your own use we
                                    are also con-<br/>fident that if you will pursue our method in
                                    the<br/>cultivation of your lands that you will live in
                                    much<br/>greater ease &amp; plenty and with much less fatigue
                                    &amp; toil<br/>than attend hunting for a subsistence</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We are fully convinced that if you will<br/>adopt
                                    our mode of cultivating the Earth and of raising<br/>useful
                                    animals that you will find it to be a mode<br/>of living not
                                    only far more plentiful and much less<br/>fatiguing but also a
                                    mode of living much more cer-<br/>tain and which will expose
                                    your bodies less to the<br/>inclemences of the weather than is
                                    attendant upon hunting<br/>it will lead you to have fixed
                                    homes—you will build<br/>comfortable dwelling houses for
                                    yourselves, your women<br/>and children, where you may be
                                    sheltered from the rain<br/>from the frost and from the snow,
                                    and where you may enjoy<br/>in plenty the reward of your
                                    labour</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>In laying these things before you we have
                                    no<br/>other motive than a desire of heart for the
                                    improvement<br/>the bennefit and the welfare of our red brethren
                                    &amp; therefore<br/>it is that we speak with freedom and we hope
                                    that what<br/>we have to say will go in at one Ear and not come
                                    out<br/>at the other but that it will be remembered by our
                                    red<br/>brothers, for we know that we shall not be ashamed
                                    of<br/>what we say when in time to come you compare the
                                    things<pb facs="BYM_Page_078" n="78"></pb><br/>we are saying to you with your
                                    experience in practising<br/>them</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We will mention that the time was<br/>when the
                                    forefathers of your brothers, the white people lived<br/>beyond
                                    the great water in the same manner that our<br/>red brothers now
                                    live, the winters can yet be counted<br/>when they went almost
                                    naked, when they procured their<br/>living by fishing and by the
                                    bow and arrow in hunting &amp;<br/>when they lived in houses no
                                    better than yours. they<br/>were encouraged by some who came
                                    from towards<br/>the sun rising and lived amongst them to
                                    change<br/>their mode of living—they did change—they
                                    cultivated<br/>the Earth, and we are sure the change was a
                                    happy<br/>one</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We are not ashamed to acknowledge<br/>that the time
                                    was, when our forefathers rejoiced at<br/>finding a wild Plum
                                    Tree or at killing a little<br/>game, and that they wandered up
                                    &amp; down living on<br/>the uncertain supplies of fishing and
                                    hunting, but<br/>brothers for your encouragement we mention,
                                    that<br/>by turning their attention to the cultivation of
                                    the<br/>Earth, instead of the Plum tree, they soon had
                                    orchards<br/>of many kinds of good Fruit—instead of the wild
                                    game<br/>they soon had large numbers of Cattle, of horses of
                                    sheep<br/>of hogs and other useful animals, and instead
                                    of<br/>their forests in many places they had large fields
                                    of<br/>Corn and other Grain, as also many other
                                    valuable<br/>productions of the Earth</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We hope your Eyes will be open to see clearly<pb facs="BYM_Page_079" n="79"></pb><br/>the things which are best for you, and that
                                    you<br/>will desire to pursue them—we are sure brothers, that
                                    it<br/>is in the heart of your father the President of the
                                    Un-<br/>ited States, to assist his red children in the
                                    cultivati-<br/>on of the Earth, and to render them services
                                    which<br/>will be greatly for their benefit and welfare. We
                                    hope<br/>that your exertions to change your present mode
                                    of<br/>living will be so plain to him that he will see
                                    them<br/>which will encourage him to continue to aid you
                                    in<br/>your endeavours</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We have spoken plainly—we<br/>desire to speak plain
                                    we will now tell you that we<br/>have not come merely to talk,
                                    with you, we have come<br/>prepared to render you a little
                                        <del>service</del> assistance—our<br/>beloved brother
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, who is now
                                    present has come<br/>along with us, to cultivate for you a field
                                    of Corn, also<br/>to shew you how to raise some of the other
                                    productions of<br/>the Earth. He knows how to use the Plow, the
                                    Hoe, the Axe<br/>and other implements of the husbandry</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We will here ask you are you still desirous<br/>to
                                    be assisted by us in the cultivation of the Earth? if<br/>you
                                    say you are, our bother who we have just mentioned<br/>will
                                    continue with you during the summer. We shall<br/>leave it with
                                    you to shew him the spot where to begin<br/>to work. Brothers he
                                    has left a farm—he has left a wife<br/>and five small children
                                    who are very dear to him. He has<br/>come from a sincere desire
                                    to be useful to our red brethren<br/>brothers his motives are
                                    pure he will ask no reward from<br/>you his greatest reward will
                                    be in the satisfaction he will<pb facs="BYM_Page_080" n="80"></pb><br/>feel in finding
                                    you inclined to take hold of the<br/>same tools which he takes
                                    hold of, to receive from him<br/>instruction in the cultivation
                                    of your Lands and to<br/>pursue the example he will set you</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We hope you will make the situation of<br/>our
                                    brother as comfortable as circumstances will admit<br/>we hope
                                    also, that many of your young men will be<br/>willing to be
                                    taught by him to use the plough, the<br/>Hoe &amp; other
                                    implements of husbandry—for we are sure<br/>brothers, that as
                                    you take hold of such tools as<br/>are in the hands of the white
                                    People, that you will<br/>find them to be to you like having
                                    additional hands<br/>you will also find brothers, that by using
                                    them, they<br/>will enable you to do many things which
                                    without<br/>them cannot be performed</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>There is one thing more which we<br/>wish to add,
                                    your brothers the white people in order<br/>to get their lands
                                    cultivated find it necessary that<br/>their young men should be
                                    employed in it &amp; not their<br/>women. Women are less than
                                    men, they are not as<br/>able to endure fatigue as men. It is
                                    the business of<br/>our women to be employed in our houses, to

                                    dress<br/>food for themselves and families, to make cloathes
                                    for<br/>the men and the rest of their families, to keep
                                    the<br/>cloathing of their families clean &amp; to take care
                                    of<br/>their children</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We desire not to mention too<br/>many things to you
                                    but we must add a little further<pb facs="BYM_Page_081" n="81"></pb><br/>we are fully of
                                    the mind brothers that if you will<br/>turn your attention to
                                    the cultivation of the Earth to<br/>raising the different kinds
                                    of grain, to building comfort-<br/>table dwelling houses for
                                    your families, to raising useful<br/>animals, amongst others
                                    sheep for the advantage of the<br/>wool in making cloathing, to
                                    raising flax and hemp<br/>for your linen, and your Young women
                                    learn to<br/>spin and weave, that your lives will be much
                                    easier<br/>and happyer than at present, that you will be
                                    much<br/>less exposed to diseases, and that your numbers
                                    will<br/>increase and not diminuish. As we before
                                    observed<br/>brothers your Land is good, it is far better than
                                    the<br/>land the white people cultivate near the great
                                    water<br/>we are persuaded that your land will produce
                                    dou-<br/>ble the quantity of any kind of grain, of flax of
                                    hemp<br/>with the same labour that is necessary near
                                    the<br/>great water</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We shall now finish what we<br/>have to say with
                                    informing you that all the corn<br/>and other productions of the
                                    Earth, which our brother<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip

<said who="lturt1"><p>Brothers<br/>It appears to me necessary that I
                                        should<br/>give you an immediate answer as you are about
                                        to<br/>return to your families from whence you came</p>
<p>Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>We are all pleased to see you here
                                        &amp; to<br/>take our brothers the Quakers through you by
                                        the<br/>hand, we rejoice that the Great Spirit has
                                        appointed<br/>that we should this day meet, for we believe
                                        that<br/>this meeting will be of the utmost
                                        consequence<br/>to your red brethren</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>What you have said we have
                                        carefully<br/>gathered up we have placed it in our hearts
                                        in<br/>order that it might be communicated to our
                                        posterity<br/>--we are convinced that what you have said
                                        is<br/>for the good of your red brethren, we are also
                                        convinced<br/>that our chiefs and warriors, and our women
                                        &amp; children<br/>will be all of our opinion, and will be
                                        glad when they<br/>hear what you have said</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We take you now by the hand and through<br/>you
                                        we take the people who sent you here by the hand<br/>and
                                        assure you that we are pleased, that the Great<br/>Spirit,
                                        has let us see each other, and converse together<br/>upon
                                        the subjects which you have communicated to us</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>You see there is not a large number of
                                        us<br/>here what you have said to us will not remain
                                        with<br/>those who are here alone, it will be communicated
                                        to<br/>all your red brethren in this country and I again
                                        repeat<br/>that I am convinced they will be glad to hear
                                        what<pb facs="BYM_Page_083" n="83"></pb><br/>you have said to us—to our women
                                        and to our children</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>When we saw you with the rest of our
                                        brothers<br/>in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> upwards of two years ago, I
                                        expect yo recollect<br/>perfectly the conversation between
                                        us at that time and<br/>place, I there with my brother
                                        chiefs told you, that<br/>we were glad to find you, so much,
                                        disposed to assist us<br/>and our women &amp; children, we
                                        told you that your good<br/>wishes should be make known to
                                        all your red brethren<br/>in this country—this has been
                                        done</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Ever since that time I as well as some
                                        other<br/>of my brother chiefs have been endeavouring to
                                        turn<br/>the minds of our people towards the cultivation of
                                        the<br/>Earth but I am sorry to say we have not yet been
                                        able to<br/>effect any thing</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>As many of our chiefs and principal<br/>people
                                        are not present we could not now undertake to<br/>give you
                                        any pointed answer. We expect in a few<br/>moons there will
                                        be many of our people together at that<br/>time it will be
                                        proper that we should return you an<br/>answer to all the
                                        Subjects you now mention to us</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>The things you have said to us require
                                        our<br/>greatest attention—it appears to be really
                                        necessary<br/>we should deliberate upon them. In order to do
                                        so we<br/>must beg you to leave the paper upon which they
                                        are<br/>written that we may communicate them to our
                                        chiefs<br/>when they assemble</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>All the things you have said to day
                                        were<br/>certainly calculated for our good, you have
                                        enumerated<pb facs="BYM_Page_084" n="84"></pb><br/>to us the different kinds of
                                        Grain, and animals we<br/>ought to raise for our comfort,
                                        you have told us that<br/>if we adopt the plan you propose,
                                        we should want<br/>for nothing. This brothers myself and
                                        many of our<br/>people believe is true and we hope we shall
                                        finally be<br/>able to convince our young men that this is
                                        the<br/>plan we ought to adopt to get our living</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>You have come a long distance to
                                        render<br/>service to us we hope your visit will meet with
                                        the<br/>success you wish, you have been very particular
                                        in<br/>pointing out to us what will be for our good.
                                        You<br/>have been very particular in pointing out to us
                                        the<br/>duties of our women, and you have told us
                                        that<br/>in adopting your mode of living, our
                                        numbers<br/>would increase and not diminuish, in all this
                                        I<br/>perfectly agree with you and I hope the other
                                        chiefs<br/>will also</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We are pleased to hear you say you are<br/>going
                                        to leave one of your brothers with us to<br/>shew us in what
                                        manner you cultivate the Earth<br/>we shall endeavour
                                        brothers, to make his situation<br/>amongst us as agreeable
                                        to him as will be possible<br/>for us</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We are convinced the plan you propose<br/>will
                                        be highly advantageous to your red brethren—<br/>we are
                                        convinced you have observed very justly, that<br/>we shall
                                        not be so liable to sickness—we are certain<pb facs="BYM_Page_085" n="85"></pb><br/>we shall then be able to make a more
                                        comfortable<br/>living with less labour than at present and
                                        we hope<br/>this will be the opinion of us all</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>I again repeat I am extremely glad to
                                        hear<br/>the things you have said we will keep them in
                                        our<br/>hearts for the good of our young men, our women
                                        &amp;<br/>our children. I have now delivered you th
                                        esenti-<br/>ments of our people that are present<br/>--Here
                                        he made a short pause then added—</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Assure your people who sent you here,
                                        tell<br/>your old chiefs, that we are obliged to them,
                                        for<br/>their friendly offers to assist us in changing our
                                        present<br/>mode of living—tell them it is a work that
                                        cannot<br/>be done immediately, but that we are that
                                        way<br/>disposed and we hope it will take place
                                        gradually.</p></said>

<said who="lturt1"><p>Brothers<br/>My heart is so overjoyed with
                                        what you<br/>have said that I find I forgot to mention one
                                        of the<br/>most important things. At the time we first met
                                        at<br/>this place, the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five
                                            Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> and myself formed some<br/>idea of
                                        your business, we expected, that you had come<br/>to do for
                                        us things which you had proposed to us when<br/>in
                                            <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> and
                                        consulted each other upon the<br/>Answer necessary to return
                                        to you in every respect, and<br/>I now find that our
                                        conjecture was right</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>The sentiments which I have delivered to<br/>you
                                        were his sentiments, you have now told us that<pb facs="BYM_Page_086" n="86"></pb><br/>your brother has a mind to live amongst us
                                        to<br/>shew us how to cultivate the Earth and have
                                        desired<br/>us to shew him the spot where to begin</p>
<p>We agreed then that he should be at neither<br/>of our
                                        villages least our younger brothers might be<br/>jealous of
                                        our taking him to ourselves. We have<br/>determined to place
                                        him on the Wabash whre some<br/>of our families will follow
                                        him, where our young<br/>men I hope will flock to him and
                                        where he will be<br/>able to instruct them as he wishes</p>
<p>This is all I have to say. I could all day<br/>repeat the
                                        sentiments I have already expressed, also<br/>how much I
                                        have been gratified in seeing and<br/>hearing from our
                                        brothers, but this is not necessary<br/>--I am sorry the
                                        chiefs of our Country are not all<br/>present, that they
                                        might all hear what you have<br/>said and have an
                                        opportunity to talk with you</p></said>

<p>At the close of the conference we inf-<br/>ormed the Indians that we
                            wished to accompany<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
                            to the river <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">Wabash<placename key="wabas"></placename></a> the place
                            assigned for<br/>him to commence his operations and requested
                            them<br/>to appoint one of their number to accompany us there<br/>the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> replied that he
                            would be pleased to<br/>accompany us himself, but that he was too
                            much<br/>indisposed to go such a distance, they
                            accordingly<br/>appointed a guide, who together with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a><br/>accopanyed us. We were
                            much pleased with the situation<pb facs="BYM_Page_087" n="87"></pb><br/>of the place as also
                            with the soil, it being equal in<br/>fertility to any land in the
                            western Country. Near it<br/>are two good seats for Mills, one on the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">Wabash<placename key="wabas"></placename></a>, with-<br/>out injuring
                            its navigation and the other on a <br/>handsome stream ½ a mile below.
                            We may add<br/>that this place is situated between 30 &amp; 40 miles
                            S.W. of<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, after viewing
                            the Land adjacent, staking<br/>out the place for <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> to build his house and pointing<br/>out the place
                            for him to clear and enclose &amp;c &amp;c we re-<br/>turned to

<p>On the 15 (having previously concluded to return<br/>by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> and thence across the lake) we
                            commenced our<br/>journey homewards and descended the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/miamr">Miami<placename key="miamr"></placename></a> of the<br/>Lake to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ottor">ottoway river<placename key="ottor"></placename></a> then down the same to

                            an<br/>opportunity of observing several Villages of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a><br/>and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/odawa">Ottoway<orgname key="odawa"></orgname></a> Indians as also several villages belonging<br/>to

                            particular at<br/> which we spent a little time contains about 100
                            families<br/>and is known by the name of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/browt">Browns
                                Town<placename key="browt"></placename></a> &amp; the Rock<br/>--at this village they have made
                            greater progress in<br/>civilization than any other of the Western
                            Indians—<br/>They have comfortable dwelling houses, 200 head of
                            Cattle<br/>--make Butter &amp; Cheese, have horses &amp; Hogs, raise a
                            sufficiency<br/>of corn &amp; oats &amp;c &amp;c we here saw one barn
                            well filled with<br/>wheat in the Straw, the land they cultivate is
                            enclosed<br/>under good fences &amp; they have also Peach &amp; apple
                            orchards</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_088" n="88"></pb>
<p>At this Village as well at several others, we were<br/>informed that the
                            Wyandots residing at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>
                            had<br/>within a few years turned their attention to agricul-<br/>ture,
                            and had made considerable progress in fencing<br/>in their Lands and in
                            raising corn cattle &amp;c</p>
<p>On the <date when="1804-05-02">2nd of the 5th Mo.</date> we left
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> &amp;<br/>descended the

                            engaged a conveyance to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/conan">Canandarque<placename key="conan"></placename></a>, whilst waiting for the conveyance
                            we<br/>visited the principal village of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senneka Indians<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/>situated on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creek<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, we saw several of their<br/>principal
                            chiefs and young men engaged in ploughing<br/>--to one of these ploughs
                            we saw 6 oxes—others were<br/>busily engaged in cleaving and preparing
                            land for<br/>cultivation</p>
<p>On the <date when="1804-05-13">13</date> we left <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffc1">Buffaloe Creek<placename key="buffc1"></placename></a>, continuing<br/>our journey through the

                            way we passed through<br/>a large village of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, then down the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/mohaw">Mohawk<placename key="mohaw"></placename></a> to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> and from thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a><br/>where we took water for New York and from

<p>We further inform that some time after our<br/>return, we received a
                            letter from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
                                dated<br/><date when="1804-06-26">6 Mo 26</date> last which informs
                            that he had been afflicted<br/>5 weeks from the time we left him with a
                            Sciatic<pb facs="BYM_Page_089" n="89"></pb><br/>complaint so that it was with difficulty he
                            could<br/>go about, which has no doubt disabled him from do-<br/>ing as
                            much as he other ways would have done. He<br/>informs that he had
                            between 16 &amp; 20 acres of land<br/>enclosed under a substancial fence
                            8 rails high, and<br/>that he had planted about 8 acres of corn,
                            which<br/>looked very well—since which we have received an-<br/>other
                            letter from him dated <date when="1804-08-26">8 Mo 26</date> which
                            informs<br/>that he has enjoyed a good state of health since he<br/>had
                            recovered from the complaint above mentioned<br/>that his situation was
                            a healthy one and that the<br/>springs of water were very good—he
                            further states that<br/>his corn made an excellent appearance, having 2
                            &amp; 3<br/>Ears on a stalk that he had sown one acre in Tur-<br/>nips
                            which looked well, that a number of Indians<br/>had been encamped near
                            him for the purpose of<br/>hunting, that only one family had setled
                            perma-<br/>nently at his station which onsisted on 7 grown
                            persons<br/>who he says have been industrious and attended to<br/>his
                            directions, that the Indians have been friendly &amp;<br/>some of them
                            very sociable, and that 55 Eal river<br/>Indians had been at his
                            station, who acknowledged<br/>that his corn was equal to any they had
                            ever seen on<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">Wabash<placename key="wabas"></placename></a>. He also
                            says he has had a conference<br/>with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/samuel">Samuel<persname key="samuel"></persname></a> the principal chief of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal
                                river Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a><br/>who informed him that he expects the
                            Indians of his<br/>village will settle at his station, and further
                            informs<pb facs="BYM_Page_090" n="90"></pb><br/>that they would gladly receive assistance
                            from<br/>Friends. Some farming utensils such as Plows, Hoes<br/>&amp;
                            axes he says would be very acceptable. This chief<br/>added that he does
                            not expect they will make a<br/>great progress immediately but thinks it
                            a proper<br/>time to lay a foundation for their children and is<br/>in
                            hopes the present establishment will make a<br/>begining. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> also informs, that when<br/>he
                            first went to the wabash he built a temporary<br/>house 14 feet square
                            and expected soon after the date<br/>of his last letter to begin another
                            to be 16 by 32 feet<br/>and 1 ½ Stories high, and observes he very
                            sensibly feel<br/>the lonesomeness of his situation, but on reflecting
                            upon<br/>the business in which he is engaged and the<br/>distressed
                            situation of the poor Indians he feels no<br/>cause of regret</p>

                                of<br/>living, I told him this was several times he had<pb facs="BYM_Page_092" n="92"></pb><br/>mentioned this to us, now will take hold of it<br/>and
                                receive it. I told him we wanted it soon<br/>as I was an old man and
                                wanted to see it before<br/>I died, if once I see it I will die in
                                pleasure to<br/>think I have left my women &amp; children in
                                comfort<br/>one year ago from this my grand children
                                the<br/>Mohickenany came to renew their friendship with
                                us<br/>Hendricks told us they had brought what the white<br/>people
                                had put into their hands, when it was<br/>given to us it gave us
                                great pleasure and we thought<br/>of our grandfathers and have
                                brought it to you<br/>one year ago <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tharr1">Governor

                                same subject. I told him I<br/>had consented to it at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/vince">Vincennes<placename key="vince"></placename></a> three years ago
                                &amp;<br/>would never change my mind—now again<br/>yesterday you
                                have told us the same thing—I have<br/>consented to it and will
                                never alter my mind. I<br/>have now answered you again I wish you to
                                begin<br/>immediately and afford us the assistance you offer<br/>us
                                by building us houses and fences after which we<br/>can cultivate
                                our Lands—I will never change my<br/>mind—it is all I have to

<said who="lturt1"><p>To the Quakers of Baltimore<br/>My Brothers &amp;
                                Friends<br/>We were glad to see our friends<br/>that came from you
                                better than 2 moons ago, we<br/>were glad to find it had pleased the
                                great spirit<br/>to keep you in the same mind you were in
                                when<br/>we spoke to you in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></p>
<p>Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>I told you when you delived<br/>your
                                speech to us at this place I was sorry there<br/>were not more of
                                our people convened to hear you<br/>I told you your brothers were
                                thankful for the<br/>Tools of agriculture you sent for us to the
                                care<br/>of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>. I told
                                you my brothers, that<br/>your talk should be delivered to all your
                                red<br/>brethren on their first meeting at this place</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Your talk was delivered to us by<br/>our friend
                                    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm. Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> two days ago you
                                will see<br/>the answer to it of out grandfathers made
                                yesterday<br/>which informs you we are thankful for the
                                kindness<br/>you offer, and it is their wish you would
                                continue<br/>your kindness towards them. We the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> &amp;<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Pottowattomies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> also take you by the hand &amp;
                                assure<br/>you we thank you for the goodness you have had
                                in<br/>offering to afford your red brethren assistance—a
                                thing<br/>they are so much in need of</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_094" n="94"></pb>
<p>Brothers<br/>The implements of husbandry that you<br/>sent to this
                                place have been all distributed by the<br/>person you sent them to
                                expect 2 ploughs which he<br/>now offers to any of us who will make
                                use of<br/>them. We hope some of our people will be disposed<br/>to
                                use them</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>You have been particular in<br/>pointing out to us what
                                we ought to do for<br/>our own good—we are convinced that if
                                we<br/>adopt the mode of living you propose to us<br/>it will be for
                                our own good—still brothers<br/>we find it impossible to make this
                                change<br/>immediately and although a number of our<br/>young men
                                now laugh at the Idea. Still<br/>brothers, this does not discourage
                                us and we hope it will<br/>not discourage you from continuing your
                                friendship towards<br/>us—we know the time is not far from us that
                                will<br/>compel us to adopt the mode of living you propose</p>
<p>Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>Our friend you left amongst us<br/>to
                                instruct us in the use of the tools you gave us, is<br/>now at the
                                place we assigned him. Though it was<br/>late when <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> commenced his work, still
                                we<br/>are convinced it will be for the service of your<br/>brothers
                                and although we are unable to say what sort of<br/>a crop he will
                                raise, yet let it be good or bad it will<pb facs="BYM_Page_095" n="95"></pb><br/>be of
                                service to us &amp; when ever our brother informs<br/>us he is done
                                his work and ready to return we will<br/>attend to the distribution
                                of the corn agreeable to your<br/>request</p>
<p>Brothers &amp; Friends<br/>These are the sentiments of your<br/>red
                                brethren that compose this council, we all take<br/>you by the hand
                                and hope that the great spirit, will<br/>always keep your minds
                                disposed to serve your red bre-<br/>thren, should you have any
                                communications to make to<br/>us you know the mode of sending them
                                to us</p></said>

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> informs in his letter
                    that<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Delawares Miamies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal river<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> Indians have<br/>agreed that the United States
                    should send suitable<br/>men amongst them to instruct them in
                    building<br/>Houses, making fences &amp; instead of giving them their<br/>yearly
                    Annuities in goods and he says in a letter rec.<br/>from him dated the <date when="1804-08-31">31st of the 8th Mo.</date> that he is only<br/>waiting the
                    directions of the Secretary of War to put<br/> the plan in execution, and gives
                    it as his opinion it<br/>will be of the greatest bennefit to the Indians
                    to<br/>keep one or Two good white men at each Village<br/>to work with them and
                    to advise and assist them they<br/>to receive a salary equal to their work and
                    what<br/>they raise to be divided amongst the Indians of the<br/>Village and
                    adds, that this plan will give room for the<br/>United States as well as the
                    Society of Friends to shew the<br/>Indians how much they have their happiness at
                    heart.</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_096" n="96"></pb>
<p>He also observes that the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal river Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> (a tribe
                    <br/> of the Miami Nation) intend to settle on the <geogname key="wabas">wabash</geogname>
<br/>at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis’ station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>.</p>
<p> From the foregoing the committee may form <br/>an opinion of the situation &amp;
                    disposition of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Mi- -ami Delaware<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> &amp;
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal river Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> — from what we <br/>observed
                    &amp; from information received whilst in the <br/>Indian Country, but little
                    can very soon be expected <br/>from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Pottowattomies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> and the other nations of <br/>Indians residing to
                    the N. &amp; W of them they being <br/>more remote from the white setlers and
                    their country <br/>better for fishing and hunting they do not feel the <br/>same
                    necessity to turn their attention to the cultivation <br/>of the Earth</p>
<p>The committee may observe by the <br/>speech of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/toeth1">Toethteboxhe<persname key="toeth1"></persname></a> that the Delawares are desirous <br/>of assistance
                    — We frequently whilst amongst the <br/>Indians were informed that as much may
                    be expected <br/>from them as from any of the Indians — many of <br/>them from
                    having formerly near the white setlers in <br/>in Pennsylvania speak our
                    language and are par- <br/>-tial to our manners and customs</p>
<p>We were also informed that the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> re-
                    <br/>-siding on the <geogname key="augl">Auglaize river</geogname> are making
                    some <br/>progress in civilization we were told that some of <br/>them had 40

                    circumstances <br/>we are of the sentiment that there is cause of encou-

<br/>as expressed in his reply to our address that their <br/>changing their
                    present mode of living is a work <br/>that cannot be done immediately, but that
                    a number <br/>of the Indians are that way disposed and we hope it <br/>will take

<p>The committee on Indians concerns<br/>appointed by the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/bym">Yearly Meeting of Baltimore<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a><br/>being of opinion that a
                            reciprocal advantage<br/>would arrise and their wishes be promoted
                            by<br/>a free correspondence with other committees of<br/>the same
                            nature have for this reason written to<br/>you at the present time and
                            also being fully<br/>persuaded that the great work we have in
                            hand<br/>may be better accomplished by an union of<br/>sympathy &amp;
                            sentiment, than perhaps it could by<br/>either committee alone</p>
<p>In the progress of the arduous undertaking<br/>of assisting the Indian
                            natives in agriculture &amp;<br/>other useful arts of civil life this
                            committee<br/>have sent several deputations of its members<br/>into
                            their Country first to ascertain their disposi-<br/>tions &amp; wants
                            &amp; after that to render them such<br/>assistance &amp; instruction as
                            was in our power, &amp;<br/>we have the satisfaction to inform that
                            from<br/>the report of the last of those deputations, our<br/>efforts
                            are like to be crowned with as much success<br/>as (from the means in
                            our power to employ) we had<pb facs="BYM_Page_101" n="101"></pb><br/>reason to expect. That a
                            number of the Indians<br/>appear very much inclined to cultivate the
                            Earth &amp;<br/>no longer depend on their accustomed precarious<br/>mode
                            of procuring subsistence</p>
<p>The different Nations or tribes of Indians<br/>inhabiting the country

                            are these that have fallen under our particular<br/>notice. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware Nation<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> now inhabit the<br/>same

<p>By information received from our last deputation<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> are now very much disposed to
                            receive<br/>such information and assistance as their white
                            brethren<br/>may be disposed to render them, this appears to be the<br/>
                            decided determination of the most antient &amp; influential<br/>of their
                            chiefs and the much increasing wish of their<br/>young men. This nation

                            to<br/>them in goods. They have requested at their last<br/>Council that
                            this sum may be expended in the<br/>employment of suitable persons to
                            instruct them<br/>in the arts of civil life. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> have also<br/>requested, that their annuity may
                            be paid them in<br/>young Cattle, this information is pleasing to us,
                            as<br/>it in a considerable degree shews the sincerity of<br/>their
                            professions of willingness to abandon their present<br/>mode of life for
                            one from which every comfort may<br/>be expected with much greater
                            certainty</p>
<p>We may Remark also that we at the present<br/>time have only given
                            assistance to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Ealriver<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> Nations and from the limited state

<p>Brothers<br/>You may also remember that as you<br/>could not at that time
                            give us a full answer<br/>you promised to forward it after the meeting
                            of the<br/>grand Council which was to be held shortly after</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Your brethren the Quakers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a><br/>have ever since that time been waiting to

                                Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> who remained with them during the past<br/>season
                            has returned with them during the past<br/>season has returned. He
                            informs us that he spent<br/>the season agreeably with them and was
                            favoured<br/>to enjoy a good portion of health whilst there—<br/>He
                            raised 400 bushels of corn but this was not divided<br/>when he left
                            that Country on account of the dispersed<br/>situation of the Indians,
                            he had however secured it<br/>in substantial well covered cribs, and had
                                engaged<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> to
                            attend with the chiefs appointed<br/>to make the distribution &amp; has
                            no doubt but it will<br/>be equitably divided on the return of the
                            Indians<br/>from their hunting Camps. He also raised
                            Turnips<br/>Potatoes, Cucumbers, Water Melons, Pumpkins,
                            Beans<br/>Parsnips &amp; other garden vegetables and left at
                            the<br/>farm he had been cultivating (with the family of<br/>Indians
                            with whom he resided) 23 Hogs &amp; Pigs 7 of which<br/>were in good
                            order to kill, and would weigh 1500 lbs<pb facs="BYM_Page_107" n="107"></pb><br/>these he
                            engaged <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> to attend to
                            the<br/>killing &amp; Salting of they were small when brought to<br/>the
                            farm in the spring and had no other food than<br/>what they gathered in
                            the woods. He also built a<br/>house 32 feet long &amp; 17 feet wide 1 ½
                            stories high, with<br/>floors and partitions—one end of which he
                            finished</p>
<p>He further informs that the Indians who remained<br/>with him were very
                            industrious and attended to his directions<br/>that the young women
                            wished to work out in preparing the<br/>ground and in tending the corn
                            from which he had<br/>dissuaded them. And as some spinning wheels had
                            just<br/>arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> which
                            had been sent on by<br/>government he had encouraged these young women
                            to<br/>go there and learn to spin &amp; knot of a woman
                            that<br/>happened to be there—this they did and soon learned<br/>both to
                            spin &amp; knit and that he left them knitting yarn<br/>of their own
                            spinning and gives it as his opinion that<br/>there is encouragement for
                            friends to persevere. A<br/>considerable number of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal river Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> are about to<br/>settle near the place
                            he cultivated. This being it that<br/>country has been attended with
                            considerable expence but<br/>should another person go out to them the
                            disbursement<br/>need not be as great a considerable piece of land
                            being<br/>now enclosed and a house built. He also informs that<br/>one
                            of his horses died a few days before he left that country<br/>and that
                            previous to his departure he was with a number<pb facs="BYM_Page_108" n="108"></pb><br/>of
                            principal Indian chiefs who requested him to<br/>inform friends that
                            they and the Indians generally were<br/>much obliged to friends for the
                            assistance they had given<br/>them, and hoped we would continue our
                            friendship<br/>towards them and that nothing might happen
                            to<br/>discourage us, he also says that all the Indians he
                            was<br/>amongst were very friendly as was also <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a><br/>&amp; the other offices of the

                            loss of his house, we have also setled with the<br/>Treasurer and find
                            in his hand a ballance of $273 63/100 </p>

<p>In compliance with what appeared<br/>to be the sense of the Committee
                            when last con-<br/>vened, we endeavoured to procure a suitable

                            but no suitable one having offered to engage<br/>in the service and
                            taking into consideration the<br/>advanced season of the year and the
                            dissatisfied &amp;<br/>unsetled situation of the Indians at that time
                            on<br/>account of a sale of Land that had been made<br/>by some of the
                            tribes to the United States (which<br/>uneasiness we are glad to hear
                            has since been<br/>removed) our thought it might for the

<p>As members of a committee<br/>on Indian concerns appointed by the
                                    Society of<br/>Friends we address thee, and inform that our

                                    happiness<br/>of the Indians has not abated, and inasmuch
                                    as<br/>we made some progress in this interesting
                                    under-<br/>taking by cultivating for them a field of
                                    Corn<br/>&amp;c the last year we are desirous not yet to
                                    abandon<br/>it.</p>
<p>It has been our wish to send a person to<br/>take the place of
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> in aiding
                                    the<br/>Indians the present season but the information
                                    we<br/>have received of the unsetled and dissatisfied situation
                                    of<br/>the Indians added to the difficulty of finding a
                                    suitable<br/>character willing at this time to engage in
                                    the<br/>service, has been such that from the already
                                    advanced<br/>period in the Spring, we have no hope of
                                    succeeding, and<br/>after a full conference on the subject we
                                    have come<br/>to the conclusion to ask of thee (in addition to
                                    the<br/>many kindness we have to acknowledge we
                                    have<br/>received) the favour of interesting thyself to
                                    procure<br/>for us the most suitable character in thy power
                                    who<br/>under thy direction will plough the land
                                        which<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
                                    cultivated the last season and plant<br/>it in Corn, in the

                                    assisted by the Indians—after their corn is<br/>planted we are
                                    willing to believe they will be able<br/>to mannage it should a
                                    second ploughing however<br/>be necessary we wish that also to
                                    be done, this<br/>person may also prepare for them a garden of
                                    the<br/>most useful vegetables, which they may
                                    afterwards<br/>easily mannage, of the descriptions we leave
                                    thee<br/>to judge. This little service rendered to them<br/>the
                                    present year we hope will convince the<br/>Indians that we have

                                    a compliance<br/>with the request which we have now made

                                    the work which we now do for<br/>them, is a small token of the
                                    continuance of our<br/>love for them and that we hope

<p>We have since received his Answer in which he<br/>says he will loose no

                            making rails to<br/>fence in 40 Acres for them and also that 3 persons
                            more<br/>were at work for the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eal river
                                Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> ½ a mile<br/>below Dennis’ Station—that they had
                            25 Acres cleard<br/>and ready for the Plough and he expects would
                            have<br/>50 or 60 Acres fenced in by the <date when="1805-06-01">1st fo
                                the 6 Mo.</date> He<br/>further adds that he is not certain what
                            number<br/>of families will reside at that place but expects 25<br/>the
                            present season and he is confident the settlement<br/>will increase very
                            fast. The Indian that worked<br/>all last season with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> was about<br/>building himself
                            a comfortable house and had about<pb facs="BYM_Page_113" n="113"></pb><br/>2 acres more of
                            Ground cleared and was ploughing<br/>in the field that was cleared by
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>—the<br/>Hogs that
                            were left there had increased to 100 in<br/>number</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> further informs that
                            there would<br/>be 100 Acres of Land under good fence at the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/lturtown">LittleTurtles Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a> (15 Miles north
                            of Dennis’ Station) by the<br/>1st of the 6 Mo.—that they had obtained a
                            large number<br/>of Hogs and some Cows and he doubts not but<br/>the
                            Indians will soon see, that it is easier to raise<br/>food than to
                            procure it by Hunting and adds<br/>that Friends may see by the very
                            great progress they<br/>have made in agriculture &amp; civilization
                            since <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> was amongst
                            them<br/>that they only want good men to reside amongst<br/>them to
                            teach them how to work</p>
<p>We expected to have received information from<br/>him giving an account
                            of the progress the Indians<br/>are making this summer but have not yet
                            heard<br/>from him</p>

<p>Your acceptable Epistle of the<br/><date when="1804-10">10 Mo

                            to our Red brethren<br/>is earnestly desired, being persuaded that the

                            welfare<br/>of this people, originated in motives truely

                            think it has been owned<br/>and blessed.</p>
<p>Our labours on behalf of the Indians have<br/>yielded as much solid peace
                            as most services in<br/>which we have been engaged, and what

<p>A report from our committee on Indian<br/>concerns was now produced, which being

<p>Some time since a committee of<br/>seven men were sent to us by your
                            Society at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a><br/>--the
                            occasion of their coming was to attend to the<br/>business we were
                            speaking of when I was at Baltimore<br/>the next spring there were
                            letters sent out and the com-<br/>mittee came out least the letters
                            should have been<br/>lost, that they might communicate the same
                            things<br/>sent in them, i e</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>The reasons of our coming are we not<br/>knowing but that
                            the letters might be lost, for in<br/>those letters, were contained all
                            the information;<br/>How it happened when we got first acquainted

                            at the same<br/>time we express our friendship for all Nations;
                            The<br/>Quakers have taken up a plan for doing something<br/>for the

                            who give you presents every year<br/>--the President gives 1000 $
                            annually, we have a design<br/>to go on the same footing, and give $1000
                            a year, if<br/>the chiefs our Brothers would accept of it. We
                            tell<br/>you brothers we want to take care of you and give<br/>you good

                            be good and of more<br/>value than those the President gives, if the

                            got the Presidents permit,--These matters are setled<br/>and we have now
                            got $100 on hand towards building<br/>you a Mill, we will also help you
                            in cultivating<br/>your lands and in building houses—another
                            thing<br/>brothers we wish you to send some of your children<br/>to us,
                            and we will school them and give them learning<br/>as the Wyandots are
                            the only Nation that have no<pb facs="BYM_Page_120" n="120"></pb><br/>learned men amongst them,
                            the parents of the<br/>children may choose what their children shall

<p>This is all we understood was offered to us as<br/>explained by out

                            My<br/>answer then was, that I would not give you an answer<br/>until I
                            went to see the Brown’s Town chiefs, which<br/>should be done in the
                            course of that summer, the<br/>chiefs when we met thought it too
                            difficult to go<br/>they desired me to write on to you, and
                            what<br/>ever I did they would agree to</p>
<p>Brethren Quakers give attention!<br/>I send a few words<br/>to you now;
                            the plan you have thought of is<br/>a very good one, and all the chiefs
                            thank you for<br/>having compassion on us, for we are poor &amp;
                            needy,<br/>but there is one difficulty in the way, your res-<br/>pecting
                            two Nations, more than the rest, we say,<br/>the difficulty with the
                            chiefs is your respecting, two<br/>nations more than the rest—other
                            nations might<br/>look upon us with envy, and as they are not men
                            of<br/>knowledge, they might fall on us and cut us off<br/>this is the
                            only difficulty in the way we wish<br/>our brethren Quakers to consider
                            this matter, &amp;<br/>the danger we shall be in, and if they are
                            deter-<br/>mined to help us to send us word in the spring early<br/>and
                            also to see how many nations they will help<pb facs="BYM_Page_121" n="121"></pb><br/>if you send
                            on in the spring and are still de-<br/>termined to help us, we shall
                            then have matters<br/>regulated and will accept your offer</p>
<p>Brothers!<br/>We have both been under the same diffi-<br/>culty it is
                            five years since the brethren were here<br/>and I have heard no word,
                            and finally concluded<br/>that they had given up doing any thing,
                            until<br/>this letter came into my hands—we all thank<br/>you heartily
                            for not giving it up altogether. In<br/>regard to the letter now before
                            us, the chiefs at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/browt">Brown’s Town<placename key="browt"></placename></a>
                            are pleased and accept the offer, we<br/>now leave it with our brethren
                            if they conclude to<br/>help us either to send us another letter, and
                            give<br/>us notice or send the things they propose, we wish<br/>four
                            pair of plow Irons at this place</p>
<p>Brethren!<br/>If you see fit to send a letter this fall<br/>or early in
                            the spring, or to send on your things di-<br/>rectly, we leave the
                            matter with yourselves. In<br/>regard to schools Brethren, by that time
                            some of<br/>our people will determine on the children, they<br/>will
                            send to school and what they shall study</p>
<p>The chiefs return you thanks that you have<br/>not given over helping
                            them and are now willing to<br/>accept your offer, the ground of our
                            accepting your offer<pb facs="BYM_Page_122" n="122"></pb><br/>is, that we believe as you are a
                            progressing<br/>people, and mention the name of God in your<br/>offer,
                            you will not act the Hypocrite and deceive<br/>us</p>
<p>Brethren!<br/>We desire you to do your best, we<br/>have chosen our
                            father that is here present to<br/>write this speech and take it on to
                            some of<br/>the Quakers</p>
<p>Brethren!<br/>We believe he will take it safe<br/>you know the custom, in
                            taking speeches from<br/>the <del>Quaker</del> chiefs, that satisfaction
                            should be<br/>given, we desire you to do it—you say you<br/>count us as
                            dear own brethren, we do not think<br/>you will take it hard in paying
                            our father for<br/>his labour in carrying it</p>

<p>It being evident that the views of Friends<br/>towards their Nations have been
                    greatly misre-<br/>presented, and no such letter as they appear to<br/>have
                    received ever having been addressed to them<br/>by us, their communication is
                    refered to the sub-<br/>Committee who are directed to write them a<br/>suitable
                    reply to it</p>
<p>A letter was received from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>
                        dated<br/><date when="1805-10-04">10 Mo 4 1805</date>—in which he says <said who="well1">Agreeably to the<br/>directions of the committee, I have
                        employed a man<br/>to assit the Indians in cultivating the field on

                        year, the Indians with this mans<br/>assistance have raised, it is supposed
                        at least 600<br/>bushels of good corn, from this one field exclu-<br/>sive
                        of what they have raised from ground of<br/>their own clearing</said></p>

<p>He adds <said who="wwell1">believing as I do that the Society of<br/>Friends are

                        Country, I will take<br/>the liberty to observe that the present is a
                        very<br/>favourable time, to put in execution, their be-<br/>nevolent views
                        towards the distressed Natives of<br/>this land and that much good may be

                        them<br/>the last year, at a station where he had every<br/>thing to begin,
                        there are now at least 400 Hogs<br/>and 20 Cows, and the Indians at no
                        village in<br/>this Country live so comfortably as those at<br/>that place.
                        If this spirit of industry is kept<br/>alive for a few years it will
                        certainly have a<br/>powerful influence on the minds of the Indians<br/>at
                        many of the neighboring Villages. The<br/>Indians have lately, concluded a
                        treaty with<br/>the United States which has setled all their<br/>jarring
                        interests</said></p>
<p>After a solid consideration of the subject<br/>the sub-committee were directed to
                    endeavour to<br/>engage one or two suitable characters to go our<br/>and remain
                    the succeeding summer with the<br/>Indians for the purpose of instructing them

<p>Brothers!<br/>We are sorry to perceive by this speech<br/>that our
                            intentions towards you have been greatly<br/>misrepresented—we suppose
                            the interpreters between<br/>us did not understand our language
                            suffice-<br/>ently well to explain to you our meaning<br/>as we have not
                            written any letter conveying to you the<br/>offers you mention, nor has
                            any person authorized<br/>by us, ever held out any such proposals,
                            as<br/>you appear to think you have received—the only<br/>letter we ever
                            wrote to you, we herewith send you<br/>an exact copy of, by reading of
                            it you will see<br/>the reasons why we have not given you more
                            assis-<br/>tance</p>
<p>Brothers!<br/>The misrepresentations which have<pb facs="BYM_Page_126" n="126"></pb><br/>been
                            made to you, renders it necessary for<br/>us, at this time, to explain
                            our views and pros-<br/>pects at large towards you, that may not
                            any<br/>longer be deceived, or hereafter suppose, we have<br/>held out
                            any expectations to you, which it<br/>was not our intention to have
                            realized</p>
<p>Brothers!<br/>About Ten years ago when many of<br/>your brethren the
                            Quakers, were assembled in their<br/>great council to transact the
                            affairs of their<br/>society we believed that the great Spirit
                            put<br/>it into our hearts to endeavour to do something<br/>towards the
                            assistance of our Indian Brethren<br/>who we believed suffered much for
                            the want of<br/>food and cloathing by not knowing how to
                            cultivate<br/>their lands and make cloathes for themselves as<br/>the
                            white people do, we therefore appointed some<br/>of our brethren to take
                            such of our red brothers by<br/>the hand as would be willing to be
                            instructed<br/>by us in the use of the Plow, the Hoe and other<br/>Tools
                            employed by us in raising corn and other grain</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>These of our brethren soon after bean<br/>to look round and
                            see which of the Indian Nations<br/>would be most likely to be willing
                            to receive<br/>instruction from us, we had not at that time<br/>any
                            particular prospects exclusively towards any<br/>Tribe or nation, we
                            felt them all as brethren<pb facs="BYM_Page_127" n="127"></pb><br/>whom we loved, and were
                            disposed to assist as far<br/>as our power extended either of them whom
                            we<br/>might find willing to accept of our aid</p>
<p>Brothers!<br/>After having visited several Indian<br/>families of the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> Nations<br/>and informed them of our intentions,
                            we received<br/>about 7 years ago a speech from our brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhic<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a><br/>delivered at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> on behalf of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a><br/>and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> Nations in which we were invited<br/>to attend
                            at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San Dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> the next summer
                            and<br/>talk together on the subject of assisting you</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Seven of us accordingly at the time ap-<br/>pointed made a
                            visit to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San Dusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> and in
                            a<br/>Council which they then had with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhic<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> at his<br/>own house, with two other chiefs and
                            many hun-<br/>ters, we told you that it had arrisen in our<br/>hearts,
                            to try and afford you some assistance in<br/>teaching you how to
                            cultivate your lands &amp; make<br/>clothing, in reply our brother
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhic<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> informed us<br/>on behalf of
                            himself and the other chiefs present<br/>that they could not give us any
                            answer at that<br/>time, but would in a general council of
                            their<br/>chiefs and people consult together and send a<br/>written
                            answer to us as soon as you came to a<br/>conclusion amongst
                            yourselves</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_128" n="128"></pb>
<p>Brothers<br/>We have never since that time<br/>until now received any
                            direct communication<br/>from you—after having waited three years<br/>
                            we were discouraged and thought you had<br/>declined accepting any
                            assistance from us<br/>therefore turned our attention towards
                            some<br/>other Nations, who we knew were willing &amp;<br/>anxious to
                            receive help from us</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Having now entered into engagements<br/>with our brothers
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and some others<br/>it is not
                            in our power to extend much aid<br/>to you at this time, we have not the
                            means<br/>of giving a great deal, and having promoted<br/>a settlement
                            on the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">Wabash river<placename key="wabas"></placename></a> of such
                            of<br/>our Red Brethren as were willing to be ins-<br/>ructed by us in
                            agriculture we feel ourselves<br/>engaged to give them further
                            assistance—we<br/>hope they will before a great while, by
                            industry<br/>and care learn to do without much of our<br/>help, as their
                            father the President of the United<br/>States and the Secretary of War
                            we know are<br/>disposed to render these and the whole of
                            their<br/>other Red Children all the assistance in their<br/>power, in
                            making their situations more comforta-<br/>ble, and we hope the support
                            they will<br/>continue to receive from them will release us<pb facs="BYM_Page_129" n="129"></pb><br/>from the necessity of furnishing our aid at that<br/>place much
                            longer</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>Should this be the case and our<br/>brethren of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> at upper <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">SanDusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> continue disposed to receive
                            help from<br/>us we will probably hereafter turn our attention<br/>more
                            towards relieving them, for we still con-<br/>tinue to feel as much love
                            for them as when we<br/>first offered them our aid and have only
                            been<br/>prevented from helping them, by not having<br/>heard from them
                            before now, which made us<br/>suppose they did not wish it</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We have concluded to request our<br/>friend <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cjewi1">Charles Jewitt<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a> Indian Agent at
                            Detroit<br/>to furnish you with 2 setts of Plow Irons 12 Axes

                            of our love for you these we hope<br/>you will receive, and put them
                            into the hands of<br/>such of our Red Brethren of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyadot">Wyandot Nation<orgname key="wyadot"></orgname></a><br/>as will be willing to use

<p>In the latter end of last Month I<br/>had the honor to receive a packet
                            from the<br/>Secretary at War, enclosing your address to
                                the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot Indians<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and your

                            directed me to<br/>do the same with your address and letter as <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cjewi1">C.Jewitt<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a> would have done, if he had
                            been here, who<br/>is in the public service as Indian Agent

                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/magua">Maguaga<placename key="magua"></placename></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/browt">Browns Town<placename key="browt"></placename></a> who<br/>are often here. The most
                            considerable and res-<br/>pectable part of that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> live in those two<br/>Villages, where also resides
                            the public Interpreter for<br/>that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>. I have conferred with this Inter-<br/>preter and
                            these Chiefs, who rejoice in the con-<pb facs="BYM_Page_135" n="135"></pb><br/>contemplation of
                            your goodness and kind thoughts<br/>towards the Indians and would gladly
                            accept of your<br/>profered aid. But I have doubts whether it
                            would<br/>meet your purpose to bestow the bounty you mention<br/>on this
                            part of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>,
                            inasmuch<br/>as your address is directed to those at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">San Duskey<placename key="sandu"></placename></a><br/>I should be glad of
                            information from you on<br/>this point. Give me leave to inform you,
                            that<br/>those <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> of the two
                            Villages before mentioned<br/>are a very deserving people, temperate,
                            sober, reli-<br/>gious in their way and have already
                            become<br/>agriculterists in part, but need aid and encoura-<br/>gement,
                            with which I have no doubt they would soon<br/>quit the hunting life
                            altogether, and advance ra-<br/>pidly to a state of compleat
                            civilization. Indeed<br/>from what I have seen in this people I am
                            greatly<br/>confirmed in a favourite opinion long entertained<br/>by me,
                            that the Indians are capable of becoming<br/>as well civilized as any
                            people in the world. The<br/>Indians now in question are very anxious to
                            make<br/>further advanced in agriculture and knowledge<br/>and have
                            repeatedly signified to me their ardent<br/>wish for a few good farmers
                            to come amongst them<br/>also some mechanicks, particularly a
                            blacksmith<br/>--As these Indians have frequent communications<br/>with
                            their brethren at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sanduskey<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> I thought
                            proper<br/>to deliver your address to their Interpreter desiring him<pb facs="BYM_Page_136" n="136"></pb><br/>to commit it to faithful Men to carry
                                to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sanduskey<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> where there are
                            persons (particularly <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/iwill2">IsaacWilliams<persname key="iwill2"></persname></a> a half blooded <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> who has an<br/>excellent education) capable of
                            reading and<br/>explaining it to the chiefs there or if the
                            Inter-<br/>preter should himself see any of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a><br/>chiefs, I desired him to explain it to
                            them; and<br/>told him to return the orriginal to me, with<br/>an answer
                            from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sandu">Sanduskey<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> chiefs as soon
                            as<br/>possible, all which he promised to do. When I<br/>receive an
                            answer it will be communicated<br/>to you without delay</p>
<p>As Cash is excessively scarce in this country &amp;<br/>Credit cannot be
                            obtained but for a few days<br/>especially on Iron Work, I shall find it
                            necessary to<br/>advance the Cash, if I should order the utensils
                            to<br/>be made which are mentioned in your address.<br/>Besides, the
                            mode of remiting payments to this place<br/>in cash per mail is subject
                            to great delays and<br/>risques. I would therefore suggest to you, the
                            pro-<br/>priety of either drawing yourselves on some<br/>friend here who
                            would be accommodated by a<br/>payment in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, or apply to the Secretary<br/>of the United
                            States Treasury for a draft on the<br/>collector of this district. You
                            will know what sum<br/>of money you can spare to devote to this object,
                            &amp;<br/>if committed to me it shall be faithfully applied
                            &amp;<br/>accounted for to you<pb facs="BYM_Page_137" n="137"></pb>
<br/>Friends! I approve greatly of your charitable <br/>intentions
                            towards the Indians, and applaud your <br/>benevolent and disinterested
                            exertions to civilize <br/>them. ALl to whom I have mentioned the
                            <br/>contents and letter express great satisfaction in <br/>the same. It
                            is particularly wished that the <br/>friends might obtain a footing and
                            an influence <br/>amongst the Indians, as their precepts and exam-
                            <br/>ples are powerfully, pointed against the <br/>characteristic and
                            predominent Indian vices — <br/>idleness — intemperence — and war</p>
<p> Of all Christian denominations you appear <br/>to understand the right
                            method of accomplishing <br/>the object long wished for and sought by
                            pious <br/>people towards the Indians and are going the right <br/>way
                            to work, for it is an indubitable truth that <br/>they must be civilized
                            by Agriculture &amp;c. before they <br/>can be efficiently benefited in
                            their religion <br/>or morals — I have a plan in my mind which <br/>I
                            have long cherished, and am the more convinced <br/>in its eligibility
                            since I have had an opportunity <br/>to become acquainted with the
                            Indians in this <br/>Country — extending perhaps a little beyond what
                            you <br/>may have contemplated, but substantially founded <br/>on the
                            same principles, but which you appear to be <br/>governed in your
                            efforts towards them, I will <br/>take the liberty to make it known to
                            you soon requesting <pb facs="BYM_Page_138" n="138"></pb>
<br/>Your consideration of and Interest in its favour<br/>should it meet
                            with your approbation. I am also<br/>collecting materials for a history
                            of all this part<br/>of the Country, particularly of the Indians, and
                            <br/>of its natural productions &amp;c.</p>

<p>I committed your address (as was mentioned<br/>in my former letter) to
                            the interpreter and the<br/>principal chief of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/mogua">Moguago<placename key="mogua"></placename></a> to<br/>be communicated and explained to the

                            lately waited on me<br/>with the following information-</p>
<p>That they dispatched two young men<br/> with the address to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tarh1">Tarhie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sand">Sanduskey<placename key="sand"></placename></a> who<br/>were gone 7 days- that they found him
                            with<br/>other chiefs and many more people assembled at a <br/>funeral-
                            that a missionary preacher was there<br/>whose name they had forgot-
                            that on making known<br/>their errand and producing the address the
                            preacher<br/>interfered and strongly urged the chiefs and people<br/>not
                            to hearken to the Quakers nor accept any<br/>thing from them, not even
                            the implements of<br/>Husbandry offered by you as a present- that if<pb facs="BYM_Page_139" n="139"></pb><br/>they wanted such things he (the preacher) made
                            no<br/>doubt the missionary society in whose service he<br/>was employed
                            would furnish them with what they<br/>wanted- and- that they could get
                            no particular<br/>answer from the chiefs at that time. But, it
                            is<br/>possible either you or I may hear from them<br/>by and by</p>
<p>Who this preacher is, I know not. But who<br/>ever he may be, I am sure
                            he ought never to<br/>have been sent to the Indians, to act so
                            much<br/>like a heathen himself, so contrary to the Gospel<br/>of peace,
                            and to the interests of the poor nations &amp;<br/>of the U.S and of us
                            all who reside near the<br/>savages- The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/misscon">Missionary Society of Connecticut<orgname key="misscon"></orgname></a><br/>have had preachers
                            in that quarter, but whether<br/>he belonged to that or an other
                            society, is uncertain<br/>I should hope better of my nation state, than
                            that<br/>they would employ such men for christian<br/>teachers- I hope
                            the clergy of New England are<br/>not for Renewing the spirit of former
                            times aga<br/>inst the Quakers- too much cannot be done for<br/>the
                            improvement of the Indians, and if that, or<br/>any other society, would
                            share them assistance in<br/> the line offered by you, they certainly
                            could do it<br/>and still suffer the poor Indians to receive
                            the<br/>benefit of yours- the Natives in question are ripe<br/>for
                            exchanging the savage life for civilization, &amp;<br/>are very desirous
                            to obtain ploughs, hoes &amp; which you<pb facs="BYM_Page_140" n="140"></pb><br/>offer- those in

                            these things<br/>from the U.S- From the concern taken by

<p>The committee again met, when<br/>the friends appointed produced the following
                    report</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<note resp="transc">This report is tipped-in</note>
<opener>TO THE<br/>YEARLY MEETING, <br/>NOW SITTING.</opener>
<p>We, the Committee on Indian Concerns, inform, that since our<br/>last
                            report we have, agreeably to the liberty given us, published
                            <br/>narrative of our proceedings, which has been distributed
                            amongst<br/>Friends. We further inform, that a letter has been received
                            from<br/>the Indian agent at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, dated <date when="1805-10-05">the Fifth of
                                the Tenth<br/>month, 1805</date>, in which he says, <br/>Agreeably
                            to the directions of the Committee, I have employ-<br/>ed a man to
                            assist the Indians in cultivating the field on the <geogname key="wabas">Wa-<br/>bash</geogname>, which was cleared and cultivated by
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> last<br/>year. The
                            Indians, with this man’s assistance, have raised, it is<br/>supposed, at
                            least six-hundred bushels of good Corn from this<br/>field, exclusive of
                            what they have raised from the ground of their own<br/>clearing. Many of
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eel River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> Indians have removed<br/>and settled at that place,
                            where they will be followed by the<br/>younger branches of their tribes
                            in the ensuing spring.</p>
<p>He adds, <said who="undetermined">Believing as I do, that the Society of
                                Friends are<br/>desirous of ameliorating the situation of their red
                                brethren in this<br/>country, I will take the liberty to observe,
                                that the present is a<br/>very favourable time to put in execution,
                                their benevolent views,<br/>and that much good may be done on the
                                    <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> by sending one<br/>or
                                two suitable men to reside amongst the Indians, in order
                                to<br/>teach them how to raise stock and cultivate the earth:
                                Witness<br/>what <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
                                effected amongst them the last year. At a<br/>Station where he had
                                every thing to begin, there are now at<br/>least four hundred Hogs
                                and twenty Cows, and at no village in<br/>this country, do the
                                Indians live as comfortably as at that place.<br/>If this spirit of
                                industry is kept alive for a few years, it will cer-<br/>tainly have
                                a powerful influence upon the minds of the Indians, at<br/>many of
                                the neighboring villages.</said></p>
<p>The Committee, after deliberate consideration, were united in
                            senti-<br/>ment, that it would be proper to procure one or two young men
                            to re-<br/>side among the Indians at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis’s
                                Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a>
                            and his bro-<br/>ther <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> were
                            accordingly engaged, who arrived at the station on<br/>the <date when="1806-04-25">25th of the Fourth Month last</date>. William has
                            just returned, having<br/>left his brother among the Indians, and has
                            given us the following in-<br/>formation: That they had planted twelve
                            acres of Indian corn, <br/>on the land already cleared; after which they
                            enclosed eight acres<br/>more; in six of which they cultivated Potatoes,
                            Hemp, Flax,<br/>Tobacco and Timothy, together with a variety of Garden
                            Vege-<br/>tables; that their crop of Corn, was likely to produce, at
                            least fif-<br/>ty bushels per acre; and that they should have one
                            hundred bush-<br/>els of Potatoes, and many more Garden Vegetables than
                            would be<br/>sufficient for their own use, which would be distributed
                            amongst<br/>the Indians; they have also erected a stable, 16 by 18 feet,
                            and<br/>assisted the Indians in building three houses. He further
                            informs,<pb facs="BYM_Page_142" n="142"></pb><br/>that half a mile below the Station, is a
                            village, where they found<br/>fourteen families of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/eel">Eel River Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a>, which has this
                            summer,<br/>been increased by several families and many more are
                            expected<br/>this fall; That these Indians have raised a good crop of
                            Corn, and<br/>have several Horses, Cows, and many Hogs. Another village
                            of<br/>twenty families, of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, is
                            settled about a half mile above<br/>the Station. These have also raised
                            a good crop of Corn, and<br/>have several Horses and Cattle, and at
                            least on hundred Hogs.<br/>At both of those villages their Corn was
                            planted by white people,<br/>employed by the Indian agent, who, with
                            their consent, deducts the<br/>expence out of their annuities. After the
                            Corn was planted, they<br/>cultivated themselves.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>, several
                            families of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wea">Weas Indians<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> are<br/>settled,
                            who have cleared six acres of land. The family with<br/>which <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> resided, being one of them.
                            This six acres,<br/>together with part of what Philip Dennis cleared,
                            which was not<br/>cultivated by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon
                                Kirk<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a>, they have themselves cul-<br/>tivated in Corn,
                            except one plowing given it by William Kirk.<br/>From this ground
                            William expects they will have from sixty to<br/>seventy bushels per
                            acre. The young Indian who worked with<br/>Philip Dennis, has a good
                            sock of Cattle, and about four hundred<br/>hogs.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> further observes, that he
                            visited several of the Indian<br/>villages in that country, the Indians,
                            at most of which, were anxious<br/>to engage in the cultivation of their
                            lands, and very solicitous<br/>that aid should be extended to them by
                            Friends; but he uniform-<br/>ly replied to them that Friends had it not
                            in their power to aid<br/>more settlements than the one at present under
                            their care. He<br/>also informs, that the progress made by the Indians
                            in civilization<br/>surpasses any thing that could have been expected in
                            so short a<br/>time. There are, nevertheless, many amongst them, who
                            have no<br/>disposition to labour.</p>
<p>The Indian agent and all the other officers of government, have<br/>been
                            very kind, and have done all in their power to make their
                            situa-<br/>tion comfortable. The young Indian who distinguished himself
                            by<br/> working with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>,
                            gave them twenty Bushels of Corn and<br/>some Hogs in return for the
                            benefits received from the Friends last year.<br/>Some of almost all the
                            tribes residing within sixty miles of the sta-<br/>tion, have visited
                            them; these, and all the other Indians in the neigh-<br/>bourhood have
                            been very friendly and well disposed. He further<br/>says, that he
                            delivered the address from the committee, directed<br/>by him to the
                            principal Chiefs of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and
                            others; in an-<br/>swer to which, a reply was received from the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, on behalf<br/>of
                            his own tribe, from which the following is an extract.</p>

                                        Friends,</salute></opener>
<p>The words which you spoke to me and my brother chiefs,
                                    who<br/>accompanied me to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> some years ago, are yet fresh in
                                    my<br/>memory, and also in the memory of your red brethren in
                                    this<br/>country; for hen I returned home I explained faithfully
                                    to them<br/>all that you requested.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>All you have said to us at and since that period,
                                    has been com-<br/>municated to your red brothers of this
                                    country, which has caused<br/>them to believe that you are their
                                    friends, and wish to relieve them<br/>as far as lays in your
                                    power.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>Two springs ago you made your appearance here
                                    amongst us, <br/>and said it pleased the Great Spirit that you
                                    should visit us;<br/>which visit is gratefully acknowledged by
                                    your red brethren in this<br/>country.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You told us at that time you came to give us all
                                    the assistance<br/>in your power, and requested us to point out
                                    a place where we<br/>thought your services would be of most
                                    benefit to us; we request-<br/>ed you to go to the place where
                                    our friend <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a>, who
                                    is<br/>now present, has resided this summer; this place we chose
                                    be-<br/>cause it was the most public, and would afford
                                    passengers an op-<br/>portunity of seeing what was done more
                                    than any other we could<br/>point out. You then raised a great
                                    crop of Corn and gave it to<br/>your red brethren; the receipt
                                    of which was thankfully acknow-<br/>ledged by them.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You have now again made your appearance amongst
                                    your red<br/>brethren in this country; they have listened to
                                    your words with<br/>attention, and find they correspond with the
                                    first words you spoke<br/>to us. You told us you came to occupy
                                    the same ground that you<br/>had occupied two years ago, but did
                                    not request us to point out<br/>to you at what place your
                                    services would be most beneficial, as<br/>you did when you first
                                    arrived amongst us, which has prevented<br/>your red brethren,
                                    residing elsewhere, from participating in your services</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_143" n="143"></pb>
<p>Brothers, <br/>We believe your intentions towards your red
                                    brethren<br/>are good, for which we are thankful to you; we hope
                                    that<br/>the Great Spirit will continue it in your hearts, to
                                    relieve<br/>your red brethren, who are at this time much in want
                                    of your<br/>aid.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We received with pleasure the implements of
                                    husbandry<br/> you sent us; we have endeavoured to use them but
                                    we have not<br/> been able to make right use of them, for want
                                    of some person<br/>to teach us how they are used.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You are come amongst us as it were this morning,
                                    the sun has<br/>not yet risen to 12 o’clock; you have not stayed
                                    all night with us.<br/>The families you have visited amongst us,
                                    are well pleased with<br/>you, and confidently receive you as
                                    their brothers: we therefore,<br/>hope you will continue amongst
                                    us, as we believe our attachment<br/>will increase with the time
                                    you are with us.</p>

<p>The committee have lately received another letter from<br/>the Indian
                            agent, in which he says <said who="undetermined">that the Indians<br/>at
                                    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis’s Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>, as well as
                                those at the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/lturtown">Little Turtle’s
                                    Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a>,<br/>eighteen miles north of Dennis’s Station,
                                are advancing towards<br/>civilization, exceeding all that could
                                have been expected.</said></p>
<p>We have examined the treasurer’s accompts, and find in his hands<br/>219
                            dollars and 41 cents.<br/>The committee, in concluding their report, are
                            free to observe,<br/>that upon a review of the progress made towards the
                            accomplish-<br/>ment of the object of their appointment, there appears
                            to be great<br/>cause of encouragement for Friends to persevere in this
                            truly lauda-<br/>ble and interesting concern, which has prospered,
                            beyond the expec-<br/>tations of Friends, at the time they first engaged
                            in the undertak-<br/>ing: and clearly demonstrates to the discerning
                            mind, that it<br/>hath indeed been divinely owned; and no discouragement
                            or ob-<br/>straction now appearing, but the want of funds, the
                            committee<br/>affectionately address themselves to the feelings of
                            Friends. They<br/>deem it not improper to remind them that the soil,
                            from which,<br/>through the mercy and goodness of Divine Providence, we
                            derive<br/>so many comforts and blessings, was once the inheritance of
                            this<br/>people. A small part of the abundance with which we are
                            blessed<br/>would, if rightly applied at the present time, be the means
                            of ad-<br/>ministering great comfort and advantage to them; and it is
                            all-<br/>important, that the present favourable crisis should be
                            improved:<br/>for if an opinion were to obtain amongst them, that
                            Friends are<br/>withdrawing their aid, they may become discouraged, and
                            return<br/>to their former mode of living for support, and thereby
                            again<br/>become plunged into that poverty and wretchedness, from
                            which,<br/>by the aid of the Friends, they are just emerging. The
                            committee,<br/>therefore fell themselves warranted in saying, that they
                            believe, the<br/>very existence of nations may depend upon the part we
                            now act in<br/>this business; they also consider, that the reputation of
                            society is<br/>deeply interested in the active prosecution of the
                            concern; and<br/>feel an earnest desire, that if the meeting should see
                            it right to<br/>continue them, Friends may be stimulated to more
                            liberality, as it<br/>is altogether impracticable for the committee to
                            continue their ex-<br/>ertions without the aid of additional funds. </p>

<p>At a Meeting of the committee on Indian<br/>concerns present 16 Members</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> having been taken into
                    the<br/>employ of the United States, and expressed a prospect<br/>of removing
                    his brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon Kirk<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> to one of<br/>the
                    stations placed under his care by the Govern<br/>ment; The sub committee
                    informed that they<br/>had written to those of our members residing
                        at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>, giving this information
                    to them; And<br/>had requested their assistance in procuring<br/>suitable
                    persons to succeed William &amp;Mahlon<br/>at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis

                    them.</p>
<p>The committee having taken the subject<br/>into consideration concluded it would
                    be<br/>best, under the present state of things to con<br/>tinue our exertions to
                    procure a well quali<br/>fied person to take charge of our settlement<br/>on the
                        <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> but if no such can be
                    attained<br/>the sub committee were directed to write to Wm.<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> and desire him to employ a man to
                    assist<br/>the Indians on behalf of Friends in puting in<br/>their crop the
                    ensueing season and inform them that the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tjeff2">Presidentof
                        the United States<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a>, having employed the persons<br/>which we had
                    sent out to aid them, and no one<br/>having offered to succeed them we had
                    adopted this<pb facs="BYM_Page_145" n="145"></pb><br/>measure as the best at the present time in<br/>our
                    power to be useful to them, and at the<br/>same time assure the Indians of the
                    continu<br/>ance of our friendship and regard</p>
<p>The sub committee were also directed to<br/>write to our Members over the
                    mountains &amp;<br/>inform them that it was the opinion of Friends<br/>here it
                    would not be proper to employ a<br/>woman the next season at our station
                    on<br/>the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, and that as no suitable
                    individual<br/>was likely to offer here we requested them<br/>to continue their
                    exertions to obtain if possible<br/>one on that side of the mountains the
                    sub<br/>committee were also directed to inform <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">Wm
                        Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a><br/>that we considered <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> as released from<br/>our service</p>
<p>Under a solid consideration of the very<br/>important change committed to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> &amp;<br/>the great

                            thereof likely to become vacant<br/>we some time past requested your aid
                            in procuring<br/>if possible a suitable man and his wife to take
                            charge<br/>of this attention- Since which time a general Meet<br/>ing of
                            the committee has been held and if appeared<br/> to be the prevailing
                            sentiment, that it would be<br/>premature to send a woman there at this
                            time,<br/>we therefore request if you should not already
                            have<br/>contracted with one that you would decline the<br/>prospect of
                            engaging any other than one man<br/>for the next season</p>
<p>It appearing to the committee to be very<br/>important that an individual
                            should be engaged<br/>so as to take charge of it by the time, or
                            soon<br/>after <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> withdraws, we

                            will<br/>without delay communicate to us, your prospect of<pb facs="BYM_Page_147" n="147"></pb><br/>succeeding, as we shall if you are not likely to obtain<br/>one
                            on the other side of the mountains exert our<br/>selves here, it would
                            however be very desirable <br/>that you could succeed there on account

<p>It will no doubt occur to you that a person<br/>a little advanced in life
                            would be prefered by the<br/>committee if such a one could be found
                            and<br/>as an encouragment to those who may fell drawn<br/>to engage in

<p>The committee on Indian<br/>concerns had a Meeting last evening which
                            was<br/>generally attended and have concluded that as thee<br/>is now in
                            the employ of Government, thy brother<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> may be serviceable to thee in thy
                            new<br/>situation in that Country, they have therefore<br/>concluded to
                            leave thee at liberty to take him<br/>in thy employ on thy arrival
                            there</p>
<p>The committee some time since requested<br/>those of their members
                            residing over the moun<br/>tains to procure a suitable man &amp; his
                            wife to<br/>reside at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis’ Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>
                            since when they have<br/>received no reply, but they have now
                            concluded<br/>that it would be premature to send a woman<br/>at this
                            time, and have requested them to procure<br/>a man only, if they should
                            not succeed, nor we be<br/>able to succeed here, we shall then endeavour
                            to<br/>get <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> to procure some
                            person or persons to<br/>manage the business in the same manner it
                            was<br/>done before thee went into that country but if<br/>they should
                            succeed in obtaining a person to reside<br/>at Dennis Station we hope
                            thee will render any<br/>service or advice that may be convenient<pb facs="BYM_Page_149" n="149"></pb></p>
<p>Thee will please to forward <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlons<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a>
                            account as<br/>soon as possible after thy arrival, and as we
                            have<br/>paid a draft drawn by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm

                            from Mahlon, thee<br/>will please to give un information on that
                            subject<br/>also</p>
<p>If thee can find use for the two Horses at<br/>the Station thee may take
                            them and the farming<br/>utensils belonging to the committee under
                            thy<br/>charge, until further advised or until some <br/>other person
                            arrives to take them, but if that<br/>is not convenient, please to
                            deliver them to <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a></p>
<p>The committee would be glad to hear<br/>what distribution was made of the
                            last years<br/>crop- How many Hogs there are belonging to<br/>Friends,
                            and the general state of things at the<br/>settlement when <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mkirk1">Mahlon<persname key="mkirk1"></persname></a> withdraws from it</p>

<salute>Dear friend</salute></opener>
<p>The committee of<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> Yearly
                            Meeting on Indian concerns<br/>being informed that the Government has
                            em<br/>ployed thee to superintend a plan which it<br/>has adopted to
                            promote the civilization of<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>
                            confederacy of Indians and<br/>others, feel their minds impressed with
                            an<br/>anxious solicitude for thy preservation in<br/>the new and
                            exposed situation which thou<br/>will be placed. And under the influence
                            of<br/>an ardent desire that the very important<br/>trusts confided to
                            thee, may through divine<br/>aid be so conducted, as to promote
                            the<br/>laudable views of our Government, &amp; secure<br/>the Benefits
                            intended to this heretofore much<br/>neglected people, the committee
                            feel themselves<br/>in brotherly affection drawn to extend
                            such<br/>admonition and caution as they may be ena<br/>bled to give
                            thee-</p>
<p>on the prudent management of the<br/>charge now committed to thee,
                            circumstances<br/>of very great importance to our Country will<br/>rest,
                            perhaps indeed the existence of whole<br/>nations of those people who
                            are to become<pb facs="BYM_Page_151" n="151"></pb><br/>the objects of thy care, may depend upon
                            the<br/>effect produced, by the present liberal and<br/>christian effort
                            to civilize them;- for should<br/>this attempt not succeed, the failure
                            may be<br/>discouraging not only to the Government but<br/>to the
                            Indians themselves, and they turn their<br/>attention altogether from
                            the cultivation<br/>of their lands- Should this be the case,
                            &amp;<br/>the Indians continue in their present wandering<br/>habits,
                            and disposition of mind, it must inevitably<br/>lead, to the entire
                            annihilation of their race<br/>in a few centuries: Whilst on the other
                            hand<br/>the committee entertain no doubt, but a judi<br/>cious
                            administration of the powers with<br/>which thou art entrusted, would in
                            a little<br/>time draw their attention from their present<br/>mode of
                            living, and fix them in habits,<br/>which would not only secure to them
                            all<br/>the necessary comforts, but be the means of<br/>perpetuating
                            their existence as a people, and<br/>securing their attachment to the
                            Govern<br/>ment of the United States. Under this<br/>consideration of
                            the subject, the committee<br/>have been led to view thy situation as
                            a<br/>highly responsible and important one,<br/>the great confidence
                            reposed in thee has<pb facs="BYM_Page_152" n="152"></pb><br/>certainly a strong claim upon thy
                            utmost<br/>zeal, and the committee earnestly hope, that<br/>the
                            philanthropic views of the government<br/>will not be frustrated, by any
                            want of an<br/>active, faithful and concientious discharge<br/>of thy
                            duty</p>
<p>At this distance from the scene<br/>of thy labours, it cannot be expected
                            that<br/>the committee should enter into a minute<br/>detail of the
                            course it would be proper for<br/>thee to pursue, but there are certain
                            general<br/>principles which obviously &amp; indispensably<br/>should
                            pervade all the operations: In the<br/>first place and above all things,
                            the com<br/>mittee affectionately exhort thee to a frequent<br/>and
                            humble recurence, to that divine and<br/>preserving power which the
                            great Lord and<br/>Master has declared is sufficient for us, and under
                            the<br/>influence of which, if we steadily &amp;faithfully<br/>abide, we
                            may safely travel along through<br/>every difficulty and every trial</p>
<p>The Government manifests a <br/>disinterested, liberal and benevolent
                            policy<br/>toward the Indians, and the committee<br/>strongly desire
                            that the same disinterestedness <br/>may be manifested by thee and that
                            thou<br/>mayest in all thy movements be preserved<br/>from any views of
                            pecuniary emolument <pb facs="BYM_Page_153" n="153"></pb><br/>beyond the liberal salary allowed
                            thee, being<br/>influenced in thy conduct,<br/>solely by a desire to
                            promote their<br/>comfort and welfare- To relieve the wants<br/>and be
                            instrumental in promoting the comfort of<br/>so many thousands of our
                            fellow creatures<br/>must of itself administer sufficient reward<br/>to
                            a feeling mind. Thou art not uninformed<br/>that much injury and great
                            injustice have been<br/>done these people, the present government
                            of<br/>the United States, shows every disposition to<br/>conduct itself
                            with Humanity and justice<br/>towards them, and we do believe is
                            disposed, to<br/>do every thing in its power to discharge
                            the<br/>obligations due from our country to them-<br/>Thy duty will be
                            faithfully to carry into exe<br/>cution its views</p>
<p>The work unavoidably must be<br/>gradual in its progress
                            early<br/>prejudices and fixed habits are not easily era<br/>dicated,
                            every nation being strongly attached<br/>to the manners and customs of
                            its ancestors<br/>we therefore find that great national changes<br/>have
                            always been effected slowly, and thou<br/>must not expect, that the
                            Indians will gene<br/>rally fall in with thy views until they
                            become<br/>fully convinced, that the change proposed<pb facs="BYM_Page_154" n="154"></pb><br/>will promote their advantage; the committee<br/>therefore advise
                            thee not to undertake too<br/>much at first, but commence thy
                            operations<br/>on a small scale; thou will recollect, that<br/>thy
                            business is not to raise food for the Indi<br/>ans, without being
                            assisted by them, this would<br/>only be to encourage them in idleness,
                            but<br/>the object of thy appointment, is, to teach<br/>them how to
                            provide the necessary comforts<br/>for themselves, which can never be
                            done, but<br/>by their consenting to aid in the cultivation<br/>of their
                            lands, and gradually becoming accus<br/>tomed to labour they will feel
                            the benefits<br/>of it, and in time be altogether drawn<br/>off from a
                            precarious dependence upon<br/>fishing &amp; hunting for a support</p>
<p>It will be most prudent for thee, not<br/>to urge the Indians too much to
                            receive thy<br/>aid, but rather wait to be solicited by them;<br/>in all
                            thy communications with them, thou<br/>shouldest endeavour to impress
                            them with<br/>a just idea, of the friendly disposition of the
                                <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tjeff2">president of the United

                                War<persname key="hdear1"></persname></a> towards them, and it is important that<br/>they
                            should be fully satisfied, the Government in<br/>its present undertaking
                            is actuated solely by a<br/>desire to benefit them, for we apprehend
                            that<br/>the Traders residing amongst them being interested<pb facs="BYM_Page_155" n="155"></pb><br/>in keeping them in their present uncivilized<br/>state will use
                            great efforts to counteract thy<br/>exertions, and will throw every
                            obstacle they<br/>can in the way of any plan that may be adopted<br/>for
                            their civilization, they will also probably<br/>endeavour to persuade
                            the Indians, that the<br/>Government is now influenced by
                            some<br/>interested motive, and if they can no other<br/>way succeed in
                            rendering the present attempt<br/>abortive, will even endeavour to
                            induce<br/>them to abandon their present settlements<br/>and remove
                            further to the westward. And<br/>as these traders by living amongst
                            the<br/>Indians and speaking their language, have<br/>a great influence
                            over them, it will<br/>require much circumspectiom and wisdom in thee
                            to<br/>counteract this influence. Thou must be<br/>cautious in thy
                            communications to them<br/>and very particular in the selection of
                            interpret<br/>ters- We apprehend it will rarely be safe<br/>for thee to
                            make use of a trader for this purpose.</p>
<p>In thy communications with<br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hdear1">Secretary of
                                War<persname key="hdear1"></persname></a> thou shouldest at all<br/>times exhibit a candid and
                            unreserved<br/>view of the state of business under the care<pb facs="BYM_Page_156" n="156"></pb><br/>in as clear and concise a manner as<br/>thou art capable of and
                            in the disburse<br/>ment of the public money observe the
                            strictest<br/>regard to economy and the interests of the<br/>government,
                            keeping thy expenditures by<br/>all means within the amount allowed
                            thee</p>
<p>Every effort should also be used to se<br/>cure the attachment of the
                            Indians and <br/>every alurement held out to induce them<br/>to labour,
                            this will best be effected, by<br/>an examplary, prudent &amp;correct
                            deportment<br/>amongst them</p>
<p>Much will also depend <br/>upon thy selecting suitable persons, to
                            reside<br/>at the intended settlements they should<br/>be men, who would
                            be good examples of<br/>industry and of steady habits, who engage<br/>in
                            the service from principle and not<br/>altogether from pecuniary
                            motives- The<br/>committee consider the plan on which<br/>thou art to
                            act as well calculated to<br/>effect the object desired, and from
                            an<br/>honest discharge of the trust confided to<br/>thee they
                            confidently expect a result, highly<br/>beneficial to the Indians and
                            gratifying<br/>to the friends of humanity<pb facs="BYM_Page_157" n="157"></pb></p>
<p>As a member for the society of friends, whose<br/>appointment to this
                            very important charge<br/>perhaps has its origin in that
                            confidence<br/>which our committee lately placed in<br/>thee, by giving
                            thee the superior tendency<br/>of our station on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, we feel a<br/>strong solicitude, that
                            all thy movements<br/>in the prosecution of the duties of
                            thy<br/>appointment, may be marked with a<br/>corectness and integrity,
                            correspondent<br/>with thy religious professions. That thy<br/>general
                            conduct may evince a regard<br/>to the solemn obligations of
                            uprightness,<br/>intitle thee to the gratitude of the Indians<br/>and
                            the approbation of the government<br/>and finally produce in thy own
                            mind the <br/>enjoyment of that peace , which arrises<br/>from an honest
                            discharge of duty, is the<br/>very affectionate desire of our

                            the concern of Friends for effecting<br/>the civilization of the Indian
                            Natives, &amp;<br/>the introduction of the arts of Husbandry<br/>amongst

<p>our settlement on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>
                            remained<br/>under the care of one of the young men who <br/>were
                            employed by us for the last year, until <br/>early in the 5th month
                            last. It appears by <br/>information from him, that his time
                            was<br/>occupied during the winter in taking care<br/>of the Stock,
                            clearing more ground, and<br/>geting rails to enclose it. He also
                            informed that<br/>the corn &amp;Garden Vegetables which were
                            raised<br/>&amp; not wanted for his own use, had been
                            distributed<br/>amongst such of the Indian families as were

<p>The Government of the United States<pb facs="BYM_Page_163" n="163"></pb><br/>has evidenced a

                            to promote as far as its influence<br/>&amp; ability extended the work
                            of civilization<br/>amongst them. By its assistance some tribes<br/>of
                            the Southern Indians have advanced very<br/>considerably towards
                            civilization &amp; having<br/>with a view to extend the same

                            the the most<br/>useful arts of civil life into their
                            country<br/>engaged a person to superintend it, who, with<br/>the
                            consent of the committee took the<br/>young man at our Station into his
                            employ<br/>it was thereby likely to become vacant, accordingly<br/>the
                            committee engaged two young men members<br/>of our society to take
                            charge of it. They <br/>arrived at Dennis Station early in the 5th
                            Mo.<br/>last and were put in possession of all the<br/>effects belonging
                            to Friends there except 2<br/>Horses which had strayed away but which

                            be<br/>divided amongst friends in America in<br/>aid of the concern for
                            promoting the<br/>civilization of the Indians, and they suggest
                            to<br/>the Yearly Meeting the propriety of investing<br/>the donation of
                            our brethren in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a><br/>in some

                            annual proceeds</p>
<p>It appears by information which has<br/>reached us that many of the
                            Indians inha<br/>biting the country bordering on our <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a><br/>have latterly become extremely
                            unsetled &amp;<br/>disquieted in their minds respecting
                            some<br/>religious controversies, which have been<br/>excited amongst
                            them by one Indian<br/>styling himself as a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tensk1">Prophet<persname key="tensk1"></persname></a> and that in con<br/>sequence thereof great
                            numbers have<br/>collected together &amp; intirely neglected
                            any<br/>kind of attention to agriculture or other<br/>concerns we have
                            not understood that<br/>those residing at our station or
                            <br/>immediately in its neighbourhood have yet<br/>had any concern or
                            taken any part in these<br/>controversies, but should this hereafter
                            un<br/>happily be the case, the committee are <pb facs="BYM_Page_166" n="166"></pb><br/>
                            apprehensive it may for a short time<br/>probably interrupt that
                            progress towards<br/>civilization which has heretofore been
                            so<br/>conspicuous amongst them</p>
<p>The committee are aware that in<br/>the prosecution of this concern
                            difficul<br/>ties and discouragements will most<br/>likely often occur-
                            It is a great &amp;<br/>important work which cannot be<br/>effected but
                            with time, yet they feel strength<br/>end in the belief that as friends
                            endeavour<br/>to abide patiently under the weight of the<br/>concern it
                            will continue to progress &amp;<br/>they humbly trust be finally crowned
                            with<br/>success</p>

                            spend<br/>another season in your Country Argreeably to the
                            request<br/>made by our Red Brothers Through <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">William Welles<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>;<br/>We felt such a desire for you
                            improvement that we <pb facs="BYM_Page_173" n="173"></pb><br/>prevailed on him to spend another
                            season with you</p>
<p>Brothers he comes with no other view but to be of<br/>benefit to our Red
                            Brothers. With no other view<br/>but to encourage you to turn your
                            attention to the<br/>cultivation of your lands in order that you
                            may<br/>be enabled to procure a comfortable support for<br/>yourselves
                            your Women and your Children and<br/>which you find greatly to be
                            prefered to the<br/>precarious subsistence which you have
                            heretofore<br/>received from hunting and fishing.</p>
<p>Brothers our friend has come a long way<br/>to be helpful to you. We hope
                            you will attend to his<br/>advise And will be willing to be instructed
                            by him</p>
<p>If you will attend to his advises, and will turn<br/>your attention to
                            raising stock, and to the cultivation<br/>of your lands, you may in a
                            short time have plenty<br/>for yourselves your Women and Children and
                            become<br/>a happy people.</p>
<p>Brothers we hope your young men will be wil<br/>ling to work themselves.
                            And will also be willing<br/>to let your horses work, for we believe the
                            good<br/>Spirit gave us horses to help cultivate our lands</p>
<p>Brothers we believe the good Spirit placed us here<br/>on Earth to do
                            good, And to be of service to each other,<br/>And it is on this ground
                            alone, we are made willing<br/>to contribute a part of what we have
                            procured by in<br/>dustry, in order to convince our Red Brothers
                            that<br/>they, their Women, And Children would receive a<br/>great
                            benefit, And would be much more happy if they<br/>would fall into our
                            mode of living.</p>
<p>Brothers. Some of you have now made a beginning<br/>and we hope see the
                            advantage resulting from cultiva<br/>ting your lands, We wish you to
                            persevere.<pb facs="BYM_Page_174" n="174"></pb></p>
<p>Brothers remember as we have before said<br/>we want nothing from you for
                            our services. We dont<br/>want any of your lands.<br/>Brothers there is
                            one thing more which we<br/>cannot omit mentioning to you, It is
                            respecting<br/>spiritous liquors. We intreat it of you not to<br/>suffer
                            any of that pernicious article to be brought<br/>into your Towns. For we
                            conceive it to be one of the <br/>greatest evils that ever was
                            introduced into the World</p>
<p>Brothers many of the Red people as well as<br/>the white, have lost their
                            lives by making use of it<br/>It will destroy your health it will
                            destroy your senses<br/>And it will disqualify you doing all good
                            acts</p>
<p>For these reasons Brothers we hope you will<br/>discontinue the use of
                            it</p>
<p>Brothers we expect some of our friends will<br/>be at your Villages this
                            summer for the purpose of<br/>seeing your situation, And giving you good
                            advice,<br/>If you should see them, we hope you will make them<br/>as
                            comfortable as you can</p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> &amp; some other chiefs
                            of<br/>your nation visited our country at which time they<br/>and your

                            had an<br/>opportunity of taking each other by the hands.</p>
<p>Brethren These Chiefs having in the course of their<br/>journey seen how
                            much more comfortably the white<br/>people lived than their Red
                            Brethren, were led to<br/>inquire by what means they might on their
                            return to their<br/>own Country be enabled to procure for their people
                            the<br/>same comforts which they saw in the families here</p>
<p>Brethren Your brothers the quakers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> in<br/>a talk which they then had with them
                            explained to them<br/>the means by which we obtained these things- we
                            told<br/>them that it all came out of the grounds and that it<br/>was by
                            cultivating our lands that we were enabled to got<br/>them</p>
<p>Brothers These chiefs then told us that it was their<br/>wish to obtain
                            for their Women &amp; children the same comforts<br/>and that they would
                            on their return home turn their<br/>attention to the cultivation of
                            their lands and for the<br/>purpose of aiding you we procured and
                            forwarded<br/>to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">fort wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> the next

                            Hoes &amp;</p>
<p>Brothers You afterwards informed us that you had rcd<br/>these implements
                            of Husbandry, and that it was your wish <pb facs="BYM_Page_176" n="176"></pb><br/>to make use of
                            them but that you did not know<br/>how to begin in the cultivation of
                            your lands, and<br/>invited us to send some of our friends into your
                            country<br/>to see your situation, and to give you such
                            instruction<br/>as might be necessary</p>
<p>Brethren In consequence of this request and the<br/>friendship which we
                            had for our Red Brethren we did<br/>in the succeeding summer prevail on
                            some of our friends to make<br/>you a visit and one of them remained
                            with you during<br/>the season, to teach you the use of the tools we
                            take hold <br/>of and put you in a way to provide for yourselves your
                            <br/>women &amp;Children, the many necessaries they were in need of </p>
<p>Brethren It is now several years since we first took<br/>each other by
                            the hands- we have during all this time<br/>been endeavouring to draw
                            your attention to the cultiva<br/>tion of your lands, and have several
                            summons sent<br/>some of our friends to stay with you to give you
                            the<br/>necessary instruction</p>
<p>Brethren when our friends first went into your<br/>country they requested
                            such of your Cheifs as were<br/>present to point out the most suitable
                            place to begin<br/>the improvement these chiefs said it had better be
                            at<br/>neither of their villages and after consulting together
                            fixed<br/>on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> and pointed out
                            a particular spot, which<br/>they wished us to to commence the reasons
                            which they gave<br/>for that being the most proper place was that the
                            river<br/> was navigable and a public road passed by this place<br/>on
                            the bank of it, it was of course the most public spot<br/>they could
                            point out which had equal advantages of<br/>soil and would afford many
                            of your your young men<br/>as they passed by an opportunity of learning
                            from the<br/>example set them, and accordingly the settlement
                            was<br/>commenced and has been continued at that place<br/>ever since:
                            it has been our intention after our Red<br/>brethren who have removed to
                            reside at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis station<placename key="denn"></placename></a><br/>shall
                            have become so advanced as to be able to proceed<br/>without the aid of
                            further instruction from us to<br/>propose to your chiefs to take into
                            consideration if they<br/>wish us to extend assistance to any other
                            place &amp; if they<br/>should conclude to request it leave them at
                            liberty<br/>to propose such other spot as they may prefer.<pb facs="BYM_Page_177" n="177"></pb></p>
<p>Brethren As we have already told you so we again<br/>repeat it, it is
                            only by the cultivation of your lands<br/>and rearing of stock that you
                            can ever raise your<br/>selves from the situation which you have
                            here<br/>tofore been in. the white people find it necessary<br/>to do so
                            in order to get food and cloathing for <br/>themselves.</p>
<p>Brethren There are some amongst us who are<br/>not industrious and will
                            not work these cannot<br/>earn the comforts for themselves which
                            industrious<br/>people do but are often in great distress and
                            poverty<br/>so that we clearly see it is by industry that
                            a<br/>comfortable living must be obtained.</p>
<p>Brethren We believe it right to employ our horses<br/>and oxen in tilling
                            our lands, they are strong and<br/>one of them can do more work in a day
                            than<br/>many men. We believe that the good spirit gave<br/>them to us
                            in order to help us in this way. you ought<br/>therefore if you wish to
                            adopt our mode of living use<br/>your horses &amp; oxen in ploughing and
                            other work which<br/>they can do</p>
<p>Brethren listen we have never felt any sentiment<br/>but friendship for
                            of course are not afraid to speak<br/>to you as brethren who love each
                            other ought to do.<br/>Therefore we now tell you that we believe
                            Whiskey<br/>to be one of the greatest evils which the Bad Spirit<br/>has
                            introduced into the world it brings more misery<br/>&amp; poverty along
                            with it than any other thing that has<br/>ever been found in this
                            Country</p>
<p>Brethren We intreat you not to suffer any of this<br/>Poison to be
                            brought to your towns you have seen the<br/>effect of it and must know
                            its destructive consequences<br/>Whiskey not only corrupts the minds of
                            those that<br/>drink it but also occasions great poverty &amp; distress
                            in<br/>the families of those men who get drunk because it<br/>destroys
                            their reason and disqualifies them for work <pb facs="BYM_Page_178" n="178"></pb><br/>It has
                            this effect upon the white people who drink<br/>it and will have the
                            same effect upon you</p>
<p>Brethren we believe that the good Spirit<br/>placed all men on this earth
                            as brothers and that<br/>it is their duty to do all the good they can to
                            each<br/>other it is altogether on the ground that we are
                            made<br/>willing to contribute a part of what we have obtained<br/>by
                            our industry in order to assist our Red Brothers<br/>it is this that has
                            made us anxious to convince you<br/>that you would be much happier if
                            you would lay<br/>aside your present mode of living and adopt
                            the<br/>more certain and less laborious mode of living by<br/>the
                            cultivation of the earth</p>
<p>Brethren we always told you that in sending<br/>our young men into your
                            country to show you how<br/>to use the tools which your chiefs saw in
                            the Lands<br/>of the white people we did not seek our advantage<br/>we
                            now again give you this assurance and hope<br/>you will be convinced
                            that in doing it never had<br/>any object in view but your own good</p>
<p>Brethren It is our desire that you will keep<br/>this paper which we now
                            send you as a document<br/>in your hands that we have no claim on you
                            or<br/>your children who may come after you for our<br/>services and
                            will never ask any lands or other<br/>rewards from you or
                                them<br/><del><gap></gap> avoid all kinds of Whiskey- By this you will in
                                a few<br/>years find yourselves surrounded by the same<br/>plenty
                                that you saw in the families of the white<br/>people </del></p>

                    amongst<br/>the Indians. Having on their arrival concluded<br/>it would be best
                    to have a general conference<br/>with the Indians at that place, they
                    were<br/>invited to attend in council 10 days from <br/>that time, in the mean
                    time the committee<br/>made a visit to the Indians residing at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a> at which place the
                    Indians<br/>manifested a friendly disposition towards<br/>them. They have found
                    that some of the Indians<br/>had made considerable progress in the
                    cultivation<br/>of their lands by the aid of White Men hired<br/>out of their
                    annuities, and a few of them<br/>by their own labour. But the insatiable
                    desire<br/>these people have for spirituous liquors, and the<br/>quantity they
                    obtain from the state of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a><br/>renders it a
                    matter of doubt in the opinion<br/>of the Committee whether much
                    progress<br/>will be made in civilization whilst it remains <pb facs="BYM_Page_180" n="180"></pb><br/>in
                    their power to possess themselves of that<br/>destructive article. The young men
                    in the<br/>employ of friends at that place were<br/>engaged in preparing for a
                    crop of corn &amp;c.<br/>and appeared to be acting prudently, the<br/>Indians as
                    well as whites in the neighbout<br/>hood expressed satisfaction with their
                    conduct<br/>since their residence amongst them</p>

                            present felt so much love for you that<br/>they were willing to
                            accompany us into you Country<br/>to see how you did &amp; how you were
                            learning to till<br/>the grounds &amp; raise grain &amp; cattle for food
                            for<br/>yourselves your wives &amp; your children.</p>
<p>Brothers, we thank the great spirit for bring<br/>ing us safe to you. we
                            have been at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis’sstation<placename key="denn"></placename></a> on
                            the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> &amp; were glad to see
                            that<br/>some of our red Brethren are likely to do well there<br/>and
                            hope that they &amp; all the rest of our red Brothers <pb facs="BYM_Page_182" n="182"></pb><br/>will get their eyes open so that they may see and<br/>their
                            hearts made good, that they may be willing<br/>to do the things that are
                            best for them.</p>
<p>Brothers we decided to visit several of your towns<br/>but there fell so
                            much rain that the waters<br/>were made high &amp; the roads so bad we
                            thought<br/>we could not come-</p>
<p>Brothers we were very sorry to hear that some<br/>of our red brothers
                            still drink too much Whisky<br/>we wish to persuade you to look at it
                            and see<br/>how much harm it does you, you may be sure<br/>that the man
                            who lets you have it is not your<br/>friend, but your enemy who will
                            cheat you who<br/>will destroy you.</p>
<p>In order Brothers to convince you that what<br/>we say is true we will
                            read to you part of a <br/>talk of one of your Chiefs spoke to the
                            Quakers in<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> a few years
                            ago: the speech was then read.</p>
<p>Brothers we wish you to remember that you<br/>have requested us to show
                            you how to work, we<br/>have sent men for that purpose not merely to
                            work<br/>for you, but to show you how to work for yourselves<br/>If you
                            intend still to endeavour to learn &amp; wish<br/>them to continue to
                            instruct you we want you to<br/>tell us so. If you say you do not desire
                            it we will<br/>take our young men away-</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>This was all they had to say to the Indians until<br/>they received their answer
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/etyso1">Elisha Tyson<persname key="etyso1"></persname></a> rose &amp;<br/>observed that
                    you have heard what your Chiefs<br/>have said some years ago that they had
                    applied<br/>to their father the President of the United States <pb facs="BYM_Page_183" n="183"></pb><br/>for assistance. Your father is rich and is able and<br/>willing to assist
                    you. You have plainly seen he<br/>is willing to assist you he has sent you tools
                    and<br/>his young men into your Country to work for you<br/>&amp; instruct you
                    how to use them. that they came<br/>into your very towns for this purpose. All
                    this was<br/>done at the request of your Chiefs When these young<br/>men came
                    forward you refused to receive them, how<br/>can you expect after this the
                    assistance of your father<br/>let your wants be ever so great. we now want
                    to<br/>know the reason why you have refused to receive<br/>the young men (sent

<said who="fmeda1"><p>Brothers we have heard all you have said<br/>and we
                                thank the great spirit for putting it in<br/>our power to meet this
                                day. we the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Potowatomies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> make one and are satisfied
                                with<br/>what you have said. You see how many of us<br/>are here
                                with you. Our principal Chiefs are not<br/>here now The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> nor the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/massas">Massasiniway<orgname key="massas"></orgname></a>
<br/>Indians are not here. You have asked us questions<br/>which we
                                will endeavor to answer- You have told<br/>us you had a pity on and
                                this has been the uniform<br/>language to us from you since we first
                                knew you<br/>In consequence of what we have said we saw <pb facs="BYM_Page_184" n="184"></pb><br/>the aid of our father last spring at this place<br/>you will
                                now hear the reason why we did<br/>not receive it. I suppose that
                                the man that<br/>was sent here last spring, was sent here for
                                the<br/>purpose of aiding us but as it often happens<br/>that we are
                                all engaged in some business that<br/>we consider of more importance
                                than other business<br/>which was the case when the aid of our
                                father<br/>arrived among us, we had no wish to refuse<br/>the aid of
                                our father- The same cause that<br/>existed last year when our
                                father offered his aid<br/>still exists in consequence of which you
                                do not<br/>now see our chiefs present- We wish you to lay<br/>that
                                aside we have not rejected the aid of our<br/>father and we hope
                                that will be no cause for you<br/>to withdraw your aid from us, you
                                often told us<br/>you loved us &amp; we hope you will continue your
                                aid<br/>towards us &amp; when you see our great father we
                                hope<br/>you will tell him this- Those people that
                                    requested<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">William Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> to
                                withdraw for a time, are not present<br/>&amp; we are sorry for it.
                                I must observe to you that<br/>this is what was said to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkirk1">Wm Kirk<persname key="wkirk1"></persname></a> by the Indians<br/>that met him
                                at this place last spring- he was<br/>asked if he had an address
                                from their father<br/>they did not see his name to any paper, they
                                then<br/>believed that their father had been liberal<br/>towards
                            them that he had appropriated money <pb facs="BYM_Page_185" n="185"></pb><br/>for their use
                                but they had never seen it. I only<br/>give you this information we
                                have given our<br/>father the reason of our rejecting him &amp; we
                                ought<br/>not to be questioned for our reasons at this
                                place-<br/>This is all we shall have to say to you at pres-<br/>ent
                                you see our Chiefs are not present when<br/>they &amp; us have
                                assembled we will communi<br/>cate all you have said to us &amp;
                                they will give<br/>such an answer as they think most
                            proper-</p></said>

<floatingtext type="speech">
<said who="wloon1">
<p>It is with great pleasure that I see that<br/>the hearts of our
                                brothers are disposed to do<br/>us service- I am sorry that the
                                Cheifs are not<br/>present to give such an answer as the
                                question<br/>requires. It is natural for you to expect me to
                                <br/>say something. I will speak of those young men<br/>you have
                                sent from time to time to assist us<br/>at our villages. To meet
                                your views &amp; to give you<br/>a proof that we wish to better our
                                situation<br/>we have taken several annuities and applied<br/>them
                                to the improvement of our farms we have<br/>employed men to build
                                houses &amp;fences &amp;open our<br/>farms upon which we are at work
                                you sent two<br/>men amongst us &amp; told us they were to aid
                                &amp;<br/>assist us it has now been two years since you sent<br/>men
                                amongst us it is seldom or never we see them <pb facs="BYM_Page_186" n="186"></pb><br/>working inside of our fences from this you<br/>must not
                                understand me that I am displea<br/>sed with the aid we have
                                received we are<br/>entirely satisfied with it It is two years
                                since<br/>you sent these people amongst us. I repeat<br/>they have
                                not been so useful to us as I expected<br/>yet I am not
                                dissatisfied- They generally<br/>work a field by themselves beyond
                                our house<br/>we are glad of the aid you have offered us, But
                                <br/>would be better pleased if you would extend<br/>your aid more
                                generally amongst us<br/>My Brothers would then have reason to
                                be<br/>glad as well as myself. You have told us<br/>that these
                                people you have sent amongst us<br/>would aid &amp; assist us. This
                                is an evidence of the<br/>good you wish to do for us &amp; it is a
                                misfortune<br/>among your red Brethren that they are not all<br/>of
                                one sentiment on this subject. we are very glad<br/>of the aid that
                                you have sent us, we would rather<br/>the young men you send us
                                would aid us in our<br/>own fields they would be of more service to
                                us<br/>in this way. It also has been said amongst us<br/>when our
                                Brethren wish to withdraw from us<br/>altogether, who is to take
                                possession of their<br/>improvements they are not sufficient for us
                                all <pb facs="BYM_Page_187" n="187"></pb><br/>last year the young men you sent raised a
                                fine<br/>crop of corn. We were glad when we were going<br/>home to
                                hear them say it should be divided<br/>among us, this was very
                                pleasing to us I<br/>thanked you in my heart for the aid you<br/>had
                                intended to our people. some days after<br/>this we were informed
                                that our Brothers inten<br/>ded to gather the corn and put it up in
                                a crib, we<br/>then understood that the corn would be put
                                up<br/>&amp; reserved for us until spring when it would be<br/>of
                                more use, That our brothers would return<br/>and divide it among us
                                this When <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshaw1">John Shaw<persname key="jshaw1"></persname></a><br/>arrived he
                                told us that when our people were<br/>in need of corn to come down
                                &amp; get it. I told<br/>J Shaw that the Indians considered the corn
                                as<br/>given to them last fall &amp; that they would not<br/>be so
                                well satisfied as if the Indians were<br/>assembled &amp; it was
                                given to them all at once<br/>I then told him not to divide it in
                                the way<br/>he proposed but to let it remain until the
                                arrival<br/>of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>. Shaw
                                observed that what I said was<br/>true but that he thought a number
                                might suffer<br/>for want of it during the absence of Wm Wells &amp;
                                that<br/>the said Wm Wells had requested him to lend him<br/>some of
                                the corn, When Friends &amp; Wm Wells came &amp; went <pb facs="BYM_Page_188" n="188"></pb><br/>away again. I was to that the corn was all gone<br/>when my
                                people went down to receive the corn<br/>they found it had almost
                                all been removed<br/>I then told the people not to receive it as
                                there<br/>would not be enough for them all- I am high<br/>ly pleased
                                to see you in this Country. You ex<br/>pected to find your young men
                                working in<br/>our fields, instead of which you found
                                them<br/>working in a field by themselves, we would<br/>like it much
                                better if they would work in<br/>our fields- The Chiefs not being
                                present I<br/>do not find myself authorised to say any<br/>thing
                                further on the subject-</p></said>

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/etyso1">Elisha Tyson<persname key="etyso1"></persname></a> then observed that they
                    appeared<br/>desirous of receiving further assistance, &amp; that<br/> to extend
                    more than one place. We told<br/>your Chiefs when in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> that we could<br/>not assist them at more than one
                    place at a <br/>time, that we were poor but their father the<br/>President was
                    rich &amp; able to help them, and<br/>we had learned that he had promised
                    them<br/>his aid &amp; we cannot understand why the young<br/>men with their
                    tools which their father had<br/>sent were turned back when the expense
                    was<br/>nothing to the Indians yet it cost your father <pb facs="BYM_Page_189" n="189"></pb><br/>the
                    President much money. When your gen<br/>eral council meets we shall expect an
                    answer<br/>to all we have said &amp; particularly to the<br/>address of the
                    committee herewith handed &amp;<br/>deposited with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wwell1">Wm
                        Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>. Our young men on the<br/><geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> must have time to raise corn for them<br/>selves &amp;
                    their horses. Whilst at work they have<br/>had a house to raise &amp; other work
                    to do &amp; have<br/>not had time hitherto to raise more than was<br/>sufficient
                    for their own use &amp; that the surplus<br/>shall always be given to the
                    Indians &amp; not<br/>sold. The object of our young men in coming to<br/>your
                    country was to learn you to work &amp; not to<br/>raise corn for themselves. The
                    young men have<br/>put away as much of the corn only as was suf<br/>ficient for
                    their own support, the balance will<br/>be delivered to the Indians at any time
                    they<br/>want it. When your Chiefs were at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a><br/>they informed us that they walked in the
                    thorny<br/>path and wished to walk after us, We want them<br/>to do as we do, to
                    accustom their children to work<br/>when young &amp; this is the way to walk in
                    the path <br/>which we have walked in<br/>after which the council adjourned</p>
<pb facs="BYM_Page_190" n="190"></pb>
<p>It appearing to be he united judgment<br/>of the committee that but little
                    permanent<br/>advantage will likely to result to the <br/>Indians from the aid
                    furnished them by<br/>Friends whilst they have access to spirituous<br/>liquors,
                    with which destructive article they<br/>frequently supply themselves by going
                    into<br/>the state of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a> and a prospect
                    being<br/>opened that by an application on the part<br/>of Friends to the

                    procuring it within the jurisdiction<br/>of that state. The subject after solid

                    they were also desired to examine<br/>the Treasurer acct &amp; report the state
                    of our funds</p>
<p>Then adjourned to meet on the evening of the 12th<br/>Inst. at the 7th hour- at
                    which time the committee again<br/>met present 18 Members</p>
<p>The proposal of addressing the Legislature<br/>of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a> on the subject of the introduction<br/>of Spirituous
                    liquors amongst the Indians from<br/>that state being again weightily
                    considered, it<br/>was concluded best to decline the prospect at<br/>this
                    time</p>
<p>The friends appointed produced the<br/>following report to the Yearly Meeting
                    which<br/>was approved, to wit.</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>We the committee on Indian concerns<br/>Report that since the last yearly
                            meeting we<br/>have continued our exertions to promote the<br/>concern
                            of friends for effecting the civilization<br/>of the Indian natives
                            &amp; the introduction of the<br/>arts of husbandry amongst them &amp;
                            altho no great<br/>progress appears since our last report yet
                            we<br/>hope there is ground of encouragment to<br/>persevere in the
                            benevolent work</p>
<p>Some time after our last yearly meeting<br/>the young men who had been
                            engaged by friends<br/>to assist the Indians at our settlement on
                                the<br/><geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> returned and
                            informed us that they had <pb facs="BYM_Page_192" n="192"></pb><br/>raised a good crop of corn
                            which they<br/>had previous to their leaving that place<br/>secured in a
                            crib- on their departure<br/>from the station they were
                            accompanyed<br/>by several of the principal Indians of<br/>the Village
                            as far as <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, at<br/>which
                            place on taking leave of them<br/>these Indians expressed their
                            gratitude<br/>to friends for the kind assistance they<br/>had furnished
                            them and desired our young<br/>men to inform us that they earnestly
                            hoped<br/>we would still continue our friendly aid<br/>towards them</p>
<p>From the information received it was<br/>the united judgment of the
                            committee that the<br/>situation of the settlement required the
                            further<br/>attention of friends</p>
<p>The same persons who were employed the<br/>past season were accordingly
                            engaged &amp; having<br/>set out early in the spring, reached the
                            settlement<br/>about the middle of the 4th month last. By<br/>accounts
                            received from them it appears that<br/>the Indians were much pleased at
                            their return<br/>&amp; they found the settlement in as good a
                            situ<br/>ation as could be expected, the corn which<br/>had been the
                            last fall secured in cribs <pb facs="BYM_Page_193" n="193"></pb><br/>would be very seasonable
                            relief to divers of the<br/>families in the Village who were much
                            in<br/>need of it at that time, having lost many of<br/>their Hogs
                            during the winter for want of food</p>
<p>After solid deliberation on the important<br/>concern confided to us it
                            was the opinion of the<br/>committee that a benefit would result from
                            a<br/>deputation being sent into that country in<br/>order to ascertain
                            the present disposition of the<br/>Indians &amp; the progress they have
                            made in the<br/>knowledge of agriculture &amp; our friends <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/etyso1">ElishaTyson<persname key="etyso1"></persname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jgill2">James Gillingham<persname key="jgill2"></persname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/dgrea1">David Grave<persname key="dgrea1"></persname></a> were<br/>accordingly nominated
                            to that service &amp; proceded<br/>to make the proposed visit early in
                            the last<br/>spring; They arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> in the 5th<br/>month, from which place they
                            proceeded to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a> &amp;
                            were received in a friendly<br/>manner by the Indians, divers of whom
                            had<br/>made considerable progress in the cultivation<br/>of their
                            lands, aided by white men paid out<br/>of their annuities &amp; some of
                            them by their<br/>own labour- The young men in the employ<br/>of Friends
                            at that place were engaged in<br/>preparing for a crop of corn, and
                            appeared to<br/>be acting prudently, the Indians as well as
                            whites<br/>in the neighbourhood expressed satisfaction <pb facs="BYM_Page_194" n="194"></pb><br/>with their conduct since their residence<br/>amongst them-</p>
<p>These friends whilst at the station<br/>had a conference with the Indians
                            of the<br/>Village and delivered a communication<br/>addressed to them
                            by the committee- The<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wloon1">white Loon<persname key="wloon1"></persname></a> a
                            principal chief of the place<br/>on behalf of himself &amp; the others
                            acknowledged<br/>the propriety of what was said, but declined
                            giving<br/>a full reply until after the general council which<br/>was
                            soon after to be held at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,
                            when a<br/>particular reply he said would be made. They<br/>likewise
                            afterwards had a conference with a<br/>deputation from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamy<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Puttowattomy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> nations<br/>at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> at which time an address from<br/>the committee to
                            those nations was delivered to<br/>them, as also a written communication
                            from <br/>the friends themselves</p>
<p>In reply the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fmeda1">5 Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> said that
                            he<br/>felt thankful to the great spirit for having<br/>permited them to
                            meet at that time and<br/>expressed his satisfaction with what was
                            said<br/>but observed that as only a few of the princi<br/>pal chiefs
                            were present they could not reply <pb facs="BYM_Page_195" n="195"></pb><br/>to the speech
                            delivered to them until after it was<br/>laid before their general
                            council and deliberated<br/>on there when a full reply would be
                            made<br/>- neither of these have yet been recd. by us</p>
<p>Whilst these friends were in that country<br/>they were at times much
                            discouraged on acct.<br/>of the sorrowful effects of spirituous
                            liquors<br/>amongst the Indians for notwithstanding the<br/>law of
                            congress which was obtained some years<br/>past in order to prevent this
                            destructive article<br/>being introduced into their country by
                            the<br/>Traders yet it is to be lamented that of<br/>latter time they
                            have obtained it by going<br/>themselves into the state of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a> and purchas<br/>ing it there greatly to
                            their injury &amp; to the<br/>obstruction of the object of our
                            concern</p>
<p>Since the return of our deputation<br/>we have recd. letters from the
                            young men<br/>there informing that their crop of
                            corn<br/>&amp;Vegetables look well as also those of the<br/>Indians,
                            they likewise inform that they have<br/>assisted the principal chief of
                            the village in<br/>building a more comfortable House than he<br/>had
                            heretofore lived in, being nearly 2 stories<br/>high with floors
                            &amp;Partition, and had moreover<br/>aided another Indian in one which
                            he<br/>was building for himself. And several<br/>of the other Indians
                            having expressed a wish <pb facs="BYM_Page_196" n="196"></pb><br/>to remove a small distance out
                            of the<br/>Village in order to have separate fields and<br/>better
                            opportunity of raising stock they con<br/>templated assisting them in
                            building houses<br/>for that purpose as soon as the crop<br/>would be in
                            a situation to admit of it<br/>-our young men also inform that 2
                            of<br/>the Indians had been induced to cultivate<br/>their lands by the
                            plough &amp; that they believed<br/>the late Visit made to them by
                            friends<br/>had been useful to them. Their prin<br/>cipal chief observed
                            that he loved friends<br/>in his heart for the love they
                            manifested<br/>to the Indians</p>
<p>We have examined the Treasurer<br/>acct. and find an unexpended
                            balance<br/>in his hands of $265 36/100 exclusive of<br/>the donation

                            bordering on your state<br/>the most necessary acts of civil life, your

                            this<br/>desirable object, and according proceeded to perform<br/>the
                            service assigned them, but in the course of their efforts<br/>it was
                            found that the quantities of spiritous<br/>Liquors with which those
                            people were supplied by<br/>Traders &amp; others greatly counteracted
                            every measure<br/>devised to improve their situation, this
                            being<br/>abundantly confirmed in a speech delivered<br/>to us by the

                            congress, whereupon<br/>that Body, duly appreciating the magnitude
                            of<br/>the evil, enacted a law authorising the Resident to prohibit the
                            Traders<br/>from carrying distilled Spirits into their country<br/>this
                            being immediately done they were for a time precluded in a great
                            measure<br/>from it, and the good effects soon became obvious<br/>in the
                            general improvement amongst them.<br/>Sanguine hopes were now cherished
                            that those un<br/>happy people who had heretofore been a prey
                            to<br/>want and distress would be induced to abandon<br/>their
                            precarious mode of life, and turn their<br/>attention to agriculture and
                            the arts of civil<br/>life for subsistence, which disposition seemed
                            for<br/>a time increasingly to pervade them, but as the<br/>settlements
                            of white People approached their villages<br/>and hunting camps,
                            Spiritious Liquors were again<br/>brought within their reach, and they

                            habits &amp;<br/>your memorialists are of the opinion that<br/>no
                            exertion on their part will be likely to<br/>produce much permanent

                            from<br/>Spiritous Liquor; many of them are sensible of<br/>its
                            desolating effects and with us deplore its<br/>ravages upon them, but
                            are unable to prevent<br/>its introduction into their country; they
                            have<br/>accordingly addressed a Memorial to the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tjeff2">President of the United States<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a> (a copy of

<p>At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian<br/>concerns present 11 Members</p>
<p>The committee appointed to enquire into the<br/>situation &amp; disposition of
                    that portion of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a><br/>Tribe of
                    Indians, residing on the waters of <geogname key="mohjo">Mohicken<br/>John</geogname>, reported that they had ascertained the
                    Title<br/>of the these Indians, to the 13 sections of Land reserved<br/>for
                    their use by a law of Congress, was good, so long<br/>as they may continue to
                    occupy &amp;cultivate the<br/>same; They further reported, that part of their
                    num<br/>ber had had a conference with some of them, &amp;<br/>that their
                    suffering situation claims our sympathy.<br/>It appeared they were desirous to
                    receive aid form<br/>Friends, and disposed to cultivate their Lands;
                    the<br/>white people having began to form settlements<br/>beyond them, they will
                    in a little time be precluded<br/>from obtaining a living as heretofore by
                    Hunting,<br/>in which case, they must either have recourse to<br/>agriculture
                    for a subsistence, or abandon their<br/>Lands, should they come to the latter
                    determi<br/>nation, their title to them will be forfeited.<br/>The subject after
                    consideration was refered to a future<br/>meeting of the committee</p>
<p>A letter was rec. from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjohn2">J. Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a> dated <date when="1808-10-19">10mo 19</date><br/>last which being read was

                    that they had gone out<br/>to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a> on
                    the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, early in the last spring<br/>and
                    remained there until about the middle of<br/>last month, during which time they
                    had raised a<br/>crop of good corn, of between 5&amp;600 Bushels, which <pb facs="BYM_Page_203" n="203"></pb><br/>was carefully secured before they came away, they<br/>also
                    raised some Hemp, Tobacco, Potatoes, Turnips &amp;a<br/>variety of Garden
                    Vegetables. The corn was not dis<br/>tributed amongst the Indians this fall, on
                    acct.<br/>of many of them being absent, on Hunting expi<br/>ditions, &amp; their
                    believing it would be more<br/>serviceable in the spring; He likewise informed,
                    <br/>that they had aided the Indians in building<br/>several Houses, after the
                    crop was in a situation<br/>to admit of their attention being withdrawn<br/>from
                    it, and that some of the Indians appeared<br/>industrious and worked steadily,
                    but the corrupting<br/>and debasing influence of Spiritous liquors upon
                    them,<br/>which most pernicious article, they continue to<br/>introduce in large
                    quantities into their Villages<br/>remains to be the principal obstacle to their
                    ge<br/>neral improvement; and if means are not adopted,<br/>to prevent their
                    easy access, to this bane<br/>of civilization &amp; morality, there does not
                    appear<br/>a very encouraging prospect of their progressing<br/>much in
                    improvement, they however appeared generally<br/>thankful, &amp; expressed their

                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">LittleTurtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, whom I remember
                            some years ago, siting<br/>in council with. I think I may say I have
                            felt a<br/>portion of that love which then operated upon<br/>my heart
                            attended by a strong desire for the welfare<br/>of you my red brethren:
                            The conference which<br/>we then had, has been strongly impressed upon
                            my<br/>mind; I have often remembered our communications,<br/>and
                            particularly the solitude expressed by them, at <pb facs="BYM_Page_205" n="205"></pb><br/>that
                            time, that our society would afford some assis<br/>tence to our red
                            brethren, in instructing them in<br/>the cultivation of the Earth, and
                            in the knowledge<br/>of some of the more useful arts of civil life.</p>
<p>Brothers <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">The Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> no doubt
                            remembers his then<br/>having expressed to us his regret
                            that<br/>spiritous liquors were so frequently introduced<br/>amongst the
                            Indians, by the traders, and his then<br/>requesting the aid of our
                            Society, in order to re<br/>present to the Government, the baneful
                            effects<br/>of that pernicious article &amp; he no doubt
                            also<br/>recollects, that some of us, in consequence
                            thereof<br/>attended congress in company with him &amp; the
                            other<br/>chiefs</p>
<p>Brothers<br/>In consequence of the expectations<br/>then made, a law was
                            passed, empowering the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tjeff2">President of the
                                United States<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a> to restrain the traders<br/>from furnishing
                            that article to the Indians, &amp;<br/>we were there united with you in
                            the opinion, that<br/>while it was so freely used amongst our red
                            Brethren<br/>it would be a considerable obstruction to
                            their<br/>improvement. As soon as that difficulty seemd<br/>to be
                            removed, we apprehended it was time<br/>for us to take some steps
                            towards carrying the<br/>concern of our religious society into effect,
                            and<br/>as we were not fully acquainted with the situ<br/>ation of of
                            our red Brethren we concluded to<br/>send some of our Brothers into your
                            Country, where<br/>they had a conference with divers of the chiefs of
                            our <pb facs="BYM_Page_206" n="206"></pb><br/>red brethren, and a situated was pointed
                            out<br/>where we should commence our operations &amp;<br/>make an
                            establishment, for it appeared to us<br/>that the most effectual way of
                            carrying our views<br/>into execution, was to begin our efforts at
                            particular<br/>spot, and it was then our contention that when<br/>our
                            red brethren should become sufficiently<br/>instructed at that place,
                            (so as to be able to<br/>do without our assistance) to remove to
                            some<br/>other village in order to continue our aid</p>
<p>Brothers! From the report of those who were<br/>appointed by the society
                            to carry on our ope<br/>rations on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, it has never appeard to<br/>us, that the time
                            was yet come, in which it<br/>would be proper for our young men to
                            desert<br/>that establishment, and go to any other place. It<br/>may not
                            be best to withhold from our red brothers<br/>that the society has met
                            with considerable dis<br/>couragments on being informed, that
                            notwithstanding<br/> the benevolent measures of the Government in
                            order<br/>to prevent the introduction of spiritous liquors<br/>amongst
                            the Indians, some of them, go amongst<br/>the white people and bring to
                            their villages large<br/>supplies of them, this information induced us
                            to<br/>write to our red brethren, and inform them of<br/>the
                            discouragments we were under, and to endeavor<br/>to impress upon their
                            minds, the necessity there was<br/>for all those, who desire to make
                            improvements in<br/>agriculture and other useful arts of civil life,
                            to<br/>decline the use of spiritous liquors, but we have been <pb facs="BYM_Page_207" n="207"></pb><br/>satisfactorily informed, that tho these
                            communicating<br/>had not reached the Chiefs, before the
                            commencement<br/>of their general council, they had themselves
                            taken<br/>the subject into consideration, and addressed a<br/>petition
                            to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tjeff2">President of the United
                            States<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a><br/>desiring that the people of the State of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a><br/>&amp; Territories of the
                            United States, might be<br/>restricted from selling spiritous liquors to
                            the<br/>Indians. This would have operated as an<br/>encouragement to us,
                            to persevere in the busi<br/>ness which we had undertaken, had we
                            not<br/>been informed by a communication from<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, being the proceedings of the
                            general<br/>council, that some of the Indians were disposed<br/>to
                            dispence with our further services- As this<br/>is the situation of the
                            business at present when<br/>we head of the arrival of our red brethren
                                in<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> this day it was
                            pleasing to us for we<br/>wished an opportunity of this sort with them,
                            that<br/>we might sit down together and endeavour to fal together.
                            And<br/>I hope as we are now here met in council, we<br/>may speak
                            freely, and that if our red brethren<br/>should have met with any thing,
                            which has not<br/>been to then satisfaction, in our intercourse
                            with<br/>them, they would freely open to us their minds</p>
<p>Brothers! As our concern has led us to sympathise<br/>with our red
                            brethren in different parts of this<br/>Country, we have never found
                            ourselves confined <pb facs="BYM_Page_208" n="208"></pb><br/>in our prospects, and if at any
                            time, any become<br/>dissatisfied with us, we desire that they
                            would<br/>freely commuicate to us their dissatisfaction, yet<br/>tho' we
                            are sensible our motives are pure, having<br/>no prospect of reaping any
                            advantages to ourselves,<br/>in the prosecution of this concern, but
                            that<br/>peace of mind, which will ever be the attendant<br/>upon every
                            act of benevolence, our red brothers<br/>must no doubt see, that after
                            having had our<br/>minds exercised on their accounts, and
                            seen<br/>engaged in endeavours to promote their benefit<br/>so long in
                            their past of the continent, it would<br/>be a disagreeable circumstance
                            to us, to seperate<br/>ourselves from them; but if they are
                            dissatisfied,<br/>and wish us to withdraw, from them, we shall<br/>turn
                            our attention to some other quarter of <br/>the country, in which our
                            red brothers reside. As<br/>the concern has arisen from pure love in
                            our<br/>hearts, flowing towards the red people, it does not<br/>appear,
                            that we can give over our exertions, wen<br/>if discouragements are
                            thrown in our way, but if<br/>we are rejected in one place we shall turn
                            to<br/>those who are willing to receive us, we now therefore<br/>wish
                            our brothers to use that freedom, which one<br/>brother ought to use to
                            another, in communiting <br/>without reserve their sentiments to us</p>

<opener>My brothers the Quakers!</opener>
<p>In rising to salute you, I<br/>feel happy, &amp; thank the great spirit
                            who has put it<br/>into our power, to take each other by the
                            hand<br/>once more. All that you have said to us is pleasing <pb facs="BYM_Page_209" n="209"></pb><br/>and nothing bad</p>
<p>Brothers! This is not the first time that I have<br/>heard you speak as
                            you now speak; when you<br/>spoke these words to us some years ago we
                            then<br/>answered you</p>
<p>Brothers! when you first spoke to us you<br/>pointed to us the deplorable
                            situation of our<br/>people, in a striking manner. you
                            enumerated<br/>these great evils which were amongst us,<br/>amongst
                            others, you mentioned that of spiritous<br/>liquors which daily destroys
                            us</p>
<p>Brothers! we believed at that time, that you<br/>were perfectly sensible
                            of our situation. we told<br/>you that the evils that existed amongst
                            us<br/>occasioned by strong drink, were too heavy for us to<br/>remove,
                            and we told you that if you really<br/>were concerned, as we believed
                            you to be, in<br/>wishing us well, you would assist us in
                            geting<br/>clear of this great evil</p>
<p>Brothers! we told you, that we could not<br/>restrain our young men from
                            drinking spiritous<br/>liquors, but that we believed, that as the
                            white<br/>people were the makers of this great evil, they<br/>could keep
                            it out of the way of our people, so<br/>that they could get none</p>
<p>Brothers! You say that you went with us to<br/>the seat of Government and
                            that a stop was<br/>put to the introduction of liquor amongst us<br/>as
                            we wished. But brothers I have never seen this<br/>except in the
                            neighbourhood of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>;
                            there<br/>only our young men have not been able to get <pb facs="BYM_Page_210" n="210"></pb><br/>supplied with liquor. They get supplies <br/>from the mouth of
                            the <geogname key="gmiam">great Miamy</geogname> to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, and down the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> to the mouth<br/>of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> and up that river: and there<br/>is no place
                            exempt from liquor except <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort
                            Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>Brothers! You have now asked us if we<br/>had any cause of complaint
                            against you<br/>in the execution of the endeavours you have<br/>and to
                            render us service, our answer to this is<br/>that we have none. I must
                            now tell you, as<br/>I before told you, when I talked with you,
                            <br/>that there were various opinions amongst us<br/>respecting the
                            advantages which you had offered<br/>to us. Brothers we have no
                            complaint to make<br/>against you, or any thing that you have
                            done<br/>for us: we are not dissatisfied with you, but<br/>if any thing
                            has gone wrong, and your good<br/>intentions towards us have been
                            thwarted, it has<br/>been owing to the conduct of those amongst us,
                            who<br/>wish to continue us, in our present situation, &amp;<br/>prevent
                            you from doing those good things which<br/>you wish to do for us</p>
<p>Brothers! You have told us to speak freely,<br/>we do so, what I now say
                            comes from my heart. Your<br/>red brethren the Indians love you: It is
                            true some<br/>of them have said that they were willing to
                            dispense<br/>with your services, but this is not the
                            unannimous<br/>opinion of your red brethren; Those who have
                            said<br/>this have never received any services from you.- as<br/>they
                            have recd. none, consequently they have none to <pb facs="BYM_Page_211" n="211"></pb><br/>dispense with. I am not now prepared to say<br/>anything more to
                            you, but shall carry home<br/>to my people all that you have said to
                            us</p>

                    hands, and appeared very<br/>desirous of receiving assistance from us.
                    He<br/>further stated that he hoped, that the love<br/>which has subsisted
                    between the old men, of his<br/>people &amp; us would continue to cement
                    our<br/>children, &amp; childrens children, &amp; that for his part,<br/>he
                    should never forget us, whilst the great<br/>spirit might be pleased to continue
                    his existence</p>

<p>In conformity to our appointment, we have<br/>taken into consideration
                            the prospect of the com<br/>mittee, to become possessed of a tract of
                            Land<br/>contiguous to the Indians, in order to form a<br/>permanent
                            settlement from whence, our aid can<br/>be more conveniently and
                            advantageously directed<br/>to them; after the best view we have been
                            capable<br/>of taking of the subject, we are united in sen<br/>timent,
                            that the time has come, in which such<br/>a measure is expedient.</p>
<p>we propose that the committee endeavour<br/>to obtain a tract of Land
                            suitable for a Farm<br/>near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort

<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> started to the committee, that
                    since<br/>his arrival at the present time in this city, he had recd.<br/>many
                    proofs of the strong friendship of his brothers<br/>the Quakers for the Indians;
                    and that notwith<br/>standing many of his people, had rendered
                    themselves<br/>unworthy of our regard, by paying no attention<br/>to our advice
                    &amp; some of them even had rejected our aid<br/>yet he had observed that our
                    love for them appeared<br/>not to be diminuished. He then expressed
                    his<br/>obligations for the personal regard we had manifested<br/>for him, and
                    informed the committee that as they<br/>had, been so kind as to express a
                    willingness to ex<br/>tend some aid to his village, he would take
                    the<br/>liberty to point out the mode which would most<br/>satisfactorily meet
                    his wishes, this he said was, to<br/>errect some kind of mill there, either to
                    go by<br/>Horses or water as we might judge most proper. This<br/>he said would
                    render an important service to his<br/>people &amp; be highly gratifying to

<opener>To our brother the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Little
                            Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a></opener>
<p>Since the first time we took each other by the<br/>hand several years
                            ago, we have always felt a<br/>strong solicitude for the welfare of our
                            red brethren<br/>and an ardent desire to render them every
                            assistance<br/>in our power.</p>
<p>Brother! It is this disposition towards them, which<br/>has led us into
                            their country, and we have every<br/>year since that time kept some
                            persons employed to<br/>instruct them in those things which we
                            apprehended<br/>would promote their comfort &amp; improvement</p>
<p>Brother! we have already informed them, that<br/>our means are not great,
                            and that we have never<br/>found ourselves in a situation to extend our
                            opera<br/>tions to more than one Village at a time</p>
<p>Brother! It was by the agreement of our red<br/>brethren that we
                            commenced our operations on<br/>the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>- and they have been informed that <pb facs="BYM_Page_217" n="217"></pb><br/>we have not heretofore, thought our brothers at<br/>that place
                            sufficiently instructed to admit of our<br/>withdrawing from them</p>
<p>Brother! As soon as we believed the time was<br/>approaching, when the
                            situation of our brothers<br/>there, would admit of our extending
                            assistance to<br/>some other place, we turned our views to
                                the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/lturtown">Turtles Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a> as the
                            next which should claim<br/>our attention</p>
<p>Brother! our brothers on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>
                            &amp; us have<br/>had time and opportunity to get fully
                            acquainted<br/>with each other, and in proportion as our know<br/>ledge
                            of one another has increased, our love for<br/>each other has been
                            strengthened</p>
<p>Brother! They have signified to us, that they<br/>are greatly thankful
                            for the aid we have given<br/>them, and they earnestly intreat us not to
                            with<br/>draw from them, we must therefore still continue<br/>to render
                            them some help, until they become<br/>stronger &amp; better able to help
                            themselves</p>
<p>Brother! Our brothers on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>
                            have<br/>now got a large piece of ground cleared &amp; under<br/>fences,
                            and they are in some measure instructed<br/>how to cultivate it; They
                            will therefore we hope<br/>begin to be able to do with less help from
                            us<br/>we have listened with attention to the request<br/>of our brother
                            to build him a mill, and as we<br/>feel great love for him, and a strong
                            disposition<br/>to meet his wishes, as far as in our power, we<br/>have
                            concluded to do this for him, as we may find <pb facs="BYM_Page_218" n="218"></pb><br/>ourselves
                            in a situation to accomplish it</p>
<p>Brothers! we will therefore endeavour to divide<br/>our aid between the
                                <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> &amp; the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/lturtown">Turtles Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a> -<br/>our brother must not
                            expect the mill to be built<br/>immediately, we must first direct an
                            exami<br/>nation to be made of the situation at his Village<br/>before
                            we can determine what kind of a one<br/>can best be put up for him-
                            Perhaps there may<br/>not be a place for a water mill; this we
                            will<br/>enquire into</p>
<p>Brother! After we shall have made the necessary<br/>examination, we will
                            then determine on the<br/>kind of mill most proper, and inform our
                            Brother<br/>thereof.</p>
<p>We request our brother will accept the assurances<br/>of our sincere
                            &amp; affectionate regard: we rejoice that<br/>he and us have been
                            permited to have an oppor<br/>tunity of again taking one another by the
                            hand,<br/>and renewing those friendly sentiments, which<br/>we before
                            entertained towards each other, and<br/>our desire to the Great Spirit
                            is, that he will<br/>preserve our brother, through the long journey
                            he<br/>has before him, and return him safe to the bosom<br/>of his
                            family &amp;people.<br/>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lturt1">Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>

<p>My Brothers! The communication you have just<br/>made to me is highly
                            pleasing, and I return you <br/>my sincere thanks</p>
<p>Brothers! You observe that your brothers on the<br/><geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> are unwilling to part with you- this<br/>I know
                            to be true, and I rejoice that you still retain<br/>your friendship for
                            them, notwithstanding attempts have<br/>been made to prejudice you
                            against them, and the <pb facs="BYM_Page_219" n="219"></pb><br/>discouragements which you have
                            had to encounter</p>
<p>Brothers! I believed the building of a mill was the<br/>best thing you
                            can do for my people, I have therefore<br/>asked it of you; I think it
                            will encourage them to<br/>raise large crops of corn &amp; perhaps
                            wheat, and it will<br/>certainly afford a great convenience to those
                            who<br/>reside in the neighbourhood of my Village</p>
<p>Brothers! I cannot omit again expressing to you my<br/>thanks- I shall
                            carry your words home &amp; repeat<br/>them to my people. </p>

                    commini<br/>cated an interesting account of the present<br/>situation &amp;
                    disposition of those Indians who<br/>reside on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/whiter">White

<p>Whereas certain of my friends at this place who<br/>have the good of the
                            Indians at heart, have<br/>requested me to state the causes which
                            induced<br/>me &amp; my companions to visit our western alies<br/>I
                            therefore feel it to be my duty to state as<br/>follows-</p>
<p>1st I and the principal men of my nation<br/>do firmly believe that it
                            was the will of the<br/>good &amp; great spirit to unite our
                            ancestors<br/>with the the ancestors of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>- <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/munseeind">Monsey<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a><br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Esopus<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/waupug">Waupug<orgname key="waupug"></orgname></a> Nations, and enabled them<br/>to enter into a
                            covenant of friendship, which<br/>connected them in one confederacy,
                            which<br/>friendship their ancestors &amp; ours have never
                            vio<br/>lated</p>
<p>Our ancestors were enabled to establish a <br/>permanent praise with the
                            different tribes<br/>of Indians (to wit) the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>- <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/potaw">Potawatimies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a><br/>

                            Grandfathers &amp; we call<br/>them grandchildren which peace has
                            been<br/>maintained ever since as also with the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a><br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>- and the southern tribes 3d I
                            and rest<br/>of the chiefs of my nation together with our<br/>young men
                            are desirous to maintain peace and<br/>unity among these nations- And
                            the articles of<br/>the treaty of peace with the U.S- We found
                            many<br/>of these Indians in a deplorable situation these<br/>many years
                            past- And we are sensible our good<br/>wishes can never do them any good
                            without our <pb facs="BYM_Page_222" n="222"></pb><br/>utmost exertions indeed</p>
<p>4th The history of the indians since the Europeans<br/>first settled on
                            this Island as well as our own<br/>experience convinces us that all the
                            different<br/>tribes would decrease until they become extinct<br/>as
                            nations, unless they can be prevailed on to<br/>relinquish the old rough
                            path which they have<br/>been following and get into the path
                            which<br/>leads to peace &amp; happiness</p>
<p>5th My Co-chief and our councellers being impres<br/>sed with the above
                            sentiments held a general<br/>Council on the subject and believed it to
                            be<br/>their duty to appoint me together with three of <br/>our
                            counsellors &amp;five principal young men<br/>to visit the above
                            mentioned tribes in order to<br/>renew the covenant of friendship which
                            had<br/>subsisted between our ancestors &amp; theirs and to<br/>deliver
                            to them the best counsel we could give them<br/>I believed it to be my
                            duty to comply with the<br/>request of my nation as well as the
                            impressions<br/>which I often felt on my heart, I therefore with<br/>the
                            eight men of my nation proceeded on our<br/>journey in <date when="1803-10">Oct 1803</date>- and having renewed<br/>our covenant
                            of friendship with the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> &amp;<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/munseeind">Monseys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a> as also other tribes they
                            desired that I and<br/>my nation should remove and dwell with
                            them<br/>on the Land on <geogname key="whiter">white river</geogname>
                            which tract had<br/>been granted to this confederacy by the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamies<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a><br/>&amp; other tribes at their
                            general council near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/vince">Post

                            also <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjaco1">John Jacobs<persname key="jjaco1"></persname></a>- <persname key="jnaun1">Jacob <pb facs="BYM_Page_223" n="223"></pb><br/>Nannuhsstang</persname>

                            tribes<br/>for the purpose of doing all we could to pro<br/>mote their
                            welfare, and we left our homes &amp;<br/>families in <date when="1807-07">July 1807</date> their situation appeared<br/>to
                            gloomy that I felt it my duty to stay with<br/>them and to use my utmost
                            endeavous to<br/>promote the useful arts of agriculture amongst
                            <br/>them-And they are inclined to learn them<br/>and greatly desire we
                            should liver and die<br/>with them in that country</p>
<p>I have found a willing<br/>mind to undertake to make a proper
                            trial<br/>to draw them into the path of civilization<br/>I accordingly
                            left five of my young men in<br/>their country to help the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> this winter<br/>to cut timber for
                            nails until I return to<br/>them in the spring-</p>
<p>I stated the foregoing circumstances<br/>to the President of the U-S- in
                            substance<br/>and informed you already of the encourage<br/>ment he gave
                            me you will percieve in<br/>order to proceed in this laudable work it
                            is<br/>essential my five young men should have<br/>some encouragement
                            from the government or<br/>friends- <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjaco1">J

                            and is well qualified to teach<br/>the children to read &amp; write

<br/>is an ingenious Carpenter- understands the<br/>management of a
                            grist and saw mill- And <br/>can keep them in repair- the other three
                            young men<br/>are active and industrious and can use the axe <pb facs="BYM_Page_224" n="224"></pb><br/>and hoe on a farm. they left home with me<br/>well cloathed but
                            before I came away they<br/>were nearly naked but in order to
                            encourage<br/>&amp; make them as comfortable as I could while<br/>I am
                            absent from them I had on 50 dols<br/>worth of cloath from Johnston for
                            them to<br/>&amp; should be remembered that we raised <br/>nothing but
                            corn last summer in that country<br/>and we wish to be diligent at our
                            work<br/>yet we cannot work hard without substantial<br/>food now if the
                            men should be obliged to<br/>Hunt for food or Cloath they must of
                            neces<br/>sity neglect the farming business, and if I <br/>cannot obtain
                            some supplies of provision<br/>before the crops come on they will suffer
                            &amp;<br/>indeed if they could not hear some encourage<br/>ment I fear
                            my young men will abandon<br/>this object &amp; return to their own
                            homes-<br/>I therefore earnestly hope my friends will<br/>take this into
                            their serious consideration<br/>And I do firmly believe that by the
                            blessing<br/>of the great good Spirit we may do much<br/>good for these
                            poor Indians- my hopes &amp;<br/>expectations for their future
                            advancements<br/>are greatly strengthened from various
                            cir<br/>cumstances among other things. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a><br/>and the other Indians at the <geogname key="whiter">white river</geogname><br/>in a general council held by
                            the Chiefs &amp; <br/>head warriors, with the young men at
                            that<br/>place last August they passed a law by<br/>general consent that
                            if any person should bring <pb facs="BYM_Page_225" n="225"></pb><br/>any liquors to our town it
                            should be imme<br/>diately spilled on the ground and the<br/>person
                            should loose it-</p>
<p>As my friends will probably wish to<br/>know what assistance we may most
                            stand<br/>in need of. I will observe that I expect<br/>about 10 barrels
                            of pork 12 Barrels of flour<br/>&amp; two bushels of salt will be
                            nessisary to<br/>subsist the Indians until their crop will<br/>come on
                            this if it is furnished to me it<br/>shall only be distributed to those
                            who<br/>will quit hunting and closely apply<br/>Themselves to work- I
                            should like to have<br/>about eight breeding sows &amp; two Boars.
                            Some<br/>grass seeds some oats &amp; wheat seeds, Some<br/>potatoes some
                            flax seed and the means<br/>of procuring some cloathing for my 5

<p>The committee after solid deliberation on<br/>the present situation of the
                    concern refered to<br/>us by the yearly meeting, were united in the<br/>judgment
                    that under present circumstances it<br/>will be most prudent to confine our
                    ope<br/>rations for the present season to the employing<br/>of two persons for
                    the purpose of aiding the<br/>Indians on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> 2 or 3 months in<br/>puting in their crop and geting it
                    so far<br/>forward as that they will able to cultivate<br/>&amp;secure it
                    afterwards themselves. The sub com<br/>mittee were accordingly directed to give
                    this in<br/>formation to that part of the committee who<br/>reside on the west

                            and informed that they<br/>had gone out early in the spring and
                            remained<br/>at our <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a> on the

                            of the 11th month last during which<br/>time they had raised a crop of
                            good corns of<br/>between 5 &amp; 600 Bushels in the Ear which
                            was<br/>carefully secured before they came away- They<br/>had also
                            raised a variety of Vegetables which<br/>were given to the Indians. The
                            corn also<br/>has since been distributed among such of<br/>the Indian
                            families as appeared most in need<br/>of it- our young men further
                            informed that<br/>they had aided the Indians in building
                            several<br/>Houses after the crop was in a situation to admit<br/>of
                            their attention being withdrawn from it, and <pb facs="BYM_Page_231" n="231"></pb><br/>that some
                            of them appeared industrious and<br/>worked steadily, but the corrupting
                            and debasing<br/>influence of Spiritous liquors upon them
                            which<br/>article they at that time continued to introduce<br/>in large
                            quantities into their villages was found<br/>to be a great obstacle in
                            the way of their<br/>general improvement, and it was the judgment<br/>of
                            these friends that if means could not<br/>be adapted to prevent their
                            easy access to<br/>this bane of civilization and morality, there<br/>did
                            not appear a very encouraging prospect<br/>of their progressing much in
                            improvement<br/>they however appeared generally thankful<br/>and
                            expressed their obligations for the assistance<br/>they had received</p>

                            and interpreted to the<br/>different Tribes when assembled in their
                            General<br/>council in the <date when="1808-09">9th mo 1808</date> and
                            that they had on<br/>a full consideration of the subject,
                            unitedly<br/>agreed to Petition the Government of the U. States <pb facs="BYM_Page_232" n="232"></pb><br/>to interdict the future transportation of
                            that<br/>article into their country, which petition<br/>they forwarded
                            to us and at the same time<br/>solicited the aid of Friends in promoting
                            such<br/>measures as might hereafter relieve them from<br/>the dreadful
                            consequences of this great distroyer<br/>amongst them</p>
<p>The committee taking into consideration<br/>the destructive effects which
                            during <br/>their intercourse with the Indians<br/>they had observed to
                            flow from their excessive use<br/>of spiritious liquors, and which had
                            greatly<br/>paralised every exertion for their improvement<br/>were
                            unanimously of the opinion that it<br/>became their duty to pay such
                            attention to<br/>the application received as might hereafter tend<br/>to
                            relieve these unhappy people from the<br/>calamities and distresses
                            which they were suffering<br/>from distilled spiritous liquors. We
                            accordingly<br/>presented the memorial of the Indians to
                            the<br/>President of the U.S. who readily engaged to use<br/>his
                            influence with the Government of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a><br/>and of Territories of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/indiana">Indiana<placename key="indiana"></placename></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/michi1">Michigan<placename key="michi1"></placename></a><br/>from whence the Indians principally
                            drew<br/>their supplies of this article, to obtain<br/>such relief and
                            could be procured. The<br/>committee also with the concurence of the <pb facs="BYM_Page_233" n="233"></pb><br/>Meeting for Sufferings forwarded a memorial<br/>to
                            legislature of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a> requesting its
                            attention<br/>to the subject and that it would adopt such<br/>measures
                            for the relief of the Indians<br/>as might appear beneficial &amp;
                            proper and<br/>it is with great satisfaction we can inform<br/>the
                            Yearly Meeting, that a law was obtained<br/>which intirely interdicts
                            under heavy penalties<br/>the transportation of any intoxicating
                            liquors<br/>out of that state for the purpose of being<br/>Vended to
                            Indians, and also the furnishing any<br/>to Indians who may come within
                            the<br/>limits of the state- We have also the satis<br/>faction to add
                            that we have understood that<br/>similar laws have been passed in the
                            Territories,<br/>and as it was principally from these places<br/>that
                            the Indians obtained their supplies of <br/>Spiritous liquors the
                            committee indulges the<br/>hope that they will not hereafter have
                            to<br/>struggle against the powerful obstacles which<br/>this most
                            pernicious article has heretofore<br/>thrown in their way and which had
                            discouraged<br/>them from extending much assistance the<br/>present
                            year, they therefore cannot but rejoice<br/>in the prospect which now
                            opens before them <pb facs="BYM_Page_234" n="234"></pb><br/>and feel strongly animated to
                            continue their<br/>efforts with increased diligence &amp; zeal</p>
<p>The committee may further inform that<br/> a considerable number of the
                            principal<br/>cheifs of the different nations of Indians<br/>bordering
                            on the United States passed through<br/>this city during the last winter
                            amongst<br/>these were several of the chiefs of those Tribes<br/>with
                            whom we have had an acquaintance<br/>and divers conferences took place
                            between us<br/>and them on the general subject of our<br/>concern. From
                            the information which they<br/>gave us it appeard that a disposition is
                            pre<br/>vailing amongst their people to turn their<br/>attention towards
                            the cultivation of their<br/>lands, and to establish themselves in
                            fixed<br/>habitations, and we are strengthened in the<br/>opinion that
                            as the great obstacle to their<br/>improvement has we trust been removed
                            this<br/>disposition will continue to gain ground amongst<br/>them and
                            that notwithstanding we have had<br/>many discouraging circumstances to
                            encounter<br/>yet there is encouragement for Friends to<br/>persevere in
                            the benevolent work they have<br/>engaged in and a comfortable hope
                            that<br/>as we are favoured patiently to abide under<br/>the weight of
                            this concern our labours will <pb facs="BYM_Page_235" n="235"></pb><br/>ultimately be crowned

<p>present 17 Members</p>
<p>Information was communicated<br/>to the committee that letters had been
                    recd.<br/>from the Indian agent at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>
                    and also<br/>from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshaw1">John Shaw<persname key="jshaw1"></persname></a> stating that from
                    the disposition<br/>which appears at this time to prevail amongst<br/>the
                    Indians on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> there was not
                    a<br/>prospect of much benefit being likely to result <pb facs="BYM_Page_237" n="237"></pb><br/>to these
                    Indians from friends continuing their aid<br/>to them. And at the same time
                    remarking that the<br/>settlement of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Wapakanetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a>
                    were<br/>very anxious to recieve assistance from Friends, and<br/>had very
                    generally manifested a disposition to<br/>turn their attention to agriculture
                    and had already<br/>made some progress in the cultivation of their<br/>Lands,
                    these letters likewise inform that a Grist <br/>and Saw Mill had begun at this
                    settlement<br/>and may with a moderate Expence be compleated</p>
<p>The sub-committee reported that on rect. <br/>of these Letters, they likely had
                    informed that Secretary of<br/>War that we might probably be induced to
                    direct<br/>our efforts at least for a time to the assistance<br/>of these
                    Indians provided the Government should<br/>approve of it, and they now produced
                    his reply<br/>in which he expresses his intire approbation of<br/>our removing
                    there, and at the same time relin<br/>quishes to the direction of the Society
                    the whole<br/>of the public property and materials which<br/>had been collected
                    there for the use and benefit<br/>of the Indians.</p>
<p>After solid consideration the committee<br/>were united in judgment that it will
                    be proper<br/>to withdraw for a time from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">wabash<placename key="wabas"></placename></a> and<br/>direct our exertions to the assistance of the

<p>To the Yearly Meeting, now sitting.<br/>The committee on Indian concerns
                            have agreed to inform, that after<br/>their last report they received
                            information, that from a change of cir-<br/>cumstances which had taken
                            place among the Indians at the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wabas">Wabash<placename key="wabas"></placename></a>,<br/>it was not likely that any further endeavours
                            for their assistance could<br/>be continued to advantage- and therefore,
                            after solidly considering the<br/>subject, we were united in believing
                            that it would be best, at least for<br/>a time, to discontinue our
                            efforts in their favour, under the hope, how-<br/>ever, that the causes
                            which have led to this suspension, may only be<br/>temporary, having, as
                            we have understood, been produced by the de-<br/>lusive counsels of an
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tensk1">Indian among them stiled a
                            prophet<persname key="tensk1"></persname></a>, and whose<br/>influence, we hope, may prove to be of
                            a transient nature.</p>
<p>The committee also inform, that having received information that
                            a<br/>number of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawanees<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, at
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Wapakonetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a>, on the <geogname key="augl">Auglaize</geogname>, had mani-<br/>fested a disposition
                            to turn their attention to agriculture, and appeared<br/>desirous that
                            the assistance of Friends might be extended to them ; and,<br/>as our
                            efforts on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> were at present
                            suspended after atten-<br/>tively considering the subject, it was judged
                            expedient to nominate<br/>some of our number to make them a visit, and
                            though way has not yet<br/>opened for that to be accomplished, the
                            committee feel free to observe,<br/>that little or no loss has been
                            sustained ; as the minds of the Indians<br/>in that quarter have been
                            too much agitated during the past summer,<br/>(the delusive influence of
                            the person beforementioned having been also<br/>attempted at this
                            settlement) to afford a prospect, that any instruction<br/>or assistance
                            could have been introduced to advantage among them.<br/>And it may be
                            proper here to mention, that government was informed<br/>of our prospect
                            of affording assistance to these Indians, and expressed<br/>entire
                            approbation.</p>
<p>The committee also appointed a part of their number to make a
                            visit<br/>to some <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, near

<p>The Committee appointed on Indian Concerns have agreed to in-<br/>form,
                            that since our report of last year, we have continued our
                            atten-<br/>tion to the object of our appointment. No opening having
                            presented<br/>to renew our efforts in favour of the Indians residing at

<p>Agreeably to the prospect held up in our last report, a
                            deputation<br/>from our number have made a visit to the settlement at
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Wapako-netta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a>, and upon
                            confering with the Chiefs and others, found the manx-<br/>iously
                            desirous to receive assistance from Friends ; and particularly<br/>to be
                            aided in putting up a Grist and Saw Mill at their town.
                            Upon<br/>examining the seat, it was found not to be so eligible as one
                            could<br/>have been desired ; but, as it appeared to be the best in that
                            neighbour-<br/>hood, it was finally concluded to erect a Grist and Saw
                            Mill there.<br/>Workmen have accordingly been engaged, and are now
                            employed in<br/>erecting them, under the personal superintendence of one
                            of our Com-<br/>mittee, by whom we are informed, that it is expected
                            they will both be<br/>completed in the course of the present season. We
                            may also inform,<br/>that the accounts which have reached us from these
                            Indians, represent<br/>them as generally industrious, and disposed to
                            cultivate their lands ;<br/>divers of them having already been cleared
                            and in cultivation, as much<br/>ground as furnishes an abundant
                            sufficiency of grain for the use of <br/>their own families. And it is
                            hoped that when their Mills shall have<br/>been completed, this
                            disposition will more generally spread amongst<br/>them.</p>
<p>Another deputation from our Committee have also made a visit to<br/>the
                            before mentioned settlements of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/greent">Greens-town<placename key="greent"></placename></a> and<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/jerom">Jerome's-town<placename key="jerom"></placename></a>, near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/mojl">Mohickon-John's Lake<placename key="mojl"></placename></a>. They found these In-<br/>dians
                            industriously disposed, and earnestly desirous of receiving
                            some<br/>assistance from Friends. They were accordingly furnished with
                            such<br/>implements of husbandry as their situation appeared to require,
                            and a <br/>young man of our Society, of exemplary habits, was procured,
                            who re-<br/>sided several months with them, and assisted them in
                            preparing their<br/>tools, and putting in their crops. Several of them
                            have learned to<br/>plough their lands ; and it is hoped that the
                            assistance already furnish-<br/>ed will be of essential service to
                            them.</p>
<p>We may further add, that the late disturbances amongst the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawa-neese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Wapakonetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a> and its vicinity, which so long interrupted
                            our<br/>operations, have nearly subsided.</p>
<p>Upon examining the Treasurer's Accounts, we find balance in his<br/>hands
                            of 1287 dollars 53 cents, exclusive of the principal of the

                    to support his family; but<br/>he is in want of tools &amp; farming utensils and
                    cannot<br/>carry on his business without them. In order to effect<br/>what has
                    already been done at his villages, his <br/>people have been obliged to borrow
                    from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Waupaukanetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a>, but being soon
                    obliged to return them they have<br/>worked to a great disadvantage. He has
                    himself 4<br/>Horses, but no gears to put on them, and should he<br/>obtain
                    assistance from friends, it will be applied by<br/>him for the general benefit
                    of his village</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/clewi2">Captain Lewis<persname key="clewi2"></persname></a> further stated that there
                    are<br/>about 40 young men at his town who are capable<br/>of labour and that
                    they had cleared and fenced<br/>in a considerable quantity of land which
                    was<br/>now under cultivation, that he had this past<br/>year raised a good crop
                    of wheat &amp; corn and proposed<br/>on his return home to open a road from his
                    village<br/>to the mill now building by friends for the use of<br/>the Indians
                    at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Waupaukanetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a>, He also stated<br/>that his
                    people some time since unanimously <br/>determined to listen to the advice they
                    had received<br/>to abstain from spirituous liquors and that none
                    had<br/>latterly been introduced amongst them. <pb facs="BYM_Page_247" n="247"></pb></p>

<p>Brother<br/>The opportunity we have had of taking<br/>each other by the
                            hand and talking together has<br/>been satisfactory to us, and it is
                            particularly pleasing<br/>to learn that our Red brethren at the

                            eyes opened and are now able to see<br/>what is their true interest</p>

                            us for some implements of husbandry<br/>to enable you to carry into
                            effect the determination<br/>you have adopted to turn your attention
                            hereafter<br/>to the cultivation of your lands, and we have
                            concluded<br/>to direct our Brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwrig1">Jonathan
                                Wright<persname key="jwrig1"></persname></a> who lives near<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, to furnish you with 2 ploughs, Gear for

<p>Brother<br/>The information that has reached us<br/>of our brethren at
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/mingot">Mingo Town<placename key="mingot"></placename></a> having
                            totally<br/>abandoned the use of spirituous liquors has been<br/>very
                            pleasing to us, and it is this information that<br/>has determined us to
                            extend the assistance we now<br/>give them<br/>cont. <pb facs="BYM_Page_248" n="248"></pb></p>
<p>Brothers<br/>We hope you will not suffer any more<br/>of this poison to
                            be brought to your town you have<br/>seen the effect of it &amp; must
                            know its consequences;<br/>Spirituous Liquors not only corrupt the minds
                            of those<br/>who drink it, but it also occasions great poverty
                            &amp;<br/>distress in the families of those men who get
                            drunk<br/>because it destroys their reason and disqualifies them<br/>for
                            work, it has this effect upon the white people<br/>who drink it and it
                            will have the same effect<br/>upon you.</p>
<p>Brother<br/>We request our brother will accept<br/>the assurances of our
                            sincere and affectionate<br/>regard: We rejoice that he and us have been
                            per<br/>mitted to have an opportunity of again taking one<br/>another by
                            the hand and of renewing those friendly<br/>sentiments, which we before
                            entertained towards<br/>each other and our desire to the Great Spirit
                            is,<br/>that he will preserve our brother &amp; his family<br/>through
                            the long journey they have before them and<br/>return them safe to their
                            homes.</p>

<p>The Meeting for sufferings in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/lym">London<orgname key="lym"></orgname></a><br/>having lately sent an Epistle to our meeting
                            they therein<br/>request that we will transmit to them such
                            infor<br/>mation of the progress and effect of civilization
                            amongst<br/>the Indian natives as may come under our cognizance<br/>or
                            may arise out of the reports of the several com<br/>mittees engaged in
                            that work: And they further say<br/>that it will be additionally
                            acceptable if the infor<br/>mation include the proceedings of Friends in

                            a<br/>request nearly similar to this, our meeting for
                            suffering<br/>sensible that Friends in England interested in the success<br/>of a cause so
                            congenial with the spirit of christianity<br/>have as brethren a
                            reasonable expectation that we would<br/>freely open to them the state
                            of this business from time to<br/>time, as far as may be material for
                            their knowledge and<br/>satisfaction, have appointed a committee to give
                            attention<br/>to the subject as a part of which we were desired

<p>The Yearly Meeting of Friends in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a><br/>having been brought under an exercise on
                            acct. of<br/>the neglected situation of the Indian Natives of
                            this<br/>continent appointed a committee in the Year <date when="1795">1795</date><br/>to open a communication with some of the

                            and furnish such relief and assistance<br/>to them as they might be
                            enabled to render</p>
<p>The committee proceeded to give considerable<br/>attention to the subject
                            of their appointment but altho'<br/>partial assistance, in tools and
                            implements of husbandry<br/>was from time to time, furnished to several
                            Indian villages<br/>yet no permanent settlement was attempted amongst
                            them<br/>until the Year <date when="1804">1804</date>, at which time a
                            deputation from<br/>the committee, after a full conference with the
                            Chiefs<br/>of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/miami">Miamy<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> confederacy, at
                            their request, commenced <pb facs="BYM_Page_251" n="251"></pb>
<br/>an establishment on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>
                            river, where a number<br/>of Indian families from the neighbouring
                            villages removed,<br/>for the purpose of being instructed in agriculture
                            a<br/>considerable quantity of ground was cleared and put<br/>into
                            cultivation, and most kinds of domestic animals<br/>such as Horses,
                            Cattle, Hogs introduced</p>
<p>After several Years attention at this settlement,<br/>finding that their
                            labours became greatly interrupted<br/>and their views misrepresented by
                            an evil disposed<br/>person who at that time resided with the Indians,
                            and had<br/>acquired an extensive influence amongst them, the
                            com<br/>mittee believed it right after addressing the Natives<br/>on the
                            occasion &amp; explaining fully to them the situation<br/>in which they
                            found themselves to withdraw for a time<br/>from that place. Many of the
                            Indians seemed grateful for<br/>the assistance they had received, and
                            although the establish<br/>ment did not succeed to the extent which the
                            committee<br/>had anticipated, yet it is believed that some
                            essential<br/>advantages have resulted to the Indians there- They
                            have<br/>been brought by experience to feel the benefits of
                            an<br/>agricultural life; &amp; by the introduction of Cattle &amp;
                            Hogs<br/>amongst them, to the rearing of which their country
                            is<br/>peculiarly well adapted, their resources to obtain food<br/>have
                            been increased; Many families have also been<br/>provided with
                            comfortable Houses which has stimulated others<br/>to endeavour to
                            obtain them also and their minds have<br/>been generally excited to look
                            to the cultivation of the<br/>earth for their support, and the committee
                            apprehend<br/>that the time is perhaps not very distant when it
                            may<br/>become right to resume their labours at that place</p>
<p>Applications having been frequently made<br/>to the committee by the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> nation of Indians<br/>for
                            assistance it was concluded upon withdrawing from<br/>the establishment
                            at the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, to turn their
                            attention<br/>towards them, a grist and saw mill have accordingly
                            <br/>been erected in their country and implements of husbandry <pb facs="BYM_Page_252" n="252"></pb><br/>furnished to them; and as this nation appear
                            earnestly<br/>disposed to avail themselves of the assistance which is
                            given<br/>them, and manifest a disposition to become industrious<br/>the
                            committee indulge an expectation, that their efforts<br/>here will
                            suceed. These people have now a considerable<br/>quantity of land in
                            cultivation &amp; many of them raise<br/>as much grain as is necessary
                            for the consumption of their<br/>own families-They have also a
                            considerable number of<br/>cattle Hogs &amp;c. The committee have
                            latterly also extended<br/>some aid to two villages of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> upon the<br/><geogname key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogname>, and have the satisfaction to
                            believe<br/>that an improvement is taking place amongst these</p>
<p>In attending to this service they have hitherto<br/>embraced no other
                            objects than those connected with<br/>the cultivation of the soil, and
                            the introduction of<br/>some of the arts of civil life amongst the
                            Indians, yet<br/>while these have been viewed as necessary
                            preliminaries<br/>in the civilization of those people, the committee
                            have<br/>not been unmindful of the importance of School learning<br/>and
                            those considerations which relate to their religious<br/>improvement but
                            have not yet thought it best to attempt<br/>the introduction of Schools
                            amongst them</p>
<p>It may not be improper further to remark, that<br/>after a number of
                            years of patient and assiduous labour<br/>the committee are confirmed in
                            the opinion that the work<br/>in which they are engaged will continue to
                            be an arduous<br/>one and that much time and exertion will yet
                            be<br/>neccesary to effect any extensive or permanent change<br/>amongst
                            the Indian Natives. Long established habits are<br/>no where easily
                            eradicated and few nations appear to<br/>adhere more strongly to the
                            customs of their ancestors than<br/>these people, added to this, their
                            ardent attachment to<br/>personal freedom, and their having heretofore
                            been entire strangers <br/>to any kind of restraint renders them
                            impatient of labour &amp;<br/>in some measure averse to the pursuits of
                            a steady industrious<br/>life Those more immediately under the care of

                            accustomed<br/>to feed, they are under less necessity of resorting
                            to<br/>agriculture, than those tribes which are surrounded by<br/>the
                            settlement of white people, nevertheless upon a <br/>review of the
                            progress made towards the accomplishment<br/>of the object of their
                            appointment, the committee believe<br/>there is cause of encouragement
                            for Friends to persevere<br/>in this truly laudable and interesting work
                            and that<br/>although they may still have discouragements
                            and<br/>difficulties to encounter, yet they trust the work is

<p>We the committee on Indian concerns<br/>Report that since the last yearly
                            meeting we have received<br/>information, that the Mill which was
                            erected at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/wapak">Waupakannetta<placename key="wapak"></placename></a> for the
                            use of the Indians had been so far<br/>compleated as to commence
                            grinding, and gave general<br/>satisfaction to them as it was expected
                            to be of much<br/>assistance</p>
<p>In order to promote the views of Friends for the<br/>benefit of those

                            the<br/>purpose of taking charge of the Mill and affording<br/>the
                            needful instruction in their agricultural and<br/>domestic concerns, and
                            requested them to procure<br/>such, the committee have however
                            understood, that<br/>owing to the unhappy occurences which about
                            this<br/>time took place in that Country, no persons could
                            be<br/>engaged; and soon afterward the communications<br/>between the
                            white settlements and the Indians becoming<br/>almost intirely cut off,
                            our operations necessarily<br/>have been altogether suspended and the
                            committee<br/>have lately been informed that nearly the whole of the <pb facs="BYM_Page_256" n="256"></pb><br/>Indians at that place have abandoned their
                            settlement<br/>and been removed for safety amongst the white
                            people<br/>as it was believed their lives would be endangered
                            by<br/>remaining at their village</p>
<p>The committee may further inform that they<br/>received a visit during
                            the past apring from Quaita<br/>waippay (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/clewi2">Captain

                            obtaining<br/>some assistance for his Village and as we had
                            received<br/>satisfactory information of the Industry and
                            sober<br/>habits of these Indians, it was concluded to furnish<br/>them
                            some aid, and accordingly an order was given<br/>upon a member of our
                            committee who resides<br/>not very distant from his Village for a few
                            articles<br/>of Husbandry which have been prepared &amp; at his
                            request<br/>placed subject to his order in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/dayt">Dayton<placename key="dayt"></placename></a>, but the whole<br/>of the people of his Town
                            having been also removed<br/>for protection, amongst the white
                            Inhabitants, the<br/>Tools have not been taken possession of by him</p>
<p>From information received from those of our<br/>committee who were
                            appointed for the purpose of<br/>aiding the Indians residing on the
                            waters of the<br/><geogname key="muskr">Muskinghum river</geogname> it
                            appears that they had made<br/>them a visit much to their satisfaction,
                            having<br/>found the Indians industriously engaged in clearing
                            their<br/>lands for the purpose of planting &amp; sowing, but
                            the<br/>villages being remote from the residence of these
                            friends<br/>rendered it inconvenient to them personally to yield
                            the<br/>necessary care, they therefore engaged a suitable person<br/>in
                            the neighbourhood of the Villages to make the in <pb facs="BYM_Page_257" n="257"></pb><br/>
                            frequent visits, and advise and instruct them where<br/>it might appear
                            necessary. He was also authorized to<br/>furnish what for the purpose of
                            sowing to such of<br/>them as he might find disposed to cultivate it,
                            and<br/>upon the whole there was a good prospect of<br/>their making
                            considerable advances in the arts<br/>of civil life, since this account
                            however the committee<br/>have been informed, that owing to the
                            exasperated state<br/>of the public mind against the Indians throughout
                            that<br/>country, these towns have been destroyed and the
                            Indians<br/>compelled to seek refuge under the government of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a><br/>the committee have likewise received
                            information<br/>that the establishment which they heretofore
                            occupied<br/>on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> called
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/denn">Dennis' Station<placename key="denn"></placename></a>, has also<br/>been
                            destroyed, and their Houses burnt down; as<br/>at this place
                            considerable progress had been made<br/>by the Indians in Building and
                            cultivation and as<br/>many of them had discovrd a disposition
                            for<br/>civilization this event is much regreted</p>
<p>Situated as the committee now find the<br/>Indians generally Driven from
                            their habitations<br/>and their Country desolate, they are not of
                            opinion<br/>that in the present state of the public mind,
                            their<br/>labours can be of much avail, but the committee<br/>are
                            willing to hope that by continuing patiently<br/>under the concern, the
                            time may return, when they will<br/>be able to renew their efforts and
                            perhaps more efficiently<br/>than heretofore</p>

                            as were permited to re<br/>main at home were busily engaged on their
                            farms. He<br/>also states that the Mill which had been nearly

<p>The committee on Indian concerns report that<br/>since the last yearly
