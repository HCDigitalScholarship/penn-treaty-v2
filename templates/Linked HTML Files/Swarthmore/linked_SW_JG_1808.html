<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of this book, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                Notes of a Journey taken by Elisha Tyson &amp; James Gillingham on a Visit

                    entertainment good of the<br/>[delete: Fa] House orderly -- We were much
                    delighted<br/>with the Country between the Catocktin &amp;<br/>&amp; South
                    Mountains &amp; thought the <br/>appearance quite equal to that in
                    the<br/>neighborhood of Fredericktown [delete]<br/>the Village we are now
                    resting in has<br/>a very neat &amp; agreeable appearance<br/>&amp; appears to
                    be in thriving condition several new<br/>Brickhouses having been lately
                    built<br/>&amp; more are Building.</p>

                    re-<br/>flections were excited on passing the<br/>conochocheage Valley a Valley
                    perhaps in<br/>-ferior to none in the Luxuriance of the <br/>Soil but the
                    comparison in the tillage<br/>with the Valley we passed yesterday is <br/>as
                    much in favour of the former -- as there<br/>is difference between that
                    cultivated <br/>by neat Dutch Farmers &amp; that by <br/>negro Drivers the tints
                    of Distress &amp;<br/>Slavery being generally observable<br/>in our rout this

                    found plenty of the<br/>necessaries of Life. the Country<br/>here is very good.
                    with excellent<br/>Bottom &amp; upland the Prairies we<br/>have passed are
                    mostly rich but there<br/>is so little timber in many parts that<br/>they can
                    hardly be enclosed with Fences so</p>

                    provisions for our<br/>-selves, the lands in this rout are of <br/>an Excellent
                    Quality with a very Large <br/>growth of Timber interspersed with
                    abun<br/>-dance of Poplar but for some miles near<br/>Stanton the Growth of

                    began<br/>to rain so that that we had no<br/>Choice but to ride 40 miles
                    thro<br/>a very swampy Country. almost an<br/>entire level &amp; one swamp so
                    dark that<br/>we got thro with difficulty &amp; alarms in<br/>passing which

<p>not one House in the whole distance<br/>we arrived at Fort wayne in

                    very<br/>kind &amp; attentive we spent the evening<br/>in consulting about the

                    to the Fort for consulta-<br/>-tion &amp; after night had a Conference <br/>with
                    some of the Potowatomy Indians<br/>Winnemak a Chief informed us<br/>that he had

                    tools &amp; young men to teach <br/>them to Farm but had not done
                    there-<br/>-fore he was deceived</p>
<pb facs="SW_JG_1808_018" n="18"></pb>
<p>that he had set his mind upon it &amp; was much <br/>disappointed &amp; we found
                    it very difficult<br/>to remove he prejudices we stated that<br/>William Kirk
                    had come to their country<br/>last spring with an intention of assit-<br/>ing
                    them but that the Potowatomies<br/>and Miamies had refused to receive
                    him<br/>&amp; that he had to return back to the <br/>Shawenesse but he said that
                    he had <br/>received no account of his being here<br/>&amp; so had not refused
                    him &amp; throught<br/>that he can been neglected.</p>
<p>the country around Fort wayne is not<br/>of the First Quality [deleted: yet] but
                    on the<br/>other side of the River the land is<br/>good the situation of the
                    Fort is<br/>pleasant &amp; the prospect pretty<br/>good considering the flatness
                    of the<br/>Country Elisha &amp; myself lodged <br/>at Johnstons &amp; the others
                    at the <br/>Tavern</p>

<p>John Johnston was to accompany us<br/>to Dennis Station &amp;
                    Massasinneway<br/>but after Crossing the River to William<br/>Wallis's he could
                    not Find his<br/>Horse so we proceeded on &amp; he was <br/>to overtake us if
                    could get<br/>his Horse, but we arrived there<br/>alone &amp; John Flin came
                    there<br/>in the evening &amp; lodged with us<br/>at Shaw Griffiths</p>
<p>16 David's Horse having failed <br/>we received acct that the <br/>Massasinians
                    were drunk &amp; killing <br/>one another we let John go with<br/>-out us.
                    Elisha &amp; Benjamin Iddings <br/>arrived in Company with William<br/>Wells
                    about 3 OClock, Elisha was<br/>very much overcome with the Jour-<br/>-ney</p>
<p>17th - We Walked to the upper Village<br/>this morning visited the White loon</p>
<pb facs="SW_JG_1808_021" n="21"></pb>
<p>The Principal Chief and some others &amp;<br/>had some conversation with them
                    &amp;<br/>returned in the afternoon we went down<br/>the River about half a mile
                    below <br/>Dennis's Station &amp; visited the Eel River<br/>Indians The Indians
                    at both these <br/>Villages live in tolerable log houses<br/>Which were
                    generally built by Wells<br/>out of their annuities the amt of<br/>the Whole
                    Population of these Villages<br/>with Dennis's Station being about
                    300<br/>Tomorrow we have appointed to see the<br/>Indians together--</p>
<p>18th we heard this morning that several <br/>of the Indians of the Lower Village
                    were<br/>drinking which has a disagreeable feeling<br/>to us but hope they will
                    not Interrupt us<br/>in Council to day -- abut 12 OClock we<br/>met with the
                    Indians of the upper and Lower<br/>Villages &amp; also those at Dennis's Station
                    to<br/>whom we read the address (that was to have<br/>been taken out by John
                    Shaw &amp; Griffith &amp; found<br/>by us at Red Stone it having been to late in

<p>Some observations were also communicated<br/>by Elisha Tyson &amp; David Grave to
                    all which<br/>they gave their assent as is customary<br/>after Which the White
                    loon made a Short Speech<br/>acknowledging the propriety of what had<br/>been
                    said &amp; observed that as they expected to<br/>attend the Council at Fort
                    Wayne where <br/>a more pointed reply would be necessary<br/>he thought it
                    superfluous to say much<br/>at that time the Indians generally made<br/>a pretty
                    good appearance &amp; some had on<br/>very costly dresses. we returned to our
                    young<br/>mens Habitation &amp; Dined upon Beef killed<br/>the Evening before by
                    the Indians it was <br/>said partly on our account they manifested<br/>respect
                    for us &amp; partly good decorum at the<br/>time of our counselling together</p>
<p>We observe few or any of the young men<br/>at labour &amp; it appears doubtful
                    whether<br/>the present generation of young men will<br/>apply themselves to
                    Labour prejudice &amp;<br/>their habits of ease &amp; Indulgence being<br/>to
                    deeply Rooted in their minds</p>

<p>Shaw &amp; Griffith were preparing Ground for<br/>Planting Corn the weather had
                    been so wet<br/>for sometime back that the Ground could not<br/>be plowed to
                    advantage. the land Cleared<br/>at these Villages is about 100 Acres they
                    have<br/>about 120 Horse kind &amp; about 50 Horned<br/>Cattle &amp; a good many
                    Hogs the want of<br/>mas last Winter proved fatal to abundance <br/>of Swine I
                    do not find that Friends have<br/>any Hogs at the Station the land here<br/>as
                    well for 200 Miles down this River is<br/>Excellent &amp; would admit of
                    settlements suf-<br/>-ficient for all the Indians on this side the

                    many miles Higher<br/>We viewed the Mill Seat at Dennis<br/>Station on the River
                    which we pronounced<br/>a good one also Dennis's Creek a Large<br/>Branch but

<p>the Weather has been fine for 2 Days past but<br/>this Evening has a threatning
                    aspect so that it<br/>looks quite likely that we must either be
                    detained<br/>here or ride in the Rain tomorrow as usual<br/>the young men have
                    been handing out the <br/>corn to such as were in want but some of
                    the<br/>Indians having exprest their dissatisfaction<br/>we directed them to
                    give all the Corn they had<br/>to the Indians to be divided by them as
                    they<br/>saw meet &amp; a thought suggested itself to us<br/>that it would be as
                    well for whoever should<br/>be stationed here to spend the chief of their
                    <br/>time in assisting &amp; Instructing the Indians<br/>Instead of Raising Corn
                    to be given away</p>

                    some<br/>Friendly Conversation on the subject <br/>of our Mission Capt Welles

                    only a path thro<br/>thick bushes in places we concluded<br/>to lie by until

                    heavy<br/>rain</p>

                    so sent<br/>John Flin. J. Johnstons interpreter<br/>to give the Little Turtle

                    it is<br/>thought that it will not be possible<br/>to turn him from his purpose
                    we<br/>dread his company in Council as he<br/>does not appear to have any
                    more<br/>Idea of Civilization than the <br/>Bears in the Woods he puts<br/>me in

                    they say there <br/>is not one Indian in the Country<br/>that the Indians fear

                    hardly<br/>expected here the prospect is avery <br/>dull one as we are informed
                    that the<br/>Turtle &amp; five medals are our ene-<br/>-mies &amp; will oppose
                    us. The two Chiefs<br/>at the Wabash, the White Loon for the <br/>Masseseneway

<p>23. This being the day we had appointed<br/>for to hold a Council with the
                    Indians<br/>&amp; many of them were Collected over the river<br/>we were engaged
                    in preparing such<br/>communications to them as we thought<br/>advisible but to
                    our great Mortification<br/>we were informed that the son of the<br/>Five medals
                    had returned from Stanton<br/>where he had been with several men<br/>&amp;
                    Horses to purchase whiskey with a <br/>Large quantity &amp; that the Indians
                    here<br/>collected had got to drinking it &amp;<br/>were many of them drunk so
                    that the<br/>prospect looks gloomy &amp; that all our<br/>toil will be of no
                    avail</p>
<p>24 The contractor showed us this morn-<br/>-ing that in the month of April
                    last<br/>there was delivered by order of the<br/>Indian agent 1117 Rations of
                    Whiskey<br/>or about 35 Gallons The Contractor<br/>informed us that he offered
                    to furnish<br/>William kirk when in Friends employ<br/>[delete] Flour at $6 per
                    [Cut?]</p>
<pb facs="SW_JG_1808_032" n="32"></pb>
<p>The Indians are still drunk &amp; little<br/>prospect of doing any business
                    with<br/>them about nine o Clock the Indians that<br/>had come in came together
                    except Wapa-<br/>-kee who was too drunk the five Medals was so<br/>much
                    intoxicated with divers others,<br/>that we concluded it would not do<br/>to
                    pretend to treat with them &amp; but<br/>just to come together &amp; inform
                    them<br/>that we were sorry that they had been<br/>drinking so much as to be
                    unfit to talk<br/>with at Present but would meet<br/>them tomorrow morning when
                    if they<br/>were still drunk we would go away<br/>without having any public talk
                    with<br/>them -- The five Medals made reply<br/>that we might speak, as the
                    Potowa-<br/>-tomies were the only people that<br/>were drunk &amp; that they
                    were sober<br/>enough to listen to what we</p>
<pb facs="SW_JG_1808_033" n="33"></pb>
<p>had to say but did not wish to answer<br/>&amp; that they could go home tomorrow
                    &amp; did<br/>not care whether they heard what we have <br/>to say or not. &amp;
                    told Elisha that he<br/>was no Great Chief &amp; therefore did<br/>wrong to tell
                    the Indians that we<br/>would not treat with them if they were
                    drunk<br/>tomorrow when after a little more talk<br/>we separated to meet again
                    tomorrow<br/>-- morning--</p>
<p>25th the morning pleasant &amp; the sun<br/>Shining which has not been a

                    the Indians in Council<br/>amongst themselves in order to pre-<br/>-pare an
                    answer to our addresses --<br/>about 2 OClock they sent us word<br/>that they

<p>the Chiefs present that they were engaged<br/>in Business of more importance at
                    this<br/>time William Kirk was here last year<br/>that it was the same case with
                    them<br/>this spring -- &amp; that he did not think us authorized<br/>to
                    Question him upon that subject</p>
<p>after he had done the White Loon one <br/>of the Chiefs residing at Dennis's
                    Station<br/>made some observations respecting our<br/>young men residing amongst
                    them<br/>&amp; said he thought that by Working with<br/>the Indians in their own
                    Fields they<br/>would render them more essential<br/>service &amp; also
                    animadverted upon<br/>the Indian Corn that was to be distri-<br/>-buted among
                    the Indians this spring<br/>at the Station thinking it was a
                    little<br/>extraordinary that after being a great<br/>deal of Corn last fall
                    that there<br/>should be so little this spring when<br/>it was offered for a

                    some given to the Indians<br/>so that there was only about 50 Bushls--</p>

<p>26th. We had intended to set out this morning<br/>but there appeared to be a good
                    deal<br/>of Writing to do relative to our Mission<br/>&amp; John Johnston also
                    wished to send some-<br/>-thing of the Writing kind with us which was
                    not<br/>fully prepared -- in the course of the<br/>Day we had a good deal of
                    conversa-<br/>-tion with Wells we were very plain<br/>with him, which he took in
                    good<br/>part &amp; endeavoured to explain or ex-<br/>-cuse. we plainly saw the
                    Difficulty<br/>of his situation &amp; were nearly ready <br/>to conclude that he
                    was determined <br/>to act uprightly. we think if he<br/>was Faithful agreeably
                    to his ability<br/>he would still be of use in his<br/>Station. We also had a
                    good deal<br/>of conversation with the White<br/>Loon respecting Whiskey. he
                    seemed<br/>very sensible of the bad consequences<br/>attend[delete: ed]ant upon
                    drinking &amp; made<br/>some very good observations upon</p>

<p>the subject comparing it to the throwing<br/>firebrands among the Family &amp;
                    made <br/>the Women run to hunt shelter some-<br/>-where else but seemed very
                    doubtful<br/>of having firmness enough to resist<br/>the temptation --</p>
<p>27th. Rode to Fort Wayne through a<br/>Steady days rain &amp; very deep Roads
                    &amp; ar-<br/>-rived at the St. Mary's at Stephen <br/>Youngs about sun setting
                    &amp; Crossed <br/>over in a Canoe swimming our<br/>Horses. we let our Horses
                    run loose in<br/>as fine grass as is common to see. it<br/>was spear grass &amp;
                    would have mowed<br/>a good Swarth. here is a proof of In-<br/>-dian Industry.
                    William Kirk last<br/>Spring Built a House and Cleared a Corn field<br/>for this

                    first day is gloomy in the<br/>extreme but Elisha &amp; David seem<br/>intent to
                    go to Wapakunetah the town<br/>where William Kirk lives contrary <br/>to my
