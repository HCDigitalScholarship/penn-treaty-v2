<p>The Rachel Coope manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed this manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: Miriam Lise Hauser. Transcriptions were compiled and
                    edited in the present form by Professor Murray. </p>
</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>Journals "a" and "b" represent transcriptions of Rachel Coope’s actual diaries.
                    Journal "a" her “esteemed parents”; however, her mother died before the letter
                    was written, and so it may have been meant for her parents­in­law, to whom she
                    was deeply attached) copied over twice. No version of this letter is included in
                    journal four. Except for this, the differences were small, such as variance in
                    phrasing and spelling, and not in content. It seems as though journal "a"
                    preceded journal "b"; it is less polished. The handwriting seems more rushed and
                    the paper size varies, while in journal "b", the handwriting is neater, and the
                    paper used is consistent. It is possible that these, especially journal three,
                    could have been handwritten by Coope.</p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<salute>My dear Parents,</salute></opener>
<p>About two weeks<br/> ago I wrote to you and sent it by an Indi-<br/>an that was
                    going to <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> for<br/>the things they
                    Committee has sent<br/>for us, in which I promised to give a<br/>more full
                    account of our Journey by<br/><a href="/people/jembr1">Jm. Embree<persname key="jembr1"></persname></a> when
                    he returned, and<br/>I feel myself so indebted to Father, as<br/>renders it
                    requesite for me to com-<br/>ply with his request, but on looking<br/>over the
                    notes which I have kept,<br/>seeing how unperfectly they are, it has
                    al-<br/>most discouraged my attempting, for<br/>I cannot concieve they will be
                    any way<br/>entertaing, excepting a little bare infor-<br/>mation, I often feel
                    myself very defecti[ve]<br/>in literary knowledge, and my Ideas<br/>in matters
                    of Consequence, much con-<br/>tained, let those whose genius are<br/>more
                    bright, have Charity, and ac-<br/>cept, dear Father, my
                    communication<br/>flowing from the Sincerity of the heart<br/>

<unclear>that</unclear> it is not human literature, or<br/>the acquirements of

                    Spirit. I frequent-<br/>ly look towards my native home, with<br/>longing desires
                    to hear from you, not<br/>having heard a Word from Chester County<br/>Since we
                    left there. My dear <a href="/people/bcoop1">B.<persname key="bcoop1"></persname></a> has not<br/>been very

                    House<br/>about two weeks before we came, which<br/>when finished will be a very

                    of our journey by <a href="/people/wembr1">Wm Embree<persname key="wembr1"></persname></a>, and I felt myself
                    so in<br/>-debted to father as rendered it requisite for me to comply
                    with<br/>his request, but looking over, and seeing how imperfect<del>ly</del>
                    it<br/>was, almost discouraged me attempting, for I cannot con<br/>-cieve it
                    will be any way entertaining excepting a lit<br/>-tle bare information. I often
                    feel myself very defective<br/>in literary knowledge and my Ideas in matters of

                    rendering thanks to their<br/>gracious benefactor. I salute you all in near

                    tied it up<br/>again, &amp; proceeding along crossed a lively<br/>stream of

<p>Brothers Attend -<br/>You know we have of-<br/>-ten talked to you about
                            opening a<br/>good road from this town to <a href="/places/tunes">Tunesas-sah<placename key="tunes"></placename></a> in order to make it more easy
                            for<br/>your people to come to mill, if you<br/>will now join together,
                            and open this<br/>road, we have concluded to give you<br/> 7000 thousand
                            feet of boards; This will<br/>enable you to finish your houses, to<br/>
                            have them warm against next<br/>winter</p>

                            you<br/>were making sugar. we will continue<br/>to grind for you untill
                            the next sea-<br/>son for sugar,making, without<br/>taking toll which
                            will make one<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805a_Page_32" n="32"></pb>year. And if any
                            of you want<br/>boards we will sell them to you<br/>for four shillings
                            per hundred but<br/>we dont intend to trust any,<br/>because we want to
                            keep the chain of<br/>friendship bright. And if you<br/> want any of
                            your own logs saw<br/>ed into boards or scan thing, <del>if</del> to
                            do<br/>your own buildings. if you cut<br/>and haul the logs to the

<p>Brothers <gap></gap> These advantages which<br/>we now propose to you, are
                            in-<br/> tended to encourage you to pursue ha<br/>bits of industry and

                            path, then we think<br/>your substance will increase, and<br/>the great
                            spirit will bless your<br/>labours.</p>
<p>Brothers We don't want to tire<br/>your ears with many words but<br/>it
                            affords us much satisfaction<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805a_Page_33" n="33"></pb>to see your industry This spring in<br/> enclosing so many fields to

                            spiritous liquors,<br/>we repeat it again be strong in<br/> your minds
                            against this great<br/>enemy and never let him rise up<br/>again. We
                            have all united our <del>mind</del><br/>minds <del>in</del> together in
                            this speech<br/>and shall deliver you a copy <del>that</del><br/>in

<p>I felt satisfaction in being there<br/><a href="/people/jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> says he has felt<br/>more peace in attending some<br/>of
                    their counsils than any<br/> quarterly meeting; but it will<br/>take us some
                    time to get a little<br/> acquainted with their language.</p>
<p>About 30 of the Indians has since join<br/>ed together and opened the road
                    which<br/>will be an advantage to us as well<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805a_Page_34" n="34"></pb> them, a grand piece of work for<br/>Indians, it
                    being done completely</p>
<p><a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> did not attend<br/>the counsil but
                    has been here since<br/>I did not deliver thy message for<br/>want of an
                    interpreter <a href="/people/jtayl1">J Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a><br/>said he thought he
                    could not make<br/>him understand which was thee.<br/>there was a paragraft in
                    the addres<br/>from the committee sent by us<br/>refering that when any of
                    them<br/>has done any thing another does not<br/>like, they should not differ
                    but<br/>forgive him that does wrong<br/>for the good spirit forgives<br/> as
                    when we <del>are</del> do wrong if we are horror for it</p>
<p>I know not but <del>whether it had not</del><br/>it had a good effect for about
                    two<br/>days after they calld a counsil, sent<br/>for <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and made up<br/>all the uneasiness, and
                    restord<br/>him to his former power, he<br/>has since<br/><pb facs="SW_RC1805a_Page_35" n="35"></pb> been here and he said he told them when<br/>any
                    thing happened among them<br/>in future they had better try to<br/>make it up
                    among themselvs, and<br/>not go and tell it abroad over<br/>the country for that
                    made it worse<br/>he also told us some more advise he<br/>gave them, which I
                    thought very just<br/><del>in regard to such trifals</del> and said<br/>the old
                    friends down the country<br/>might be inform'd that the differ<br/>ence was all
                    done away and there<br/>was nothing between us the quakers and them.</p>
<p>It was very agreeable news to hear<br/><a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> was restored, for his<br/>judgment in matters, was
                    of <del>some</del><br/> consequence, he wanted to <del>see</del> see some<br/>of
                    our linen or manufacturing,<br/>and said <del>he tho</del> if one or two of<br/>
                    their women could get in the way<br/>they could learn the other</p>
