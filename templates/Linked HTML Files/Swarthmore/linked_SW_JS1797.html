<p>The manuscript of Joshua Sharpless’ “Journal [Visit to Upper Canada and Parts
                    Adjacent]” (1797) is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of
                    Swarthmore College. In the spring semester of 2012, Swarthmore students enrolled
                    in English 57A (“Early American Literature Through A Traveler’s Eyes”)
                    transcribed Sharpless’s manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker journal writings more accessible to researchers.
                    The project was designed by Christopher Densmore, curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Associate Professor of English. Transcribers
                    included: David Fialkow (1-14), Epiphany English (15-42), Keat Murray (43-51),
                    and Sarah Scheub (52-87). Students’ transcriptions were compiled and edited in
                    the present form by Professor Murray.</p>
</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p>Because the manuscript does not include page numbers, the transcribers have
                    interpolated page numbers. The transcribers and editor attempted to render
                    Sharpless’s orthography and grammar as they appear on the page of his journal,
                    even when Sharpless’s own spelling and usage are inconsistent. </p>

<pb facs="SW_JS1797_Page_03" n="3"></pb> with an elegant Valley between, the

                    passed through <br/>a gap where a small branch of <br/>the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> has it course, the gap <br/>in places was narrow, and

                    <br/>crossed the <geogname key="tusca">Tuscarora Mountain</geogname>, <br/>on
                    the North Side of which there is <br/>an amazing prospect, a very <br/>great

                    reach, about 2 or three miles <br/>off over said Valley there was a <br/>lofty

<br/>was called the <geogname key="lmoun">little Mountain</geogname>
<br/>tho thought to be higher then any <br/>of the rest, the Assent and decent

<p> to up very early and set off as soon<br/> as we could see the path, in hopes of
                    a pretty <br/>pleasant day, the sun made its appearance <br/>about 9 or 10 yet

                    <br/>is mostly deep rich soil, and wet, much <br/>of the way was very swampy, so
                    that be-<br/>-tween the snow and the Mud, we were <br/>in a wet dirty condition,

                    without Shelter looked very try-<br/>-ing, yet we went on pretty Chearful,

                    sufficiently secured from the Storm, <br/>have upon viewing it we concluded to

                    or Beding, more <br/>than what a Rock afforded, yet we com-<br/>-forted our

                    our <br/>Horses, as for ourselves, the Woods afford<br/>-ed but little
                    provision, and that was cover-<br/>-ed with Snow, so that after giving them<br/>
                    some Corn, we tyed them up till Morning <br/>and Changing some of our Wet
                    Clothes, we <br/>endeavoured to take some rest, and <br/>tho it was Cold, we
                    Lodged more com-<br/>-fortable than could be expected, slept <br/>pretty well,
                    took little or no cold, and <br/>set our Journey chearfully next Morn-<br/>-ing

                    about four Miles travel-<br/>-ing we were disappointed, for we came <br/>upon a

<p>a blustry night, but pretty pleasant<br/> Morning, all in health, and wit an

                    Com<br/>fort them, leting them know they were <br/>nearly through, where there
                    was provi-<br/>-sion to be had, and for an immediate <br/>relief spared them a

                    fordable, but on our <br/>arrival our hopes appeared frustrat<br/>-ed, for it
                    was very high and appeard <br/>still to be rising, and it was too wide <br/>to

                    family, being <br/>a Man and his Wife, and five small <br/>Children, two of whom
                    rode with the Mother <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1797_Page_64" n="64"></pb> one with the Father on a large pack
                    <br/>of something, and who by themselves, <br/>some of them were without
                    Stockings Cold as <br/>it was, to see that those in their distressed, <br/>much
                    helpless, and Cumbred condition, <br/>had surmounted all the difficulties
                    <br/>as to badness of Road, &amp;c that were before <br/>us, we felt our hearts
                    animated, to pursue our Journey and I <br/>thought we had no cause in our well
                    <br/>provided <del>state</del> condition to entertain the least<br/>
                    discouragement, the family above noted <br/>had lain in the Woods last night
                    without<br/> any Camp, the Ground five Inches deep <br/>with snow, and the
                    weather so Cold that<br/> abundance of Ice was floating on the <br/>Waters we
                    had lately Crossed, and they would <br/>have to encounter the same trials this
                    <br/>Night as they could reach no house. </p>

<p> set off as soon <del>this Morning</del>
<br/>as was safe, in hopes we should be able <br/>to reach a friends House this
                    Evening, <br/>which was very desirable, the Morning <br/>was Cloudy and very
                    Cold, and we had a <br/>rough high Country for 10 miles to travel<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1797_Page_65" n="65"></pb> over, on which there were <del>three</del>
                    two remarkable <br/>eminences the first was so thickly enclosed <br/>with
                    Hemlock that it afforded very little<br/> Prospect, beneath our feet, tho
                    through some openings the top of the mountains around appeared the other was
                    Just as <del>you</del> we be-<br/>-gan to defend from off the <geogname key="laure">Lawrel Hill</geogname>. <br/>This Prospect was truly grand, we
                    appeared <br/>to be above the tops of the <geogname key="allem">Allegenies</geogname>, which <br/>rose up in a very romantick and wild
                    <br/>appearance, the View was very extensive <br/>and these ellevations being
                    white with snow appeared to be almost <br/>without Timber, so that with the help
                    of fan-<br/>-cy they looked like improved Farms, hav-<br/>-ing many places the
                    appearance of square <br/>Fields, with hedge rows, and divisions, but <br/>I
                    have no expectation that these inhospital<br/> regions will ever be <del>a</del>
                    the habitation of man <del>for any</del><br/><del>thing</del> but for the Wild
                    Beasts of the Forest and the <br/>Fowls of the Air, fed at the

                        hill</geogname> 9 miles in the snow, there being no house, here our
                    <br/>Road led us down a beautiful Branch of the <br/><geogname key="lycom">Lycoming</geogname> tho very much choaked with <br/>drift wood, some of our
                    company had the <br/>curiosity to count how many times we <br/>crossed it in
                    eight miles, where it united <br/>with the main branch, and the made it about
                    <br/>28 <del>times</del>, and the <geogname key="lycom">Lycoming</geogname>
                    itself we Crossed<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1797_Page_66" n="66"></pb> perhaps ten times more, these waters make
                    <br/>a brake through what is called the <geogname key="allem">Allegenies</geogname>
<br/>and the vale in many places, particularly be-<br/>fore we come to the main
                        <geogname key="lycom">stream</geogname>, is not more <br/>than 8 or 10
                    pearches Wide and the <geogname key="allem">Mountains</geogname>
<br/>rise on each hand remarkably high &amp; steep <br/>so that our traveling
                    was almost litterally<br/> sneaking under the Hills and Mountains, fed at
                        <br/><a href="/people/jkyle1">Kyle’s<persname key="jkyle1"></persname></a> 10 miles here we got our
                    dinner, hav-<br/>-ing Bear Meat and Veneson fryed up to<br/>gether, Tea without
                    sugar, with good Wheat <br/>Bread &amp; Butter, in nine Miles from hence <br/>we
                    finally left the <geogname key="lycom">Lycoming</geogname> a beautiful
                    <br/>Stream, we thought about as large as two <br/>of <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>, and in six Miles we <br/>Crossed the <geogname key="loyal">Loyalsock</geogname> a lovely stream, per-<br/>-haps nearly as
                    large as two of <geogname key="lycom">Lycomon</geogname>

                    <br/>without any sheet over us, but in lieu thereof <br/>a Rough Course Blanket,
                    our meal has been <br/>steadily fryed Veneson sometimes pretty good, <br/>our
                    Bread for 100 <gap></gap> miles, with some small <br/>exceptions, has been
                    indifferent Buckwhea[t] <br/>cakes, our drink almost ever since we <br/>left

                    Sugar, as their <br/>store holds out, they have a great Plenty of <br/>Sugar
                    Maple, of which some of the Inhabi-<br/>-tants make a sufficiency for themselves
                    <br/>but we found a number of them out, not<br/>withstanding this was their

                    down with as much composure as <br/>if all were compleat, which I counted <br/>a
