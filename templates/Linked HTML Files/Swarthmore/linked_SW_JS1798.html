<p>The manuscript of Joshua Sharpless’s “Journal into Indian Country, (1798) is
                    housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of Swarthmore College. In
                    the spring semester of 2012, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 57A (“Early
                    American Literature Through A Traveler’s Eyes”) transcribed Sharpless’s
                    manuscript as part of a larger project to make the library’s rich store of
                    Quaker journal writings more accessible to researchers. The project was designed
                    by Christopher Densmore, curator of Friends Historical Library, and Keat Murray,
                    Visiting Associate Professor of English. Transcribers included: Kara Stoever
                    (3-38), Kari Olmon (39-74), Zach Wunrow (75-87, 153-174), Margaret Duszyk
                    (88-104), Roberto Conreras (105-123), and David Fialkow (124-152). Students’
                    transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by Professor Murray.
                </p>

<p>The transcribers and editor attempted to render Sharpless’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when Sharpless’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Because the manuscript does not include
                    page numbers, the transcribers have interpolated page numbers.</p>
<p>[See the “Visit to the Indians in 1798,” published in The Friend beginning in 9
                    Mo. 25, 1847, p. 5 and following. This seems to be a variation with some
                    omissions and numerous minor changes of the Sharpless journal. C.D.]</p>

                    fields,<br/> which for want of better farming were<br/> very bare of pasture.
                    fed at the Black horse<br/> 14 miles, thence to <a href="/places/shipp">Shippensburgh<placename key="shipp"></placename></a> 12 miles,<br/> part of which was through a flat
                    Pine bottom<br/> containing a large number of Ponds of stag-<br/> -nated Water,
                    but as we advanced nearer<br/> the Town, we passed through high Cham-<br/> -pion

                    miles after we left the town we passed through<br/> a beautiful well improved
                    Limestone Coun-<br/> -try, thence through land not so desirable<br/> to
                        <a href="/places/stras">Strawsburgh<placename key="stras"></placename></a>, a Village containing

                    eminence, steep and very Rocky,<br/> in about three Miles we arrived at the<br/>
                    bottom of the Opposite side, where we<br/> Crossed the main branch of <geogname key="conod">Conedogwine</geogname><br/> and took up our Quarters at

<p> Set of early, we immediately asscened<br/> another Mountain much like our
                    last,<br/> when we arrived at its Summit we had<br/> a delightful View of a well

                    lofty Mountain beyond, Just as we ente-<br/> -red this Valley, we Crossed the

                    stream, in about half<br/> a Mile we passed through <a href="/places/fanne">Phanetts-Burgh<placename key="fanne"></placename></a>
<br/> a Village of perhaps 30 Loghouses, shortly af-<br/> -ter we
                        <del>crossed</del> passed this Town we ascend-<br/> -ed a third Mountain
                    much like the two<br/> last discribed, from thence to Birds at <a href="/places/flitt">fort Littleton<placename key="flitt"></placename></a> 5 miles, through a rough
                    Country, <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_009" n="7"></pb> Surrounded with lofty Mountains, some<br/>
                    pretty good improvements in places made<br/> there appearance, and the Roads
                    consider<br/> -ing the Roughness of the Country not to be<br/> complained of,
                    here we got our Breakfast<br/> 12 miles. from thence to <a href="/people/gskin1">Skinners<persname key="gskin1"></persname></a> on the<br/> top of <geogname key="sidel">Sidling
                        hill</geogname> 11 miles, through a rough,<br/> Broken, poor Country, very
                    little inhabited.<br/>
<geogname key="sidel">Sidling hill</geogname> a lofty Mountain; 7 miles
                    carried<br/> us over, we made near four miles on its<br/> Summit, which was very
                    high, but our<br/> prospect not extensive by reason of some<br/> mountains which
                    was nearby on each<br/> hand, as we began to descend a noble<br/> view
                    presented, as far as the Eye could<br/> reach, having the <geogname key="allmo">Allegeny Mountain</geogname> in<br/> full view at 20 or more miles distant,
                    the<br/> extensive prospect between, looked like<br/> a delightful plain,
                    Chequered with a few<br/> plantations, but when we came to tra-<br/> -verse it,
                    we found many lofty hills, or<br/> Mountains, particularly about the <geogname key="junia">Juni-<br/> -atta River</geogname>, one Branch of which we<br/>
                    Crossed, which was some 50 or so yards wide<br/> and more than Belly deep;
                    directly upon <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_010" n="8"></pb> Crossing this stream we ascended the<br/>
                    Steepest hill we have met with since we<br/> left home, it is admirable that so
                    many<br/> Wagons which pass this road, should be able to get<br/> up it, I
                    suppose we have passed by 20 this<br/> this day, mostly with families going to
                    new<br/> Countries, a number of which were Crowded<br/> with Children; 17 people
                    of different descrip-<br/> -tions belonged to one wagon. — when I view-<br/> -ed

                    very backward the Trees<br/> were, when we left home they were putting<br/> out

                    morning<br/> we remarked the buds of the Chesnut and<br/> White Oak were not
                    formed into leaves so<br/> as to make an appearance, yet the same<br/> day as we

                    were all green, the sight was<br/> so Curious, and different from our late
                    pros-<br/> -pect, that I measured some Chesnutt leaves<br/> and found them to be
                    3 Inches wide, and<br/> Six long, and sprouts of 8 or 9 Inches growth.<br/> So

                    the<br/> West, and to the South, I had no doubt but the View<br/> was of 50
                    miles extent, it was not so de-<br/> lightful as some I have seen, for want of
                    a<br/> lofty mountain rising 10 or more miles in<br/> front, but it was
                    Chequered with many Plan-<br/> -tations: in every direction, the View look<br/>
                    -ed like an extensive plain, but when<br/> we came to the traverse it, we found
                    many<br/> Steep Hills, <del>but</del> tho no Mountain; neither is<br/> there any

                    the stream was small,<br/> but had a natural perpendicular fall over <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_015" n="13"></pb> a broad Rock which lay Horizontal

                    some Oates for our horses, and let them<br/> pick a little in the Woods, but we
                    found<br/> a great Change since we left Redstone, the<br/> Season is abundantly
                    backwards; the<br/> leaves are but Just putting out, and there<br/> is next to

                    jumped our horses over. When<br/> we arrived on the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> we stopped a while<br/> to let our horses eat grass, there
                    being a great<br/> plenty on some of its bottoms, which was<br/> a pleasing
                    sight, and had a tendency to re-<br/> -move some fears, which attended when in

                    rare to see a Squirel in the<br/> Wilderness, we saw some pheasants, but no<br/>

                        <del>and</del> he presently <del>we had some</del><br/>
<del>Dinner</del> brought in some dinner in a bark bowl, and<br/> a Tin kettle,
                    the bowl was placed on the<br/> seat beside us, and the kettle on the
                    ground<br/> before us, and we were invited to eat, we<br/> saw the bowl, and the
                    kettle, but what<br/> was in either of them we knew not, or<br/> whether they
                    were to be eaten together, or<br/> separate, the bowl contained a number of<br/>
                    round lumps of something tied in Corn<del>hu</del><br/> -husks, two dumplings
                    were tyed in one<br/> set of husks, with a string at each end<br/> and in the
                    middle, we let them know that our<br/> Ignorance was such, we did not know
                    how<br/> to begin, which set some of the younger sort <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_040" n="38"></pb> a laughing, but the Chief took<br/> out
                    his knife, for they had set neither knives,<br/> forks, or spoons, and taking up
                    the<br/> Dumplins he cut one of them in too,<br/> then striping up the
                    Cornhusks, <del>with</del><br/>
<del>his knife</del> he cut off a piece of the dump<br/> -lin, and
                        <del>and</del>
<del>which</del> diped it <del>it</del> in the Kettle, which<br/> we found
                        <del>after</del> contained Bears Oyl, and<br/> eat it, we followed the
                    example, and made<br/> a light meal, the Bears Oyl was Cold and<br/> not
                    grateful to our Pallates, but we have<br/>
<del>seen</del> since, seen this way of eating is often prac-<br/> -ticed among
                    them; the Cold Indian Bread<br/> dipped in the Oyl is more frequently used.</p>

<p> Last evening after we had lain down to<br/> rest, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and his son <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a><br/> came into our apartment , and informed

<del>us from</del> the Indian Committee which <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_041" n="39"></pb> particularly pointed out our

                    nor understand English, <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a> was our<br/>
                    enterpretter on all occations whilst a-<br/> -mongst them, he was not ready, and

                    expressing his satisfaction<br/> on seeing us coming riding through the
                    bushes,<br/> and that it was the good spirit which preserv-<br/> -ed us in our
                    long journey, for which they were<br/> very glad. He then informed us of their
                    Poverty, the<br/> poorness of their houses which were covered with<br/> bark,
                    and their inability to make good ones, we<br/> thought the latter part of this
                    speech was calculat-<br/> -ed to draw our Charity. he then let us know<br/>
<del>that</del> they were all met <del>that</del> who were <del>were</del>
                    likely to attend,<br/> that their Women could not come, but the Men<br/> would
                    let them know what we said to them: we<br/>
<del>had</del> having particularly requested their Women might at-<br/> -tend.
                    We then opened our business by letting <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_042" n="40"></pb> them know the love of their Old Friends
                    the<br/> Quakers have for them, and our willingness<br/> to take a long Journey
                    to see them, some of us<br/> having left Loving Wives, and tender Child-<br/>
                    -ren, with Comfortable dwellings, and ex-<br/> -posed ourselves to the hardships
                    and difficulties of a<br/> perilous Journey, with no other view than<br/> for
                    their improvement. We then read the E-<br/> -pistle or instrumental of writing
                    the Committee sent,<br/> which particularly opened the design, and cause<br/> of
                    our coming amongst them, it was read by para-<br/> -graphs and interpreted with
                    some difficulty.<br/> We next read <a href="/people/gwilk2">General
                        Wilkinson<persname key="gwilk2"></persname></a>’s letter, then<br/> droped some advice, wishing them,

                    against discouragements, that might<br/> present, in their looking forward,
                    towards<br/> a change in their manner, of living for we did not<br/> doubt but
                    there might be many difficultie<br/> in their way, and their progress might be
                    slow<br/> yet there are accounts in the Writings<br/> amongst the White people,
                    of a people who<br/> lived beyond the great waters, in an-<br/> -other Island,

                    Town, and that was <del>e</del><br/> enough to draw one Plough, and

                    as<br/> the day was far spent, left it with them to<br/> Judge whether this

                    the<br/> substance of his speech.</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<p> Brothers the Quakers, <br/> Listen <del>no</del> now to what I<br/> am
                            going to say to you. – You know<br/> brothers the Red people are poor,
                            the great<br/> Spirit has made them of another language,<br/> so that it
                            is very hard for us to understand<br/> one another plainly, as there is
                            no person<br/> here that can interpret very well. <br/> Brothers, <br/>
                            we take great pains to settle<br/> the proposals you made to us, but we
                            differ<br/> in Opinions, and we must take great<br/> pains to have every
                            thing compleat <br/> Brothers,<br/> we suppose the reason you came
                            here<br/> was to help Poor Indians some way or other,<br/> and you wish
                            the Chiefs to tell their Warriors<br/> not to go on so bad as the have
                            done, and<br/> you wish us to take up work like the white<br/> People,
                            now Brothers some of our sober men<br/> will take take up work, and do
                            as you say,<br/> and if the do well, then will your young<br/> Men stay
                            longer, but some others will not<br/> mind what you say <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_046" n="44"></pb> Brothers,<br/> we cant say a word
                            against you<br/> it is the best way to call Quakers Brothers.<br/> You
                            never wished our lands, you never<br/> wished any part of our Lands,
                            therefore we are<br/> determined to try to learn your ways, and<br/>
                            those young men may stay here two years<br/> to try, by that time we
                            shall know whether<br/> Morris will leave us any land, for last
                            summer<br/> we sold our Land, and we dont know yet<br/> whether we shall
                            get what we reserved, or<br/> wether we shall get our Money, but by
                            that<br/> time we shall know, and then if they like<br/> it, and we like
                            it, your young men may<br/> stay longer.<br/> Brothers,<br/> if your
                            young Men stay here we<br/> want them to lern our Children to read<br/>
                            and Write. <br/> Brothers,<br/> Two of you are going home<br/> again, if
                            the hear any thing about our land,<br/> or our Money, they must write to
                            these young<br/> men here, and the must tell us if we are<br/> like to
                            be Cheated.<br/> Brothers,<br/> this is all I have yet to say.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> We exchanged our satisfaction with their an-<br/> -swer and let them know our
                    young <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_047" n="45"></pb> Men would want a house to live in, and
                    a<br/> piece of good Land to work, that so they<br/> may be able to raise their
                    bread. For<br/> which purpose we <del>wanted</del> desired some of their<br/>
                    Chiefs would <del>to</del> go with us, to look about their Coun-<br/> -try, and
                    conclude where would be most ad-<br/> -vantageous to the nation for our

<p> we had some conversati-<br/> -on this morning about sitting together<br/> in "
                    religious retirement, and thought<br/> it would be right to inform <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>,<br/> that if he or any of his sober
                    people<br/> enclined to set with us it would be ac-<br/> -ceptable, tho the
                    prospect of such an<br/> undertaking felt weighty, before we were<br/> fully
                    concluded, the Chief with his son<br/> Henry came in to our appartment, and<br/>
                    said he hoped we would not think hard <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_048" n="46"></pb> at their not keeping the first day
                    as<br/> the white do, for they could not read<br/> and Write, that they were

                    intended about 10 OClock to sit down<br/> together in stillness to wait on
                    the<br/> great spirit, and if he or any of his<br/> sober people would come and
                    set with<br/> us it would be acceptable. near the<br/> time appointed <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> with seve-<br/> -ral other came into our

                    a weighty consideration of making<br/> this the place of settlement, there
                    are<br/> also a large number of Children here<br/> fit for schooling, so that
                    with much con-<br/> -veniency a large school might be<br/> made up, but to
                    ballance these advan-<br/> -tages, we considered the Land was pri-<br/> -vet
                    property, and if we made improv-<br/> -ments , such as building a house and<br/>
                    Barn, and Cleared land, when we left<br/> it they would all belong to <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplan- -ter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, and not to the nation; also if
                    the<br/> Indians where to clear land and fence<br/> lots, they would not belong
                    to the Nati-<br/> -on. this consideration made us believe<br/> it would be best
                    to look elsewhere. – <br/> The Nation owns 42 Square miles on this <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_050" n="48"></pb>
<geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>, beginning at the <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a><br/> Line, the lines of the reservation is<br/>
                    not yet Run, but we found the Indians<br/> have a choice that it should ly on the<br/>
<geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>, half a mile wide on each side.<br/>
                    about 9 miles from hence up the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> lat-<br/>
                    -terly stood a Town called <a href="/places/genes1">Genesinguh-

                    mostly removed here,<br/> about 10 miles further up the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> we<br/> understood a settlement had latterly<br/> been
                    made, from the best information<br/> we could get, thought somewhere a-<br/>
                    -bout the <a href="/places/genes1">Old Town<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> would be the most<br/>
                    suitable place to fix on, it being about<br/> half way between the upper
                    settlement and<br/> lower Town, according with consider-<br/> -able exertion
                    about 9 OClock we got <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplan- -ter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, his
                    son <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a>, and three other<br/> Indians to
                    embark with us five in<br/> a Canoe, they put us up the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> with<br/> setting Poles at the Rate of 3 miles an
                    hour.<br/> in places the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> was Shallow
                    and<br/> ran rapid, in other places from two<br/> to six feet deep, we pased by
                    a num-<br/> -ber of Islands, some pretty large, which<br/> appeared rich, were
                    grown over with grass<br/> and other herbage very luxuriant, the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_051" n="49"></pb> flats on each side of the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> appeared<br/> much of the same quality, tho
                    none of them<br/>
<del>appeared</del> were wide; in about 6 miles we<br/> came to <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> sawmill, we stop-<br/> -ed at his
                    request and viewed it, the<br/> Mill is almost new, built on a Small<br/>
                    Stream, which when we were there<br/> was so low that the Mill could do
                    very<br/> little work, and at the time of Year <del>that</del><br/> the Stream
                    is pretty full, the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> is<br/> often so high
                    that it hurts the mill with<br/> its backwater, in about three miles fur-<br/>
                    -ther up the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> we came to the <a href="/places/genes1">Old Town<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, three or more families yet re-<br/>
                    -main here, we thought there might be<br/> 150 or more acres of a flat that has
                    been<br/> mostly cleared and worked with Corn,<br/> part of which is grown up
                    with Hazels<br/> &amp;c and part with grass, that in a few <del>wee</del><br/>
                    weeks would do to mow, and some of the<br/> richest sorts of it are put in
                    with<br/> Corn this Spring; it doth not appear to<br/> have ever been fenced,
                    and at certain<br/> stretches <del>it</del> is mostly subject to an overflow.<br/>
<del>it</del> the tract lies on the Northwest side of the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>.<br/> the flat is about 40 reaches wide, and then <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_052" n="50"></pb> commences Timber Land, mostly White<br/>
                    Pine, suitable for building, or Railtim-<br/> -ber, which Timberland within 60
                    perch-<br/> -es of the flat we thought pretty good, lies<br/> very well to the
                    sun, with a gentle Assent,<br/> and clear of stones; when Viewing this<br/>
                    land, and taking its local situation in<br/> -to consideration, we were united
                    in<br/> believing, that somewhere <del>about</del> near<br/> this place would be
                    best to make our<br/> settlement; upon informing two of the Chiefs<br/> who bore
                    us company, that we thought<br/> across the upper end of the cleared flat
                    from<br/> the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> back, taking in part of the
                    Wood-<br/> -land, would be suitable for our purpose,<br/> and that if they liked
                    it, to tell us, and if the did not<br/> like it, tell us so, and we would look
                    farther<br/> where it would suit them better, they said the<br/> had informed us
                        <del>that</del> all their Land was be-<br/> -fore us and that we might take
                    it where we liked <del>it</del><br/> best, and expressed their full
                    satisfaction<br/> with our choice, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
                    then said, this man,<br/> meaning one of the Chiefs that was with us,<br/> lives
                    in this <a href="/places/genes1">Town<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, and he is like one of<br/>
<del>us, he</del> you, a sober man, &amp; drinks no Whiskey, and he is very<br/>
                    glad <del>our</del> the young men are coming to live <del>a-</del><br/>
<del>-mongst them</del> so near him. We informed the Chiefs that<br/> our Young
                    men would want timber for <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_053" n="51"></pb> to build a House, for Rails, and for
                    fire-<br/> -Wood, to which they readily consented, say-<br/> -ing, they would be
                    very glad they would cut<br/> all the Trees down, and further Liberty<br/> they
                    would give them, if they saw a Buck<br/> swimming across the River, or
                    running<br/> through the Woods they might shoot him<br/> or if they saw any fish
                    in the River they<br/> might <del>cath</del> catch them, we then returned<br/>
                    down the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> with <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> to his <a href="/places/cornp">Village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>

<p> This Morning resumed the consideration of what farther pro-<br/> -positions we
                    should make to these people<br/> in order to their additional encourag-<br/>
                    -ment in Civilization and Aggreculture,<br/> and mutually agreed upon some,
                    which will<br/> be inserted in their proper place. –-</p>
<p> This afternoon <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> presented us<br/>
                    with several kinds of seed Corn suitable for<br/> this Climet; divers kinds of
                    beans, and<br/> Garden seeds, such as Watermelons, Pump-<br/> -kins, Cucumbers
                    &amp;c with a quantity of<br/> Potatoes for to Plant, these he said had
                    been<br/> sent in from the different houses as a<br/> blessing to begin with, we
                    thought the<br/> hearty good will with which these were<br/> presented
                    manifested a full approba-<br/> -tion with our undertaking, there were<br/> more
                    of each sort, except potatoes than we <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_054" n="52"></pb> wanted to plant, and upon informing<br/>
                    him so we were answered, that we<br/> must take them all, for they were<br/>
                    sent in for that purpose. </p>

<p> We are now our own Cooks, dishwashers &amp;c<br/> Lining on our provisions that
                    we brought with us<br/> from <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> and
                        <a href="/places/frank">Franklin<placename key="frank"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
<del>ear-</del><br/>
<del>ly</del> informed us early after our arrival <del>how</del> that<br/> they
                    were scarce of Corn, occationed as he<br/> said by an uncommon overflow of the<br/>
<geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> last Spring, sometime after their<br/>
                    Corn was come up, and by an early Frost<br/> in the Fall. When enquiring for
                        <del>meat</del><br/> Bacon at <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>
                    to send up in the<br/> boat, we were informed that it was unne-<br/> -cessary to
                    carry <del>send</del> meat here, for there<br/> was a plenty in this place,
                    however<br/> we thought <del>but</del> not best to trust to an un-<br/>
                    -certainty, and have therefore 120 Lb<br/> of Bacon coming up in the Boat.
                    upon<br/> enquiry since we came here, we find <del>me</del><br/> meat is not to
                    be Obtained, about one<br/> pound of dryed meat, and four pounds<br/> fresh is
                    all we got of the Indians while<br/> amongst them, so that the prospect of
                    things <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_055" n="53"></pb> as to provision looked a little gloomy,
                        <del>ou</del><br/> our Boat <del>is</del> not being expected up in less
                    than<br/> 9 or 10 days from this date, but upon <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn- -planters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> informing, that he had several
                        <del>three</del><br/> Barrels of flour in his House, that<br/> he brought up
                    from <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, and<br/> when ever we got
                    out of meat, on lit-<br/> -ting him know, he would supply us; we<br/> felt
                    relieved. We agreed with Cornplan-<br/> -ters sister to supply us with three
                    Quarts<br/> of Milk a day at 8 Per Quart York Cur-<br/> -rency, but she presenly
                    let us know<br/> two quarts was as much as she could<br/> spare. We also got one
                    pound of but-<br/> -ter, such as it was, of her, at 2/. The Chief gave us<br/>
                    some Sugar, and some we purchased of<br/> the Indians at 1/6 Per Lb. we have a
                    pret-<br/> -ty Comfortable House much to ourselves, <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn- -planter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> has two Houses they stand about<br/> 10 feet
                    apart, tho Roofed over between as the <del>o</del><br/> other parts of the House
                    which is with<br/> Bark, this Space between the Houses serves<br/> for an entry,
                    and a place to pound their<br/> Corn <del>under</del> put their Wood &amp;c. out
                    of<br/> this entry a door opens into each <del>apart</del>
<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_056" n="54"></pb> apartment, that asigned us 30 feet<br/>
                    long, the other 24, and each 16 feet wide.<br/> they are built of Round Logs, or
                    Poles,<br/> let in close together, the net Chunked<br/> or plaistered, so that
                    we found our<br/> end pretty open and cold enough before<br/> morning, upon our
                    informing the Chief<br/> they had better make their Houses titeer,<br/>
                    plaistering up the Cracks, he replyed<br/> if they made their Houses too
                    warm,<br/> they would not like to leave them when<br/> Winter came to go a
                    hunting. along<br/> each side of these Houses, from the door<br/> to the
                    opposite end, ran Births, or<br/> Seats, they were about four feet wide<br/> and
                    one foot high, they were covered<br/> with Boards, and on these Deer-<br/> skins
                    were spread, and these were<br/> their Beds, they also make a pretty<br/> good
                    Seat, and are always ready,<br/> over these Births, about five feet<br/> high,
                    are Shelves of the same width<br/> of <del>those</del> the births
                        <del>beneath</del>, which serve to put <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_057" n="55"></pb> their Kitchen furniture, Corn &amp;c
                    upon,<br/> the fire is built on the ground in the<br/> Middle of the House, this
                    part between<br/> the births not being floored; there is a large<br/> hole left
                    in the Top of the Roof for<br/> the Smoke to go out at, which hole<br/> makes a
                    pretty good Window. -– As<br/> far as I have observed the above descrip-<br/>
                    -tion answers for most of their Houses, tho<br/> they are not so large, nor
                    double, like this, they<br/> are mostly from 12 to 15 feet Square,<br/> with a
                    shed before the door, there<br/> are perhaps 30 such houses in this <a href="/places/cornp">Village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a><br/> and a number more down the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname><br/> out of Sight, and some above, the<br/>
                    Houses are beautifully situated on<br/> the West side of the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>, which<br/> is about 150 Yards wide and
                    glides<br/> along by the <a href="/places/cornp">town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> with a gentle
                    current.<br/> the bank of the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> is low, tho
                    gra-<br/> -dually asscends to there Houses, which are<br/> mostly within 6 or 7
                    pearchs so that they<br/> readily supply themselves with Water <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_058" n="56"></pb> there being no springs on the flat
                    where<br/> the <a href="/places/cornp">Town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> stands, which flat is a
                    Sandy<br/> loam, easily tilled , and if well managed<br/> would be very
                    productive. there are 50<br/> or 60 Acres of Land adjoining the <a href="/places/cornp">Town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a><br/> nearly cleared, the most of
                        <del>this</del> which is put<br/> in Yearly with Corn, Beans, and
                    Potatoes.<br/> the Work is all done by the Women with<br/> Hoes, they were very
                    busy while we were<br/> here, much of the Land was grown up<br/> with Grass,
                    with Weeds &amp;c, they go round<br/> the Old Cornhills, which were very high,
                    as<br/> I have observed it is the general practice<br/> to have a hill when
                    finished near one foot<br/> high, and hoe the grass and weeds clean<br/> away,
                    then dig a hole where the hill stood<br/> and plant in the same place, and
                    sometime after<br/> the Corn comes up, the hoe all the face of<br/> the ground
                    over, so that it looked very<br/> neat. they plant beans with their Corn, also
                    a<br/> large quantity that they stick poles for,<br/> they also plant Squashes
                    and Pumpkins among<br/> their corn - The Women since we came here worked<br/>
                    hard, they found all their Corn, for homi-<br/> -ny, and for Bread, sift and
                    prepare it,<br/> Cut and Split all their Wood, and Carry<br/> it home on their
                    backs near a Quarter of <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_059" n="57"></pb> a Mile, make all there fires, and
                    all<br/> other Kitchen Business, plant and take<br/> care of their corn, and
                    gather it when ready,<br/> Plant their Beans and stick them, and<br/> as far as
                    I can learn all other out<br/> doors work, except building their houses<br/> and
                    Splitting the Rails that the Corn<br/> Land is enclosed with. It has been a<br/>
                    busy time since we came here, the Wo-<br/> -men have rose early, gone out
                    with<br/> their hoes to the Cornfield 4 or 5 in a<br/> Company, some of whom
                    where Old Gray<br/> Headed Women, and some young ones of<br/> 8, 10, or 12 Years
                    of age, stuck pretty<br/> Close to their Work, returned in the even-<br/> -ing
                    weary, and go early to Bed. one<br/> old Gray Headed Woman I have seen<br/>
                    steadily on the move, she has had both<br/> her feet so froze that she goes
                    altogether<br/> on her knees, I have seen her carrying<br/> in wood and making
                    the fire, going to the <geogname key="alleg">Ri-<br/> -ver</geogname> and
                    Bringing up water, I have seen<br/> take her hoe and go 40 pearches out to <br/>

                    the Men are<br/> spending their time in Idleness, such as<br/> shooting with
                    their bows and Arrows at a<br/> mark which is a very great recreation<br/>
<del>with them,</del> pitching of Queats, Jumping,<br/> playing at some kind of
                    Games, and on<br/> Musical Instruments, and loitering about<br/> so that I have
                    not while in this <a href="/places/cornp">Village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> seen<br/> either
                    Man or Boy at any kind of Work,<br/> to se little Girls, and Old Women

                    day a playing, looked<br/> unnatural, hard, and to me very grevi-<br/> -ous. The
                    Men at seasons go a hunting, and<br/> at times a Fishing, and they Work the
                    Canoe,<br/> at which they are very handy, there is very<br/> little game of any
                    kind at this season of<br/> the year brought in, I have seen but one<br/> deer
                    all the time we were among them<br/> and, I have seen no kind of any small<br/>
                    Game, except the Turkey heretofore noted.<br/> the Catch a few fish, yet but
                    little was<br/> done at it while we were there, <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_061" n="59"></pb> so that they live poor, their chief
                    subsistence<br/> at this season was Corn, beans, and Bears<br/> Oyl, in
                    different preparations, much of their<br/> Corn and Beans, were pounded into an
                    ho-<br/> -miny, and Boiled, this I thought was<br/> their Chief dependence, they
                    also pound<br/> Corn and Beans in to a flour, and make bread<br/> of it, they
                    also boyl it in dumplins, which<br/> they eat with Bear Oyl by dipping it
                    in,<br/> as they do also with their Bread, they<br/>
<del>also</del> sometimes put Oyl in there ho-<br/> -miny, <del>they</del> also
                    at times puts sugar in<br/> it, with which it eats very well, but<br/> from my
                    observation they eat much less <del>than</del><br/> than we do, a small piece of
                    Bread or dum-<br/> -plin dipped in the Oyl seemed to satisfy<br/> nature, and
                    there seated meals I thought<br/> were not more than two a day about<br/> 10 or
                    11 OClock, and in the Evening, if any<br/> of their friends came to see them,
                    the Visit was<br/> not interrupted with Cookery, or much<br/> Cerimony in laying
                    the table &amp;c. if their hominy<br/> was boiled, which was generally the case
                    af-<br/> -ter 11 OClock, the day through, and it was<br/> not material whether
                    Cold or Warm, and<br/> some of their acquaintance came in, the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_062" n="60"></pb> Births always made a seat ready,
                    wheren<br/> they were presently engaged in smoak-<br/> -ing and talking, and
                    while thus busily<br/> employed, a kettle of hominy with<br/> a large Wooden
                    spoon, is brought and<br/> set down on the Ground before them, he<br/> that is
                    most handy to it lays by his<br/> Pipe, and in a few minutes appears to be<br/>
                    satisfyed with his repast, and moves it on<br/> to the next, while the rest of
                    the Company<br/> are engaged as if no Victuals were<br/> near them, thus the
                    Kettle passes <del>th</del><br/> through the Company in a little time,<br/> and
                    when done with, hung up, until some<br/> -body else comes in, if they have
                    no<br/> hominy, the Bread, or dumplin, goes<br/> round in like manner; there is
                    no<br/> trouble of laying, or clearing the ta-<br/> -ble, or placing of Chairs,
                    Wiping the knives<br/> and Forks, or Changing of plates, but in<br/> a simple
                    and easy manner all that<br/> cerimony is avoided. </p>
<p> In their Cloathing and Dress their turn<br/> is for something tawdry; such as a
                    gay hand-<br/> -kerchief, Calico shirt, Scarlet Leggons,<br/> Blue Coat, or
                    petticoat, a belt of lively<br/>
<del>coo</del> colours <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_063" n="61"></pb> decorated with Beads tyed round their
                    mid-<br/> -dles, or knees, with long ends hanging<br/> down, the are very fond
                    of trinkets of<br/> various kinds in there noses, and Ears,<br/> the Men more
                    particularly. I have seen bobs<br/> of various kinds hanging there noses<br/> to
                    the weight of an Ounce, or more, coming<br/> down over their Mouth. the
                    Warriors<br/> have the rim of their Ears cut round,<br/> and loaded with
                    different kinds of<br/> Toys, until the hang down several<br/> Inches. I saw one
                    man with two padlocks<br/> in one Year, such as are used for Saddle-<br/> bags,
                    another with a Watch, such as<br/> Children use. large silver Crosses are<br/>
                    also made use of. their Calico shirts are<br/> short <del>and</del> &amp; have
                    ruffles to their sleeves<br/> &amp; Bosoms. the Men and Womens are both
                    made<br/> in the same form, they come a little lower<br/> than their Hips, and
                    hangs loose at the<br/> lower end, the Women wearing their<br/>
<del>Petticuts</del> Petticoats <del>over</del> under them, which<br/>
                    petticoats are mostly made of blue<br/> Cloath, without any needlework,
                    exept<br/> the stitching some red Worsted binding <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_064" n="62"></pb> on about 9 Inches of the upper part;
                    their<br/> way of making and putting them on is, to take<br/> a piece of Cloath
                    perhaps 1½ Yards long<br/> turn down the upper part as above described,
                    which<br/> part is spread over with Ribbons,<br/> then Wrap it tite round them,
                    and<br/> tye it with a string, their shift as<br/> mentioned, hanging the out
                    side, such<br/> who suckle lift up their Shirts for the Child<br/> to get at the
                    pap, which Conduct to those<br/> who are unacquainted with it may look<br/>
                    immodest, but it is not the case, for<br/> a Child is so suckled, and less of
                    the<br/> Mothers skin shown than is customa-<br/> -ry among our farmers Wives,
                    -</p>
<p> With all their tawdry and liveliness in<br/> dress the go dirty, I thought the
                    Women<br/> more particularly so than the Men, per-<br/> -haps from their working
                    harder, and<br/> being more among the grease, some of their shirts<br/> don’t
                    appear to be ever Washed, and<br/> about their Sholders the become very<br/>
                    black and greesy, from their greesy<br/> heads; their hair I have observed to
                    be<br/> the Cloath to wipe their greasy fingers <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_065" n="63"></pb> in, while eating their bread and
                    Oyl.<br/> thus for want of a change of Cloaths, and<br/> living in their dirt,
                    they become <del>very</del><br/> lowsy, which they try to extrecate them<br/>
                    -selves from, by pulling of their shifts,<br/> turning them inside
                        out<del>wards</del>, and<br/> hunting the Vermon with as much com-<br/>
                    -possure, and seemingly good grace,<br/> as a Mother amongst us would do, in
                    <br/> combing one of her Children, and this<br/> part of their dirt has not been
                    one of the<br/> least of our trials, neither have we any<br/> expectation of
                    leaving them, without<br/> carrying away some breeders. </p>
<p> For more than two weeks past the weather<br/> has been very dry, part of the
                    time a Cold<br/> north wind, we had frost for ten Mornings<br/> successively,
                    during which time we slept<br/> in open Cabins, in our blankets, so that<br/> we
                    sensible felt the want of more cover-<br/> -ing, and a better Bed before
                    morning.<br/> for two or three days past the weather has<br/> been warm, with a
                    strong South wind.<br/> the Woods has been much on fire dur-<br/> -ing this dry
                    weather, Clouds of smoke <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_066" n="64"></pb> have frequently covered us, so that
                    the<br/> Sun has been hid. A curious Sight present-<br/> -ed two nights ago, of
                    some neighbouring<br/> Hills or rather mountains that were on fire,<br/> perhaps
                    the had not been burnt for seve-<br/> -ral Years, and the great quantity of
                    dead<br/> timber, both standing and laying down,<br/> having taken fire as it
                    passed along,<br/>
<del>which</del> made a very lively appearance in<br/> the night, looking as if
                    the whole Mountain<br/> was on fire. – We have been under<br/> some exercise for
                    a few days past concern-<br/> -ing our goods, which are coming up<br/> the
                        <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>, <del>we</del> hav<del>e</del> ing
                    very little cause to<br/> expect their arrival before the last of<br/> this
                    Month, and the dry weather has<br/> been such for some time past, that the<br/>
<geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> has fallen very fast, which the<br/>
                    Indians remarked to us with some degree<br/> of seriousness, saying that it
                    would be<br/> with difficulty the Boat could be ~<br/> brought up some Shallow
                    places, but in<br/> the midst of our trials we have still<br/> been favoured; a
                    considerable quantity of<br/> rain fell last Evening, tho no diffi-<br/> -rence
                    yet appears in the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname>, there <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_067" n="65"></pb> is some reason to hope it will rise.</p>
<p> We intended to have set of this Morning<br/> by Eight OClock for <a href="/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, <del>and</del><br/> and agreed with
                        <a href="/people/habee1">Henry Obeal<persname key="habee1"></persname></a> last<br/> evening to go with
                    us, and be our en-<br/> -terpretter; it is now eleven OClock, yet nei-<br/>
                    -ther he, nor his Fathers family have got<br/> their breakfast, tho we have been

                    back, the other three<br/> having started an hour sooner with<br/> one Indian in
                    a Canoe; we rode the<br/>
<geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> one mile above the <a href="/places/cornp">Town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>, and<br/> went up the Eastside of it, <del>to said
                            <a href="/places/cornp">Town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a></del><br/> our first 3 or 4
                    miles was through an Open bot-<br/> -tom, thinly timbered, and good riding,
                    then<br/> passed through thick Timber, a large quan-<br/> -tity of which were
                    Sugar Maple, thence<br/> through a thick Forrest of Hemlock, and<br/> pine, very
                    difficult to pass, to the shore<br/> opposite the place of destination; here
                    we<br/> again rode the <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname> tho wide and<br/>
                    deep, we stoped at the House of a Chief who<br/> went with us to our inten ded
                    Settlement,<br/> here we met with our friends who went <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_068" n="66"></pb> in the Canoe. We viewed an Empty
                    house<br/> that <del>on</del> stood near our Settlement, <del>we</del><br/> but
                    not liking it, we proceeded to ano-<br/> -ther that was on <del>it</del> said
                    settlement wherein a family<br/> lived, we understood they proposed<br/> leaving
                    it, and would sell their right,<br/> upon conferring with the Woman, who<br/> we
                    understood was the owner of the<br/> house, she was willing to part with
                    the<br/> house but having put in a few spots<br/> with Corn and Vines, the whole
                    not more<br/> than 3 or 4 pearch Square, she <del>was</del> appeared<br/>
                    unwilling to relinquish them, and they<br/> were so in our way, that we thought
                    we<br/> had better look elsewhere for a settlement,<br/> but upon the Chiefs
                    conferring with her,<br/> she was willing to part with each of the<br/> spots
                    except one which was not much in<br/> our way, and we understanding she<br/> was
                    a sober Woman that would be likely<br/> to make good use of the Money, we paid
                    her 20<br/> dollars for her house and previligdges,<br/> and with our assistance
                    she removed out<br/> and in less than an hour we had possission <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_069" n="67"></pb> our young men gave <del>it</del> the
                    house a thorough cleaning,<br/> and before dark our scanty furniture was<br/>
                    arranged for House-keeping, and having<br/> supped on our preparations, which
                    admitted<br/> of but little change, we prepared for bed in<br/> our open house,
                    and naked Walls, the Indi-<br/> -an Chief at our request sent us three<br/>
                    deerskins with the hair on, which <del>which</del><br/> we placed for our
                    Conveniency, and re-<br/> -tired, but we sensibly felt before morn-<br/> -ing
                    the want of a better bed and more Clothes.<br/> the night being cold we were
                    under the<br/> necessity of rising several times to re-<br/> -new our fire. Our
                    house is about 20<br/> feet long, 14 feet wide, and 6 feet high to the<br/>
                    Square, Covered with bark, and a shed over<br/> the door, and finished within as
                    is usual<br/> in Indian buildings, it stands on an ele-<br/> -vated spot within

                    side, the soil about<br/>
<del>it</del> said house is of a light sandy quality, easy to be<br/> tilled;

<p> I neglected noting in its<br/> proper place, that fifth day last about 11<br/>
                    OClock we retired into our humble Cabin,<br/> and were favoured to witness the
                    over-<br/> -shadowing Wing of Consoling goodness,<br/> to the Comforting and
                    contriting of our<br/> Spirits, and this day we had a like Op-<br/> -pertunity,
                    and were I thought alike<br/> favoured, may such seasons be remembred<br/> with
                    gratitude, and with thankfulness and may<br/> our young friends be encouraged
                    &amp;<br/> strengthened to keep up such religious<br/> oppertunities when we are
                    far separated, which I<br/> trust they will. this is the fifth day since<br/> we
                    came to this <a href="/places/genes1">Town<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, we brought but<br/>
                    little provision with us here, having<br/> but little to bring, and had a hope
                    we<br/> should have been able to have got<br/> some dryed Venison of the Indians
                    here, which has<br/> not been the case, we got a little Bears Oyl<br/> of them,
                    but that article is scarce, and<br/> dear, this day intending to have made <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_074" n="72"></pb> a dinner of some flitters, our Bread<br/>
                    being nearly out, and our flour so re-<br/> -duced as to discourage attempting
                    to<br/> bake; while we were frying our<br/> flitters, an Indian man came in<br/>
<del>in</del> and presented us with about four Pounds of fresh Ve-<br/> -nison
                    without any bone in it; part of<br/> which we immediately fryed, which<br/> with
                    our flitters made us the most a-<br/> -greeable dinner we have met with<br/> in
                    the Indian Country, we sat down<br/> to it with thankful hearts for so
                    unex-<br/> -pected a supply. we gave the Indian<br/> a Quarter of a dollar, for
                    his Venison,<br/> which he recieved with an apparant<br/> reluctance, but as he
                    could not speak <del>no</del><br/> English, we were altogether at a loss<br/> to
                    know, whether it proceeded from<br/> what we gave him being too much, or<br/>
                    too little, but the same afternoon he took<br/> three of us down in a Canoe to
                        <a href="/places/cornp">Corn- -planters Village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> to attend a
                    general<br/> Council that was to be held there<br/> tomorrow, he took the Money
                    with him<br/> and gave it to <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, and
                    said<br/> something to him in Indian, which <del>being</del><br/> was, that the
                    Venison he brought us was <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_075" n="73"></pb> a gift, and he wished not to recieve
                    any<br/> money for it, and the money was handed back<br/> to us, which we
                    immeadiately presented to<br/> him for <del>his</del> the <del>his</del> trouble
                    of bringing<br/> us down in his Canoe, which he reciev-<br/> -ed with

<p> Two of our number whom we left at <a href="/places/genes1">Genesin-

                    them<br/> in Council, there being between 30 and 40, six<br/> of whom were there
                    most respectable Women, early<br/> in the Oppertunity <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> made a pretty<br/> length speech, <del>which</del>
                    it did not appear to be di-<br/> -rected to us, which our interpretter

                    with Murdering a White<br/> Man, for which he had been in Jail at<br/>
<a href="/places/pitts">Pitts-burgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, and tryed for his Life, but

                    evidence<br/> to support the charge, yet there was cause to fear<br/> it was too
                    true, and the Chiefs speech appear-<br/> -ed to be delivered with much earnest,
                    and<br/> serious expostulation. <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
                    then <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_076" n="74"></pb> directed his speech to us, expressing his

                            to live on; but we hope against another year<br/> they will have a

                            it; you must find half the Mo-<br/> -ney to build this Mill, and we will
                            find the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_078" n="76"></pb> other half; and we hope Brothers,
                            you will<br/> save some money you get from the White<br/> People between
                            now and that time; that<br/> so you may have your share ready
                            against<br/> next spring; and we think you had bet-<br/> -ter choose one

<p> We then were favoured seriouly to<br/> expostulate with them on various
                    subjects<br/> retative to their Moral, and Civil Con-<br/> -duct, particularly
                    there excessive use<br/> of Strong drink, divers instances of<br/> which we had
                    been Eye witnesses of,<br/> since among them, several of their Wo-<br/> -men

                    and heard us<br/> with attention, but as far as I have ob-<br/> -served since
                    among them, little or no<br/> Shame covers an Indian for getting<br/> drunk. --
                    They informed us they<br/> would withdraw a little while into ano-<br/> -ther
                    Room, and confer on our propos-<br/> -als, which doing, in about an hour<br/>
                    they returned, and made us an answer<br/> in substance as follows,</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_081" n="79"></pb>
<p> Brothers, we now hear all what you would<br/> wish to do among us; you
                            are come here<br/> to see us Brothers; you wish us well; you<br/> wish
                            us to become as the White People;<br/> the White People are rich and got
                            every<br/> thing, the Indians are Poor, and <del>got</del> have<br/>
                            nothing.</p>
<p> Brothers, you told us one thing; it be<br/> good for us to build a Mill;
                            we must<br/> find 400 dollars, and you will find<br/> 400 dollars.</p>
<p> Brothers, we cant say but few Words<br/> at this time about this Mill;
                            we<br/> will consult <a href="/people/ichap1">Captain Chapin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a>,
                            if he<br/> thinks we will recieve our money;<br/> and will be able to
                            raise the money you<br/> propose, then we will do it</p>
<p> Brothers, we know how far you have come<br/> to see us, it is a great
                            way; from the<br/> Seashore where our forefathers once liv-<br/> -ed:
                            the White People have cheated us,<br/> and got our land from us, and now <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_082" n="80"></pb> we have but little left, we will
                            try to<br/> learn your way.</p>
<p> Brothers, you know there are some<br/> bad People amongst us, and you
                            know<br/> we have been cheated, and that makes<br/> us bad, and our
                            Minds uneasy; if we<br/> had not been cheated we should have<br/> been
                            very rich People, and had plen-<br/> -ty of every thing, and then our
                            Minds<br/> would be easy, and we could think on<br/> the good
                            Spirit.</p>
<p> Brothers, the reason I mention to you a-<br/> -bout our being Cheated,
                            some of my War-<br/> -riors wont mind what I say unto them;<br/> but
                            will have their own way, because<br/> they know I often have been
                            Cheated<br/> by the White People; If I had never been<br/> cheated, then
                            my Warriors would believe<br/> me, and mind what I say to them, but<br/>
                            now they wont mind.</p>
<p> Brothers, we cant all go to work at once<br/> some of my Warriors will
                            go a hunting<br/> to get Provisions, and sometimes they broke <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_083" n="81"></pb> a Gun, and then it takes a great
                            deal of<br/> money to get a new one, we have very<br/> few Hoes, and
                            Axes, and such things amon-<br/> -gst us, and we are not able to get
                            them.</p>
<p> Brothers, I will go along with you to <a href="/places/canan">Canan
                                darque<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, and there we will get matters settled<br/> about
                            the Mill, and bring it back to your<br/> young men in Writing.</p>
<p> Brothers, this is all I have <del>now</del> got to say<br/> we will now
                            Shake hands.</p>

<p> At the close of this speech we expressed a few words<br/> more, representing
                    among other things the un-<br/> -reasonableness of their present practice,
                    of<br/> their Mothers, Wives, and Sisters, working<br/> all day in the fields,
                    and in the Woods, with<br/> their hoes, and axes, whilst they themselves<br/>
                    were at the same time playing with their<br/> Bows and Arrows &amp;c
                    recommending to them<br/> to begin our way by early setting their boys<br/> to
                    business, taking them out to how Corn &amp;c<br/> thus by early habitting them
                    to Work, their<br/> Minds will be turned to it, business will<br/> become
                    familier, and they will not think<br/> hard of it. and as they expressed the
                    White<br/> People were rich and had plenty, we let them <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_084" n="82"></pb> know it was by industry it Was
                    obtained<br/> the men doing their share of business<br/> in the fields, &amp;c
                    thereby leaving the Wo-<br/> -men more time to attend to spinning,<br/> sewing,
                    darying &amp;c in the house.</p>
<p> We concluded with seriously impressing<br/> on their Minds the remembrance,
                    that<br/> it was from the good Spirit they re-<br/> -cieved every good thing,
                    and that he<br/> could hear every good Word they said,<br/> and see every thing
                    they did, and if they<br/> were good, and industerous, this good<br/> Spirit
                    would love them, and bless them<br/> with many good things. In a few
                    minutes<br/> after we had concluded, and informed them<br/> we had done,
                        <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> Observed, now<br/> all things
                    were done, and settled, we<br/> will cover up the Council fire.</p>
<p> We had no provision of our own here,<br/> therefore concluded to stay and dine
                    with<br/> the Chief, about five Oclock we had a<br/> loaf of Warm Indian Bread
                    with a mix-<br/> -ture of Beans that had been boiled till<br/> they were softish
                        <del>nea</del> kneaded up in it<br/>
<del>the Bread and baked</del>
<del>that was</del>
<del>set before us,</del> the<br/> bread <del>had been</del>
<del>was</del> baked in a Dutch Oven <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_085" n="83"></pb> having a small quantity of Bears Oyl
                    put<br/> into the oven with it, and when part<br/> baked the loaf was turned
                    over with a<br/> fresh supply of Oyl, <del>we t</del> this was all we<br/> had
                    set before us; they informed us they had no<br/> meat, and we had heretofo shewn
                    our dislike<br/> to bread diped in Oyl; however with a<br/> good Appatite it
                    went down very well, but<br/> before we had fully done a little butter was<br/>
                    set before us <del>on the Table</del> that they had obtained some<br/> -where in
                    the Village. -- We now got half<br/> a £ of flour of <a href="/people/cornp">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp"></persname></a> for which he<br/> made no charge, and four Quarts of
                    bears<br/> Oyl of his wife, which she claiming as her<br/> property charged us
                    half a dollar a Quart,<br/> these our Young men took up this evening with
                    them<br/> to <a href="/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, together with
                    what<br/> Chocolate we had, <del>this evening</del>; leaving<br/>

<p> In the council yesterday we informed the<br/> Indians that <a href="/people/jpier1">John Pierce<persname key="jpier1"></persname></a> and myself expected<br/>
<del>in a few days</del> to be at liberty in a few days<br/> to leave them, and
                    return to our families<br/> and Friends; and since the concluding <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_086" n="84"></pb> of the Council we see nothing but
                    what<br/> we might set of in a day or two if our<br/> goods were
                        <del>arrived</del> come; we have not<br/> heard any <del>from</del> of them
                    since we left<br/>
<a href="/places/pitts">Pitts-Burgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, but hope they will shortly<br/>

                    there delivery <del>coming</del><br/>
<del>here</del>, -- Our situation is diffirent from<br/> what it was when we
                    were here al-<br/> -together, we then had a room much<br/> to ourselves, and
                    cooked our own<br/> Victuals, we now board with <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn- -planter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, who uses us kind, and as<br/> well as his
                    house will afford, We have<br/> &gt;had Tea made of the Root of Sassifras,
                    also<br/> of an herb like fern, and thin cakes<br/> of wheat Bread baked, or
                    rather fryed<br/> in a pan they eat very well, so that<br/> we have no cause to
                    complain of our<br/> living if it was not for their dirt, <del>and</del><br/>
<del>their lice</del> &amp;c which try’s us. --- <del>we enquir-</del><br/>
<del>-ed</del> Our road from <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> here,
                    was<br/> pretty much of a Northeast coarse, and <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_087" n="85"></pb> part of it very rough and tedious, so
                    that<br/> we have been desirous of finding a <del><gap></gap></del><br/> nearer, and
                    better way home, we early en-<br/> -quired of <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> if there was any path<br/> from this <a href="/places/cornp">Town<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> across the Mountains to<br/> the big Island on

                        <del>but it</del> which was but little<br/> used, and through a rough
                    uninhabited<br/> Country, we should have to lay out at nights,<br/> carry
                    provision for ourselves, and some for<br/> our horses, and that it would take us
                    five<br/> days <del>to travel it</del> and it was so Moun-<br/> -tainous and
                    rough, that it would be with<br/> the greatest difficulty we could get our
                    hor-<br/> -ses along, we then enquired for a way to<br/>
<a href="/places/canan">Canandarque<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, and how far, he told us it
                    was<br/> 160 miles, and not a very difficult road,<br/> that he and his Son
                        <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a> were going<br/> there in a few days,
                    and he would be<br/> glad of our Company; we had felt some<br/> little draft in
                    our Minds to go home by <a href="/places/checkPlace">O--neida<placename key="checkPlace"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/canan">Canandarque<placename key="canan"></placename></a> being in the way which made the Chiefs proposal

                    desiring his attendance<br/> there as soon as he conveniently could<br/> for the

<a href="/people/rmorr1">Robert Morris<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a> and Company were coming<br/> to
                    run out the land the Indians sold them<br/> last fall, and also to run and
                    settle the<br/> lines of the Indians reservations, they<br/> Chief expressed a
                    great desire <a href="/people/jpier1">John Peirce<persname key="jpier1"></persname></a><br/> and myself
                    should go with him to the<br/> Council and attend there while the business<br/>
                    was transacting, which upon weighing, we<br/> let him know we felt a freedom
                    comply to <del>go</del><br/> with <del>him</del>. -- While we were writing<br/>
                    this afternoon we heard an uncommon<br/> noise, which caused us to look out
                    to<br/> see from what it proceeded, where we<br/> saw a Man in a frightful
                    Dress, we<br/> then walked out more fully to view<br/> the sight, where we saw
                    two Men<br/> with naked Arms, Thighs, and legs,<br/> they had Bearskins on their
                    backs <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_089" n="87"></pb> which hung down below their hips,
                    and<br/> tyed <del>together</del> across their breasts, and on<br/> their head
                    they had a grim and Terrible<br/> appearance, this false face, for so it
                    was<br/> called, was made as frightfull as nature<br/> could invent, the hair on
                    its head hang-<br/> -ing forward and over the face; the Mouth <del>gr</del><br/>
                    grinning, large, and much aside; the<br/> nose, and Cheeks Wrinkled and
                    very<br/> Huge; the Eyes set around with tin to re-<br/> -semble the uncommon
                    stearing, and the<br/> whole face painted red and black, each<br/> of these Men
                    had in their hands a stick<br/> of about 8 Inches in length fastened<br/> to a
                    <gap></gap> shell of a Water Tortise, the <del>which</del><br/> Shells had some small
                    stones or other<br/> hand substances in them, which made<br/> a great rattleing:
                    which noise was much<br/> much increased by their reubbing<br/> them against the
                    Logs of a certain<br/> house where they appeared to be sta-<br/> -tioned as
                    guards the whole conduct of these<br/> Men were <del>appeared to be</del> truly

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_090" n="88"></pb>
<del>where the men appeared to be plac-</del><br/>
<del>-ed as guards</del>, many of whom were young<br/> Men, who endeavored to
                    peep through<br/> the Craks of the Logs into the House, and<br/> these guards
                    used <del>their</del> great exertion<br/> to keep them off, or to catch them, it
                    look-<br/> -ed dreadful to fall into their hands, which<br/> made the Young men
                    use great endeavours<br/> to avoid it, I asked our <del>Young</del> interpretter
                    what<br/> would be the Consequence if any of them<br/> should be taken, he said
                    they would put Ashes<br/> on their Heads, and very much dgrade<br/> them, we saw
                    a number of elderly Women go-<br/> -ing into the house, whom these monsters

                    but said they had met there for a frolic, and<br/> to drink Whiskey, but as far

<p> About Sunrise this Morning our<br/> guide, <a href="/people/ijohn1">Indian
                        John<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a> a Chief that lives in<br/> this <a href="/places/genes1">Town<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> called on us, and being ready<br/> to take our departure;
                    about 5 OClock<br/> we took an affectionate farewell of<br/> our Young Friends
                    and set of for the<br/> mouth of <geogname key="buffr">Buffaloe</geogname>, we
                    went up the <geogname key="alleg">Ri-<br/> -ver</geogname> about five miles,
                    through a very<br/> thick Wood, and a great quantity of<br/> Windfel timber,
                    there was a large pro-<br/> -portion of young stuff growing up, and<br/> next to
                    no path; we frequently got very<br/> wet from the bushes, we then left the
                        <geogname key="alleg">River</geogname><br/> to our right and went up a fine
                    Country<br/> heavily timbered, mostly white pine, having <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_105" n="103"></pb> a small Creek at some distance on out
                    right<br/> and <del>for</del>
<del>3</del>
<del><unclear>for</unclear></del> in 3 or 4 miles we passed through an<br/> Old
                    Indian field, thence up <del>and</del> the aforsaid<br/> water through some very
                    good <del>Champion</del> land with a<br/>
<del>very</del> luxuriant growth of grass, and Weeds<br/> of various kinds,
                        <del>some swamps</del> and very<br/> thick wood about 4 miles, thence
                    entred<br/> a rough hilly country, heavy timbred, mostly hemlock and I thought
                    thin land for 7 or 8 miles a<br/> large quantity of which was down, so that<br/>
                    what with the hills, the logs, the Brush &amp;<br/>
<del>the</del> swampy gutts it required patience and a good<br/> Stock of
                    Spirits; I mentioned to my Companion<br/> sometime after we set of this
                        <del>this</del> morning<br/> that my Mind, was uncommonly easy, cheer-<br/>
                    -ful, and sweet, so that I passed along, in a<br/> lively and well qualifyed
                    state to make tra-<br/> veling pleasant, but before Evening I foun[d]<br/> my
                    stock of spirits was much exhausted. About<br/> 11 O Clock we had a very heavy
                    Rain, such an<br/> one as but seldom happens, it lasted perhaps<br/> an hour, so
                    that we got very wet, when it<br/> abated we stopped and barked some trees<br/>
                    to have a trough to feed our horses out<br/> of, and taking some refreshment
                    ourselves<br/> we mounted, having for several miles past<br/> been riding over
                    fine <del>Champion</del> land, a little<br/> hilly and <del>heavily</del> loaded
                    with <del>and</del> timber<del>ed</del>, we had some fears about <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_106" n="104"></pb> about getting over <geogname key="catar">Catarawgus</geogname> this morn-<br/> -ing before we started, and this
                    heavy<br/> rain increased them; however we mov-<br/> -ed on over a fine country,
                    tho a trying road<br/> the Limbs, the Brush and the Logs were<br/> ever in our
                    way, much of the Timber in<br/> this days ride has been Hemlock, some<br/>
                    Chesnut, Sugar maple, Beech, Oak &amp;c but<br/> as we advanced towards
                        <geogname key="catar">Catarawgus</geogname>, we<br/> had a large proportion
                    of very fine<br/> poplars; when we got near to the <geogname key="catar">river</geogname><br/> we passed through a very <del>luxuriant</del>
                    rich<br/> bottom, with an uncommon luxuriant growth of vegetation and about
                    sunset arrived at<br/> the stream, which we found to be many<br/> pearches out
                    of its banks at the Common<br/> fording place, and our guide signed to us<br/>
                    that it would run over our horses backs<br/> and sweep them away; we therefore
                        <del>being</del> con<br/> -cluded to pitch Camp, <del>we were
                            <unclear>got</unclear></del> being in-<br/> to an Open bottom where
                    there was pretty<br/> well of grass, so that our horses would<br/> have done
                    very well if it had not been<br/> for the gnats and muschetoes; we struck<br/>
                    up a fire, and under some Bushes, we had<br/> put up to keep of the due, got a
                    pretty <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_107" n="105"></pb> Comfortable nights rest,
                        <del>having</del> in the<br/> evening we viewed the <geogname key="catar">river</geogname> above the fording<br/> place, and <del>we</del> found
                        <del>that</del> there <del>was</del> were some marks<br/> of its having
                    fallen an Inch or more. 35 m<br/> we saw neither house nor cabin in this days

<p> Rose early this Morning, and upon<br/> viewing <geogname key="catar">Cateragus</geogname> we found it had fell<br/> several Inches, we therefore
                    fed our horses<br/>
<del>got our breakfast,</del> and prepared for mov-<br/> -ing, we had lodged on
                    an Island, which our<br/>
<a href="/people/ijohn1">guide<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a> took us round to the head of that
                    so<br/> we might have the advantage of the Cur-<br/> -rent in Crossing it. we
                    found the bed of the<br/>
<geogname key="catar">Creek</geogname> was wide, and there was a large gra-<br/>
                    -velly Island several pearches from <del>for</del> our Shor[e]<br/>
<del><gap></gap></del>, we decended the Bank and rode<br/> to it, the Water not being
                    more than knee<br/> deep, we then <del>rode</del> went down this Island 20 or
                    more<br/> Pearches to where our guide <del>singn</del> signed<br/> for us to
                    Cross, the Water ran very swift,<br/> but did not appear to be as deep as he
                    gave<br/> us to expect, which was to come within Six<br/> Inches of the top of
                    our horses backs, we<br/>
<del>mentioned</del> signed to our <a href="/people/ijohn1">guide<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a> to
                    lead the way, he<br/> being well mounted on <a href="/people/hsimm1">Henry

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_108" n="106"></pb> showed evident marks of fear; and the
                    task being likely<br/> to fall on me, I pulled of my great Coat &amp;<br/> tyed
                    it up well behind me, and raised<br/> my saddlebags by putting some luggage<br/>
                    under them, and having previously<br/> cut a pole to carry in my hand to
                    mea-<br/> -sure the depth of the stream &amp;c, I entered<br/>
<del>it</del> the <geogname key="catar">river</geogname> without much fear, tho
                    not without care:<br/> and found our guide was mistaken in<br/> its depth, and
                    well for us he was, for<br/> had it been as deep as he expected,<br/> no horse
                    could have stood before <del>it</del> the stream, I<br/> got safely through, my

                    landed <del>with safety</del> the follow<br/> -ed, and arrived also safe with
                    gladened<br/> hearts; we then pursued our Journey<br/> with chearfulness down
                    the rich bottoms<br/> of said <geogname key="catar">stream</geogname>, a great
                    number of <del>Poplers</del><br/> large beautiful Poplars, White Oaks,
                    Pines,<br/> and Blackwalnuts made there appearance<br/> also some fine natural
                    Meadows of good grass,<br/> and in 10 miles we arrived at a Village<br/> of
                        <a href="/places/munseeind">Munsy<placename key="munseeind"></placename></a> Indians in a Champion Country
                    being the first dwellings we had seen since we left for the <geogname key="alleg">Allegeny</geogname> hav-<br/> -ing rode through an open Wood for
                    4 or <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_109" n="107"></pb> 5 miles past grown up with herbage
                    of<br/> different kinds very thick, and near thre[e]<br/> feet high, we stopped
                    at a house in this Village<br/>
<del>got our</del> &amp; Breakfasted on our own provision. The<br/> Town and
                    pasture land was enclosed in<br/> a lot of perhaps 12 or more acres which
                    look<br/> -ed Clean and pretty, having very good pasture<br/> in the enclosure,
                    where were several horses, Cows <del>and</del><br/> and swine. their houses
                    looked pretty snug,<br/> perhaps 18 or 20 in number; their Corn land<br/> was
                    down towards the <geogname key="catar">River</geogname>, the plant it<br/>
                    without any inclosure, keeping their stock<br/> in the lot. The house we went
                    into had<br/> a large quantity of Corn hanging up in it,<br/> considerably more
                    than I saw all the time<br/> I was at <geogname key="alleg">allegeny</geogname>,
                    and upon enquiring, we<br/> understood they sell many bushels every<br/> year to
                    the White People, their Vicinity to<br/>
<geogname key="lakee">lake Erie</geogname>, makes it easy conveying it down<br/>
                    the River there, and then it goes by Water to<br/> new settled Countries, we
                    were informed it<br/> was as low as 4 or 5 shillings per Bushel,<br/> which is
                        <del>low</del> cheap for a new Country, we found<br/> in <a href="/places/canad">Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a> and other placed Corn Rated at<br/> a dollar
                    per Bushel -- Most of the principal<br/> Men in the Village and others gathered <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_110" n="108"></pb> into the house where we were, and<br/>
                    their being a Whiteman living a-<br/> -mongst them that could interpret, we<br/>
                    informed them of what we had been<br/> doing at <a href="/places/cornp">Cornplanters settlement<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>, and<br/> of the young Men we had left
                    there to<br/> Instruct the Indians to Plough &amp;c, and<br/> of friends concern
                    for the Indians in<br/> general; with which they expressed their<br/>
                    satisfaction, saying they took it very<br/> kind that we called to see them, and
                    to<br/> inform them of what we had been doing<br/> &gt;at <a href="/places/cornp">Jeniscatago<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>, for they had heard something<br/> about it, but
                    they had nothing further to<br/> say, we then shook hands with them
                        <del>all</del><br/>
<del>round</del> and bid them farewell, <del>We then</del> and<br/> turned a
                    little to the right, leaving <geogname key="catar">Cate-<br/> -ragus</geogname>
                    considerable to our left, and in<br/> about 7 miles of a very swampy
                    teadious<br/> road, through good land abounding with<br/> Poplars, and with
                    other timber heavily loaded,<br/> we arrived at <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname>. here we gratifyed<br/> our eyes <del>in</del> a while in
                    viewing this Ob-<br/> -sequious Element as far as the Convex<br/> state of the
                    globe would admit, -- <del>here</del> we now <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_111" n="109"></pb> turned still more to the right, and
                    went<br/> along the beach to <del>lake to</del> the mouth of <geogname key="buffr">Buf-<br/> -folae</geogname> 29 miles, the prospect the
                        <del>remainder</del><br/> remaining part of this day was pleasant, and it
                    was<br/> rather heightened by our being so long confined<br/> in the Woods. The
                    road was in places<br/> good, but in other places very heavy,<br/>
<del>that</del>
<del>being a large</del> the gravel being near fetlock deep.<br/> We had the
                        <geogname key="lakee">Lake</geogname> on our left, the surf roling<br/>
                    gently to the shore in waves two or three<br/> feet high. On our Right was a
                    Majestick ap-<br/> -pearance of rocks and stones piled up<br/> in verey uniform
                    order, in places from<br/> 20 to 60 feet high, as upright as the Wall<br/> of a
                    house, and in other places projecting<br/> over several feet, the bottom of
                    these<br/> Rocks <del>are</del>
<del>wore</del> with the bearing of the<br/> Waves, and Sand, and Gravel,
                        <del>until</del><br/>
<del>they are</del> were wore into Curious shapes, and<br/> as smooth as
                    polished Marble, from<br/> the tops of these Rocks the water was
                    <del>tr</del><br/> trickling down very entertaining, I ob-<br/> -served some
                    Rocks standing in the edge<br/> of the Water, as large over, and round<br/> as a
                    Millstone, the upper part whereof <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_112" n="110"></pb> was wore nearly to the shape of the
                    largest<br/> end of an Egg, &amp; as round as if turned<br/> in a leathe. In a
                    number of places<br/> the water came up to the Wall of Rocks,<br/> so that we
                    had to ride 40 or more pearch-<br/> -es in the <del>Water</del> Lake in places
                    Belly deep,<br/> and the Water was very dirty at the<br/> Shore with its beating
                    the sand &amp;c so<br/> that we could not see the bottom, and<br/> did not know
                    but the next step the<br/> horses made might take them over<br/> their Backs,
                    but what made it look<br/> the most romantic was the continu-<br/> -al beating
                    of the Waves, which came<br/> up against these Rocks, and the Wa-<br/> -ter
                    would at times fly over our heads<br/> and sufficeintly wet the traveller.
                    The<br/> last 10 miles we very much left the Rocks,<br/> and as we advanced the
                    bank grew lower,<br/> so that very high Westerly Winds raises<br/> the
                        <del>Lake</del> water and Waves on this side the<br/>
<geogname key="lakee">Lake</geogname> until it overflows the Bank and<br/>
                    drowns a considerable Country, which is very<br/> level, and Wet for Common. It
                    was very<br/> evident for a number of Miles here away <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_113" n="111"></pb> that the <geogname key="lakee">Lake</geogname> is gradually moving towards<br/> the Southeast as most of
                    the trees which<br/> stand along its margin has the dirt washed<br/> away from
                    their roots for 3, 4, or more feet<br/> deep, <del>and</del> so that they are
                    dead &amp; falling fast; and<br/> I thought it was as visible when on the<br/>
<a href="/places/canad">Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a> shore opposite, that the Land was<br/>
                    gaining there. ---- We got to the Mouth<br/> of <geogname key="buffr">Buffaloe</geogname> before sunset, where we put our<br/> saddles and
                    Baggage into a boat <del>wich</del> which took<br/> us over, and we swam our
                    horses through the<br/>
<geogname key="buffr">River</geogname> it being perhaps near 100 yards wide
                    and<br/> 10 or more feet deep, here we met with a compa-<br/> -ny of men who
                    were going to run out <a href="/people/rmorr1">Robert Morrises<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a>

                    up for us, we acknowledged his<br/> kindness, and accepted his offer, after<br/>
                    feeding our horses we turned them out to<br/> bare <unclear>picking</unclear> in

                    on<br/> Bread, Fish, and Chocolate; we got a pretty<br/> good nights rest, which
                    we wanted being weary<br/> having traveled 45 miles, no white inhabitant for the

                    the horses a little unruly so that we felt<br/> thankful when we got safely on

<p> Set of early this morning to see friends down<br/> the Mountain, as it is
                    called, in 7 miles<br/> we came on the <geogname key="niagr">Niagara
                        River</geogname>, thence down<br/> the <geogname key="niagr">River</geogname> close on its Margin 18 miles to the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_116" n="114"></pb>
<geogname key="niagf">great falls</geogname>, having about two miles back
                    fer-<br/> -ried the <geogname key="chipp">Chippaway River</geogname>, the bridge
                    being<br/> broke, <del>it</del> said <geogname key="chipp">River</geogname> is
                    perhaps 100 yards Wide 10 or 12<br/> feet deep with no perceptable Current.<br/>
                    at the <geogname key="niagf">falls</geogname> I once more gratified my Eyes<br/>
                    in beholding this Wonderfull Phinomina<br/> in nature, the appearance was
                    truly<br/> Solemn, and speaks a loud Language.<br/> but as I have given a pretty
                    circumstantial<br/> account thereof in my notes when here last<br/> fall, I
                    think it not necessary to add, further<br/> than we now went down a very steep
                    bank<br/> of 100 or more feet <del>in hight</del> to the Table Rock<br/> , as it
                    is called, which lies Horrizontal and<br/> runs across the <geogname key="niagr">River</geogname>, which bank we<br/> we <del>then</del> thought not safe to
                    descend when here before <del>last fall</del><br/> by reason of the sleet, or
                    Ice that covered<br/> the Hill, which sleet had collected from the<br/> mist
                    that ascended from the Voilent age-<br/> -tation of the Water. It was now
                    about<br/> noon and a clear warm day, the fog that<br/> ascended was abundantly
                    less, than the<br/> Cold morning I was here before, yet be-<br/> -fore we got to
                    the bottom of the bank<br/> the bushes &amp;c. became very wet, and I <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_117" n="115"></pb> believe had we stayed on the Rock at
                    the<br/> grand pitch one hour our Cloathes would<br/> have been nearly wet
                    through; we had now<br/> a very fair prospect of the Water Shoot-<br/> -ing over
                    the Rock, and its <del>desen</del> descend-<br/> -ing with very great rapidity
                    in a per-<br/> -pendicular direction 150 <del>fifty</del> feet, and<br/> the
                    foaming state of the <geogname key="niagr">River</geogname> for many pearch<br/>
                    -es below, it was a trial and <del>looked</del> appeared dangerous<br/> to go to
                    the edge of the Rock, to look down; I<br/> did it by going on my hands and
                    knees,<br/> and at the edge I found the Rock was<br/> hollow under me for a
                    number of feet<br/> back, and not much above one foot<br/> thick, I would have
                    been glad to have<br/> descended to the bottom of this pitch, but<br/> we had no
                    pilat, and there was no possibility<br/> of getting down any where in view, nor
                    as<br/> I have understood short of half a mile down the<br/>
<geogname key="niagr">River</geogname> and there, with great difficulty.
                    After<br/> staying about 20 minutes to view this Awful &amp;<br/> grand Scene,
                    we return'd up the steep bank<br/> with difficulty, and in four miles arrived at<br/>

                    that<br/> the Work was stoped, the friend was much<br/> concerned about it, as

                    would be very usefull; we<br/> had no prospect of going so far, and
                        <del>our</del><br/> the time for our returning to <a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, fix-<br/> -ed, we felt cautious in any hasty result,

                    house, where we met with<br/> most of the Men professions likely to

                    time of renewed favour, many Minds were<br/> tendered, and the difficulties

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_120" n="118"></pb> amongst last fall, and found the

                    they would have been<br/> again visited this Summer, but when they were<br/>

                    general note of the face of the<br/> Country, Timber &amp;c. As far as I have
                    been <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_122" n="120"></pb> through it, in the general it is a
                    level<br/> Country, while in a state of Woods, much<br/> of it is Wet, with a
                    black mud on the<br/> top and a stiff Clay under, which<br/> Clay prevents the
                    Water from soaking<br/> down, when cleared in a dry time<br/> this Clay land
                        <del>beakes</del> bakes very hard &amp;<br/> is difficult tilling, tho in
                    other places the soil <del>it</del><br/> is <del>a</del> loamy <del>soil</del>.
                    The land in general is<br/> of a good quality and a fine grass land,<br/> good
                    springs of water are scarce, as are<br/> lively runing Streams: and the
                    Waters<br/> fail much in dry Weather. In places<br/> there are a plenty of a
                    coarse flinty<br/> Limestone, but in the general few stones<br/> are to be seen,
                    Scarcely a spot to be met<br/> with, except where it is cleaned, but what<br/>
                    is very heavy, Timbered Land. I do<br/> not recollect of ever passing through
                    a<br/> Country that has so large a proportion<br/> of clean, straight, beautiful
                    White lakes<br/> as a considerable part of this has; there<br/> are also a

                    Pine &amp;c. When the roads<br/> are first opened and used they are mostly<br/>

                    the Roots<br/> rotten and gone, they get pretty good, tho<br/> at present there
                    are amany deep places.<br/> as far as I can learn their Summers are plea-<br/>
                    -sant tho nearly, in the daytime, as warm<br/> as our own are, but the evenings
                    and<br/> nights mostly cool, so that a blanket &amp; Cover-<br/> -lit are not
                    often unpleasant sleeping<br/> under, -- there Winters are steady and more<br/>
                    Snow lies on the ground than in our parts, but<br/> in convesation with some who
                    moved out of<br/>
<del>these parts</del> the Jersyes and <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, they were of the Mind we have<br/>
<del>a</del> many days here, as cold as any they have there,<br/> but we have
                    more warm ones, their Win-<br/> -ters mostly set in towards the middle of
                    the<br/> 12th Mo, and in the forepart of winter they<br/> have frequent snows,
                    until the ground<br/> becomes 18, 20, or 24 Inches deep, but seldom<br/> more,
                    which snow continues without much additi-<br/> -on until the Middle of the third
                    Month, which <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_124" n="122"></pb> which is their pleasantest time for
                    traveling in<br/> the whole Year, they do their Carting and<br/> traveling much
                    with Sleds, the roads be-<br/> -come smooth and good, there are no swam ps<br/>
                    or mud in the way, neither is the snow<br/> often softened with rain in the
                    Winter,<br/> some seasons they have had very little or no<br/> frost in the
                    Ground; and as far as they have<br/> tryed Cover, they say it <del>does</del>
                    answers very well, not<br/> being hurt in the winter, with frost.</p>
<p> About 9 O Clock this morning we took leave<br/> of our kind, and Valued friends
                        <a href="/people/ascho1">Asa Schooly<persname key="ascho1"></persname></a><br/> and Wife, with their
                    children, hav-<br/> -ing their, and many friends, hearty<br/> Wishes for our

<a href="/people/dpoun1">Daniel Pounds<persname key="dpoun1"></persname></a>, a little while, then tak-<br/>
                    -ing our leave of them, <del>and</del> set of down<br/> the <geogname key="lakee">Lake</geogname> for <a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>,
                    &amp; arrived at the fer-<br/> -ry about 12 where we found the Chief fer-<br/>
                    -ryman, so in Liquor as not to be fit to<br/> take any Care, but a trusty Old
                    man who<br/> sometimes Assisted agreed to take us over,<br/> the Wind was pretty
                    high, and the <geogname key="niagr">River</geogname><br/> ran swift, he
                    concluded to lash two boats<br/> together to keep the one our horse

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_125" n="123"></pb> in Studier, which was very acceptable
                    to<br/> us, having found when we Crossed before <del>were going</del><br/>
<del>over,</del> that it was a dangerous ferry, and<br/> rocking boat; but now
                    on our return<br/> we went over very steady, tho the Current beat<br/> us down
                    the <geogname key="niagr">River</geogname> ¾ of a Mile, shortly<br/> after we
                    had got on Shore, and mounted, we<br/> saw a man at a great distance towards<br/>
<a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, coming riding towards us, whom<br/>
                    we presently knew to be our <a href="/people/ijohn1">Indian John<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a><br/>
                    who was coming to <del>meet</del> look for us, he appeared<br/> much pleased to
                        <del>see</del> meet us, as we did to see him,<br/> and to find that our Mare
                    was safe. ----</p>
<p> We got to <a href="/places/buffa">Buffoloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> about 2 OClock and<br/>
                    tho a Day later than we agreed to meet<br/>
<a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> here, yet neither he nor any
                    of<br/> his company were come, -- about Sunset<br/> his Son <a href="/people/habee1">Henry<persname key="habee1"></persname></a>, and another Indian arrived<br/> and informed
                    us that <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, and<br/> 10 or 12 more
                    were on there way, and would<br/> be here by 10 OClock tomorrow, 15 miles</p>

<p> About 12 OClock <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and his<br/>
                    company arrived at the Opposite side of <a href="/places/buffa">Buf-

                    across, they appeared please d <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_126" n="124"></pb> to see us, <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> enquiring after our<br/> health since we left him,
                    he gave us<br/> a letter from our friends dated 5 days<br/> after we came away,
                    informing they<br/> were well in health, and enjoyed a<br/> peaceful Mind, that
                    they had got their<br/> Corn planted, and were preparing ground<br/> for
                    Popatoes, that there had been much<br/> rain since we left them, and that
                    the<br/> gnats and Muschetoes were more trou-<br/> blesome than heretofore.</p>
<p>
<a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> having got some information
                    that<br/> we were a little uneasy about staying<br/> as none of <a href="/people/rmorr1">Robert Morris<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a>'s Commissi-<br/> -oners were arrived,
                        <del>he</del> this Afternoon<br/> &gt;he took an Oppertunity with us,
                    Observing<br/> that he expected by this time we had seen<br/> enough of the
                    Wilderness to <del>form</del> know, that were<br/> people were to be collected
                    from diffi-<br/> -rent parts to do publick business, it<br/> required time, and
                    he hoped if <a href="/people/ichap1">Cap- -tain Chapin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a> should not
                    arrive this evening <del>to night</del>, <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_127" n="125"></pb> we would try to make ourselves as
                    hap-<br/> -py as we could, and stay a few days long<br/> -er, for he had a great
                    desire we should<br/> be with them at the Council, and see<br/> that all things
                    were settled fairly, then we<br/> would be able to inform our friends at

                    inform our friends. It brought<br/> a close exercise over our Minds to know
                    what<br/> was best to do, a number of the Indians<br/> were collected, yet it
                    looked likely it <del>was</del><br/> would be some time before all parties<br/>
                    would get together, as none of the White<br/> people immeadeately concerned
                    were<br/> come. We let him know we would have<br/> been glad to have attended
                    the Council, but<br/> it was now drawing towards the latter end<br/> of the
                    Week, and <del>that</del> the White people did<br/> not do business on first
                    day, that it was<br/> not very likely <del>that</del>
<a href="/people/ichap1">Captain Chapin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a> &amp;c<br/> would

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_128" n="126"></pb> Closely to consider the subject

<p> Having attended to <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanters<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> re-<br/>
                    -quest, of last evening, I felt my Mind<br/> this Morning easy to move
                    homewards, but<br/> upon mentioning it to my Companion<br/> he said he did not
                    witness that clear-<br/> -ness to set out he wished to experience<br/> yet
                    condescended if I thought best of<br/> letting the Chief know, that upon<br/>
                    weighing his request in the best man-<br/> -ner we could, We felt easy to
                    move<br/> homewards this morning; this infor-<br/> -mation was given him by
                    walking<br/> down to his encampment, he with a<br/> number of others pretty soon
                    came up to<br/> our lodgings, and let us know, he was<br/> sorry we could not
                    make our Minds easy<br/> to have stayed a few days longer, no ways<br/> doubting
                    but <a href="/people/ichap1">Captain Chapin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a> and others concerned<br/>
                    would be here to day; but perhaps<br/> as we had been a considerable time
                        <del>fr</del><br/> from home, and living was expensive,<br/> we might be
                    much run out of the means <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_129" n="127"></pb> that enabled us to stay, which made<br/>
                    us so anxious to return. I informed<br/> him, when I left home, I expected to
                    have<br/> returned in about 40 days, that it was now<br/> near 50 days, and if
                    we went by <a href="/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a><br/> to see the Indians
                    there, which we proposed,<br/> it would take near 30 days more before we<br/>
<del>got</del> could get home, that our Circumstances as<br/> to money was not
                    in the way, for we had<br/> plenty. he said he had left home on pub-<br/> -lic
                    Business, expecting to have return-<br/> -ed in 50 or 60 days, and it had taken
                    him<br/> near a Year before he had got back, and<br/> that he had found it his
                    duty to sacrafice<br/> privet conveniency to public good;<br/> and he would have
                    us do so too:<br/> we let him know, the business we came<br/> about appeared to
                    be agreeable settled<br/> to both their and our Minds, that this o-<br/> -ther
                    business, was something we knew<br/> nothing of <del>about</del> untill since
                    among<br/> them, that we would have been will-<br/> -ing to have set with them
                    in Coun-<br/> -cil, tho did not know we could be of<br/> any <del>use</del>
                    service to them, and that the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_130" n="128"></pb> business between him and <a href="/people/ichap1">Captain Cha- -pin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a> relating to a Mill, we
                    thought<br/> when he and the Captain conferred to<br/> -gather on the Subject,
                    we might be ful-<br/> -ly informed of their result by letter.<br/> he then
                    informed us he was become per-<br/> -fectly reconciled to our going, and as<br/>
                    the Council was expected every<br/> day to meet, he could not go with us<br/> to
                        <a href="/places/canan">Canandargue<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, as he had proposed,<br/> but
                    that <a href="/people/ijohn1">John<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a>, who had hitherto been<br/> with us,
                    would go through to the <geogname key="genes2">Che-<br/> -nesee
                    River</geogname>, and that he wished the<br/> good Spirit who had hitherto
                    pre-<br/> -served us, would safely keep us on our<br/> Journey, until we arrived
                    at our own<br/> homes, he further desired we would<br/> make ourselves,
                    perfectly easy about<br/> our Young Men, who were left a-<br/> mong his People,
                    for he would take<br/> the necessary care of them, and that they<br/>
<del>and that</del> would be entirely safe.</p>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_131" n="129"></pb>
<p> We now took An affectionate farewell of<br/> the Chief, and the Indians present,
                    who<br/> parted with us with much respect; and<br/> I can truly say, the longer
                    I have been<br/> among that People, the more near and<br/> united they have felt
                    to me, and <del>that</del><br/> now on parting, the felt like bretheren<br/>
<del>like</del> with whom I <del>have</del> had been intamate<br/> -ly
                    acquainted, and for whose wellfare<br/> I feel ardant Wishes. ----</p>
<p> About 8 O Clock we left <a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, hav-<br/>
                    -ing a fine day to enter the Wilderness,<br/> and there having been about a
                    Week<br/> of dry weather, the road was this day<br/> pretty good, so that with
                    industry we<br/> traveled by computation 45 miles.</p>
<p> Much of this days ride was through a country<br/>
<del>land of</del> very <del>little or no</del> thinly timbered, wich was<br/>
                    grown over with plenty of pretty good grass,<br/> so that I thought thousands of
                    Cattle might<br/> have fattened upon it, if it was not for a<br/> certain
                    species of large flies, and Musche-<br/> -toes, we stoped twice to let our
                    horses eat <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_132" n="130"></pb> grass, but they were so Worried with
                    these<br/> Animals, that the did little but run about<br/> until we got bushes
                    and kept them of.<br/> If we stoped our horses one Minute in<br/> some places in
                    the Woods, the Musche-<br/> -toes would be on them in such swarms<br/> as almost
                    to hide their natural Colour,<br/> and none but those who have experienced<br/>
<del>it</del> the trial can rightly form an Idea, how trou-<br/> blesome the
                    were to the Rider, I cou-<br/> -vered my head, neck, and most of my<br/> face
                    with my Silk handkerchief, laped<br/> my Pocket do: around one of my hands<br/>
                    and with all the <del>other</del> defence I could<br/> make was much bit and
                    Swelled with<br/> them, -- When Night came <del>an</del> we got<br/> no relief,
                    we took up our quarters, a-<br/> -bout Sunset, beside a small stream<br/> of
                    good Water, under the Boughs of an<br/> Oak, and erected fires, in
                    diffirent<br/> places around us in order to smoke<br/> them of, but with all our
                    defence we<br/> were worried the whole night throug[h] <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_133" n="131"></pb> So that we slept but little, our
                    horses,<br/> as may readily be supposed, fared no<br/> better, they would away
                    out to eating,<br/> and then in a little time return trot-<br/> -ting back to
                    the fire, and it was with with<br/> much difficulty we got them sad-<br/> -dled
                    in the Morning. 45 miles </p>

<p> Set of early this Morning, being willing<br/> to leave Muschetoe Camp, the road
                    not<br/> so good as Yesterday, having a large<br/> number, of deep Swamps, and
                    about 20 miles of <del>a</del> thick<br/> woods to pass through, wherein we
                    found no diminution<br/> of the Muschetoes, but about noon we ar-<br/> -rived
                        <del>in</del> at the plains within 8 miles of<br/> the <geogname key="genes2">Chenesee River</geogname>, where our horses<br/> could eat
                    grass without much molestati-<br/> -on having left the big flys and the o-<br/>
                    -ther tormenting insects chiefly behind us.</p>
<p> We crosed the <geogname key="genes2">River</geogname> about 4, on the flats<br/>
                    of which there was a great burden of natu-<br/> -ral grass, and about the Road
                    Timothy &amp;<br/> Clover, the seed having droped from horses<br/> as the
                    traveled along, I lodged at Pearsons<br/> 4½ Miles on this side the River,
                    having left <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_134" n="132"></pb> my Companion a few miles behind on<br/>
                    special business. 35 miles.</p>
<p> The Richness of the Soil between <a href="/places/buffa">Buf-

<del>has</del> is no<br/> way lessoned in my view by riding<br/> through it at
                    this time, but the first<br/> Settlers will meet with a great trial<br/> in the
                    Summer Season from the In<br/> -sects I have mentioned, but when the<br/>
                    Country becomes Settled, the low places<br/> Cleared, and dry, that affliction
                    will<br/> I believe cease, for I saw very little stag-<br/> -nated Water, --
                    much of this Country<br/> is scarce of Springs, or streams of<br/> Water, and
                    what there is very much<br/> fails in dry Seasons, so that its va-<br/>
                    -luableness will be greatly lessened<br/> thereby.</p>

<p> About noon <a href="/people/jpier1">John Peirce<persname key="jpier1"></persname></a> arrived at<br/> my
                    Quarters, he having since I left him<br/> had a full interview with <a href="/people/ichap1">Captain Chapin<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a>, who is the superintendant
                    of<br/> the Indians for the united States, <a href="/people/jpier1">John<persname key="jpier1"></persname></a><br/> gave him a full information <del>with</del> of what <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_0135" n="133"></pb> we had been doing at <a href="/places/cornp">Cornplanters set- -tlement<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>, and an account of
                    the Young<br/> Men we had left there, the <a href="/people/ichap1">Captain<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a> ex-<br/> pressed great satisfaction with our pro-<br/>
                    ceedings, and thought there was encouragement<br/> to extend labour towards that
                    people, for<br/> he had been sometime past through the<br/> Oneida settlement
                    and he apprehended he<br/> saw considerable improvement since <del>o</del><br/>
                    friends extended care there.</p>
<p> About 2 O Clock we sat of towards <a href="/places/canan">Canan-
                        -darque<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, and for 9 or 10 miles we passed through<br/> a thick
                    settled, highly improved Country,<br/>
<del>for</del> considering the settlement <del>to be</del> was no more than 10
                    years<br/> old, which to me was very animating,<br/> having for 300 miles past
                    been mostly in<br/> the Wilderness where improvments were<br/> not to be seen,
                    here we had beautiful Timo-<br/> -thy, and Clover fields almost Constantly<br/>
                    in view, with a good appearance of wheat<br/> Indian Corn, flax, Oates &amp;c.
                    these we shewed<br/> to our <a href="/people/ijohn1">Indian guide<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a>, he
                    alighted to examine<br/> the heads of Wheat, we shewed him the flax
                        <del>that</del><br/> that Shirts &amp;c. were made of, with which he<br/>
                    appeared pleased, we saw four Men howing corn<br/> these we pointed to, telling
                    him they were not <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_136" n="134"></pb> Squas, or Women, and that was the
                    way<br/> the White People did their Work, he<br/> knew our meaning, which he
                    expressed<br/> by a lively smile. We now parted with<br/> him, having traveled
                    together 170 miles<br/> he going on for <a href="/places/canan">Canandarque<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, and<br/> &gt;we for <geogname key="mudcr">Mud

                    where our Young<br/> are Settled, whom <a href="/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> said, as<br/> heretofore noted, was a sober Man,
                    like<br/> ourselves, <del>he</del> would drink no Whiskey, we<br/> have had some
                    oppertunity of proving<br/> this Assertion, being several days<br/> with him at
                    the Tavern, at <a href="/places/buffa">Buffoloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a><br/> were the Indians
                    were drinking Spirits<br/> and I did not see him meddle with any
                    <del>it</del>.</p>
<p> We now left the State road, turning to<br/> our left through a Country but
                    little in-<br/> -habitted, an open Woods, and thin land<br/> until within 2
                    miles of <geogname key="mudcr">Mud Creek</geogname>, here<br/> was heavy timber
                    and good land, we<br/> lodged at <a href="/people/jsmit1">Jacob Smiths<persname key="jsmit1"></persname></a>

<p> Set of early this morning, passed throu gh<br/>
<del>about</del> 13 miles, of a light soil, thinly timber-<br/> -ed, some of
                    which was pitch pine, being the<br/> first we have seen for several hundred<br/>
                    miles past, thence 8 or 9 miles through<br/> a very rich beautiful limeston
                    country all<br/> thick Woods, we have now entred what<br/> is called the
                    Mililary Lands in <a href="/places/onoco">Onanda- -ga County<placename key="onoco"></placename></a>,
                    and I do not recollect of ever<br/> seeing 8 miles of Land more beautifull<br/>
                    both for situation, and quality, and tim-<br/> -ber than this, - As I rode over
                    it I anticipated <del>contem-</del><br/>
<del>-plated</del> the time, when this land will be<br/> crouded with We althy
                    Farmers, abound-<br/> -ing with large stocks of Cattle &amp;c. Vieing each<br/>
                    other with their fields of Wheat, Corn, Grass &amp;c<br/> &gt;&amp; regaleing
                    themselves around their Tables<br/> richly loaded with provision. --- Here
                    we<br/> arrived at the outlet of <geogname key="senec">Seneca Lake</geogname>, a
                    stream <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_140" n="138"></pb> perhaps <del>at</del> as large as three
                    of <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>, when<br/> we first came on the
                    River it looked very deep<br/> and glided along with an easy current,<br/> but
                    in a little time we came to a rapid a<br/> Mile in length, on which are
                    erected<br/> an Elegant Merchant Mill, and a<br/> Sawmill that appeared to do a
                    great<br/> deal of Business, the stand <del>appeared</del><br/>
<del>to me</del> is very valuable, as the Co unt<unclear>ry</unclear><br/> round
                    is fertile, and suitable for<br/> raising Wheat, salt and goods of va-<br/>
                    -rious kinds are boated up this River<br/> to a little below the Mill, then
                    Cart-<br/> -ed above the rapids, and from thence<br/> taken by boat
                        <del>up</del> into the <geogname key="senec">Seneca Lake</geogname>, which
                    is<br/> 40 miles in length and opens into<br/> a very fine Country, we were
                    informed<br/> that this stream seldom rises more than<br/> Six Inches with any
                    fresh, the <geogname key="senec">Lake</geogname><br/> forming a large bason
                    which contains<br/> the freshes, <del>and is</del>
<del>which is let out gra-</del><br/>
<del>-dually,</del> -- thence to <geogname key="cayug">Cyuga Lake</geogname>
                    three<br/> miles, here we fed our horses and cooked<br/> our own Breakfast, we
                    then crossed sd. La[ke] <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_141" n="139"></pb> in a Boat, a little above its outlet, it
                    be-<br/> -ing one mile <del>across</del> wide, and 13 or 14 feet deep<br/> we
                    were informed the <geogname key="cayug">Lake</geogname> was 45 miles<br/> long,
                    and in places four Miles Wide, we now<br/> entred a pretty thick settled
                    Country, consi-<br/> -derably improved, the Land still very good<br/> with
                    plenty of Limestone, and in eight miles<br/> crossed a large lively stream
                        <del>which <gap></gap></del><br/>

<geogname key="owasc">Lake</geogname> is 12 miles long and one broad; about 1 ½<br/>
<del>miles</del> miles on this side we fed at <del>one</del> Good-<br/> -riches,
                    thence to Carpenters 10½ miles over<br/> a very fine Country pretty well
                    watered<br/> which has not been the case <del>which has not been the case</del>
                    for <del>until latterly</del><br/> many miles back which Country was
                    considerably settled, few of<br/> the improvments older than four years,<br/> I
                    have been much delighted in the last 15<br/> miles ride, in beholding the
                    beautiful and<br/> well grown fields of Wheat, Clover and Ti-<br/> -mothy mixed,
                    and lots of Corn, -- I thought<br/> one half of the Cleared Land was in with
                    grass<br/> and that many farmers would cut from<br/> 20 to 30 Tons of Hay. For
                    thirty miles back<br/> I think it is without exception the best body<br/> of
                    land I have seen since we left home. We<br/> got a five O Clock dinner at
                        <persname>Carpenters</persname>
<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_142" n="140"></pb> and then rode 6 miles to

                    mostly woods, here we Lodged<br/> cutting Clover and Timothy <del>grass</del>
                    for our horses with a sickle<br/>
<del>he having no pasture.</del> The grass is so stout, I thought it would have
                        <del><gap></gap></del> produce near three tons of hay to the Ac<gap></gap>
</p>
<p> The common practice of raising Corn,<br/> wheat &amp;c for many Miles past, is
                    to clear a piece<br/> Land, by cutting down nearly all<br/> the timber which
                    they heap and burn<br/> on the Spot, and when made clean, <del>they</del><br/>
                    Harrow the ground several times over,<br/> then they plant, and tend the Corn
                    with<br/> the Hoe never putting a plough in the<br/> ground, when the Corn comes
                    of, in the<br/> fall, they again harrow the ground several<br/> times, and then
                    sow it with wheat and<br/> Timothy, and often times some Clover seed, and when
                    the Wheat comes<br/> of, mow it for several years, by that time<br/> many of the
                    roots <del>get</del> are rotten, they then<br/> Plough and farm it as suits
                    best.<br/> 49 miles</p>

<del>as</del> here we fed our horses, and rested seve-<br/> -ral hours the day
                    being very Warm, as<br/> we descended a long hill down to this<br/> place we
                    killed a Rattle Snake about<br/> four feet long, as thick in the Middle
                        <del>as</del><br/> as a good pitchfork handle, but was<br/> much smaller

<a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscororas<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> are Scatteringly settled, most

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_146" n="144"></pb> Corn, Mowing ground &amp;c. with a

                    the Stockbridge Settlement, the<br/> prospect of their improvement was<br/> more
                    delightful, the have a large<br/> Street between two and three miles in<br/>

                    is mostly cleared, and<br/> fenced off in small Lots, which lots were in<br/>
                    with Wheat, Corn, Grass for Mowing, or<br/> for pasture: It is about nine
                    years<br/> since they settled here in the Woods,<br/> their first houses are
                    mostly small, and<br/> poor, some of them have latterly put up<br/> pretty good
                    houses, and others are pre-<br/> paring for it. The have pretty good<br/>

<del>that</del> so that they are well supplyed with<br/> Water, and towards the
                    South end<br/> of their Village, they have a Grist Mill,<br/> and a Sawmill,
                    their Grist mill does<br/> considerable work for the White People,<br/> and
                    their was a large quantity of logs<br/> and Boards, at the Sawmill. We
                    called<br/> to see most of the families of note a<del>mo</del><br/> mongst them,
                    also a School kept by <del>an Indian</del> a religious Indian Man with whom I

<del>Women</del>, many of the Women <del>whom</del>, were Solid,<br/> Sensible,
                    and engaging. there houses<br/> were clean with Wooden floors and Glass<br/>
                    Windows, themselves and Children mostly<br/> clean, and neat, and the Men and
                    Boys<br/> were hoeing corn &amp;c. I thought there was<br/> as much diffirence
                    between Cornplan-<br/> -ters people, and this nation; as betwee n<br/> these
                    People, and the better livers amon g<br/> the White People. We had a
                    favoured<br/> oppertunity with a number of the most <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_148" n="146"></pb> respectable Characters of both
                    their<br/> Men and Women, at the close of which,<br/> a Chief on the behalf of
                    the Men pre-<br/> -sent made a pretty lengthy Speech, in<br/> Substance;
                    expressing their thankful-<br/> -ness to the good Spirit who had put<br/> it
                    into our hearts to remember<br/> them when at a great distance, and<br/> had
                    preserved us in our way thither;<br/> that they felt themselves much
                    Streng-<br/> -thened by our good Words, that they<br/> were sensible they had
                    done that which<br/> was not right, yet hoped by the help<br/> of the good
                    Spirit they would do better for<br/> the future, and they Wished the Qua-<br/>
                    -kers, would continue to remember<br/> them, for they had found them to be<br/>
                    true Men, and that the realy had<br/> the poor Indians good at Heart, and<br/>
                    wished <del>that</del> the good Spirit would safely pre-<br/> -serve us on our

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_149" n="147"></pb> men present delivered a speach much<br/>
                    to the foregoing import, tho we thought it<br/> more weighty, and nervious, we

<p> Had a Council with the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida’s<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> this<br/>
                    afternoon, on Business that our friends here<br/> had been endeavouring to get
                    them together<br/> about for several Weeks past, but were<br/> not able to
                    accomplish it until we came,<br/> we made some fresh proposals to them con-<br/>
                    -cerning some of their young men coming to<br/> work on the farm with our
                    friends, they<br/> having never complyed with the proposals<br/> that were made,
                    when the friends first were<br/> there, as the consideration therein mentioned<br/>
<del>they were to receive</del> for their labour, they<br/> apprehended at too
                    great a difference, it be-<br/> -ing such a share of what was raised. There<br/>
                    were also some proposials concerning one<br/> or two of their Young Men coming
                    to learn <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_150" n="148"></pb> the Smith trade, all which they
                    said<br/> they would take under consideration and<br/> let us know tomorrow,
                    then they were clos[e]<br/> -ly expostulated with, concerning some Jea-<br/>
                    -louses they had entertained, occationed by<br/> some whisperings of evel Minded
                    White<br/> People, who told them the Quakers had<br/> some deep rooted design,
                    to <del>make</del> get pos-<br/> -session of their Lands, for they
                    certainly<br/> would not have been at the great expence<br/> they have, if they
                    did not expect some<br/> temporal advantage therefrom; they<br/> acknowledged
                    they had given too much place<br/> in their Minds to such Whisperings, and<br/>
                    that it had made them feel, to use there<br/> own expressions, very ugly, we let
                    them<br/> know that we would not have their Land<br/> if they would give it to
                    us, and that it was<br/> very unkind in them to have given place<br/> to such
                    surmisings without they had, had<br/> some ground for it <del>them</del>, they
                    acknow-<br/> -ledged they had found us to be true Men,<br/> that we Spoke the
                    same words to them<br/> now, we Spoke <del>two</del> too them two years ago <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_151" n="149"></pb> and that they would Shut their Ears to
                    all<br/> such Whisperings in future. Then said, they<br/> had been trying to
                    improve in farming, and<br/> if they did not come forward as fast, and as<br/>
                    well as <del>we desired</del> the Quakers desired,<br/> they must not get
                    discouraged, but conti-<br/> -nue there care, and Assistance towards them.</p>
<p> Upon enquiring of our young Men here, they<br/> informed us there was some
                    improvment a-<br/> -mong the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida’s<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> since they
                    came, tho<br/> not such as they wished to have seen, they<br/> Plough more, and
                    fence more, they sow more<br/> Wheat, and have more lots of Meadow. They<br/>
                    are computed young and old <del>to amount to</del> at<br/> about 600, and are
                    scattered 10 or more miles<br/> distant, tho their largest number is with-<br/>
                    -in two miles of this place. They have a<br/> large enclosure here of perhaps
                    200 Acres,<br/> wherein the keep their horses, of which they<br/> have more than
                    necessary, their Cows, and<br/> Swine; and in said enclosure are many of<br/>
                    their Horses, and they plant their Corn, sow<br/> their Wheat and Oates, and
                    have their mea-<br/> -dow lots without, but this mode of farm-<br/> -ing, it
                    looks likely they will have to change<br/> before long, for the have sold their
                    Lands, <br/>

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_153" n="151"></pb> us they had found one lad or Young Man,

                    miles, and from one to two in breadth,<br/> as we returned to <a href="/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a> next Morning<br/> We beheld its destructive

                    miles, it was affecting to see<br/> the destruction it made: whole fields<br/>
                    of wheat were entirely cut off, so that<br/> we could not see one head standing,
                    corn,<br/> Flax, and Oates fared but little better, Peas<br/> in the Gardens and
                    fields, Acres being<br/> Sown here, were entirely <del>cut off,</del>

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_156" n="154"></pb> broken down that they smelled like<br/>

                    which were knocked all<br/> to pices, the stalks which were as thick<br/> as
                    rake handles were broke, in short<br/> all vegetation where the storm
                    reched<br/> suffered much; the fences, stumps, &amp;<br/> Old logs were much
                    marked: the Win-<br/> -dows of a number of houses were very<br/> much destroyed,
                    one place of Worshi[p]<br/> we understood had more than 300<br/> lights

<p> A fine Morning, and a pleasant day<br/> for traveling: about 8 or 9 miles of a
                    fine<br/> Country down the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname>, the poorly
                    farmed<br/> buildings not near so good as further back,<br/> thence 5 miles to
                    Adridges where we got<br/> our Breakfasts, through land equally<br/> as good,
                    and much better farmed, with<br/> some large buildings; both spring and<br/>
                    Winter Wheat good, also the Corn; and fine<br/> meadows loaded with the best of
                    Grass; the<br/>
<geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname> at times close on our right, which<br/>
                    flowed along with a gentle Current, appeard<br/> pretty deep, tho not much wider

<pb facs="SW_JS1798_157" n="155"></pb>
<geogname key="brand">dywine</geogname>, this was through what is called the<br/>
<a href="/places/gefla">German flatts<placename key="gefla"></placename></a>. We passed through the
                    County<br/> Town of <a href="/places/herki">Hackamack<placename key="herki"></placename></a>, and so over
                    the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname><br/> on a Bridge to the southside one
                    mile be-<br/> -fore we fed. thence 14 miles to Teevendurfs<br/> over high, dry,
                    Stony Land, Buildings mostly<br/> poor, as was allso the grass and other
                    Crops;<br/> we now left the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname> at some
                    distance to our left.<br/> About three miles back we went by a<br/> pretty
                    elegant House, now occupied by<br/> the <orgname>prespeterians </orgname>, it
                    was built by <a href="/people/wjohn3">William Johnson<persname key="wjohn3"></persname></a> before the
                    French and Indian War<br/> as a place of Worship for the Indians.</p>
<p> In about one Mile <del>from</del> after we left Teevendurff’s<br/> having passed
                    through a fine flat, we rode<br/> the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname>
                    which had increased much in<br/>
<del>weadth</del> Width, the flat still Continuing,<br/> in one mile we left it,
                    and passed over 6 or<br/> 7 miles of a Stony, rough, poor Country,<br/> except
                    some bottoms on the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname>, the build-<br/>
                    -ings also poor, then 7 or more miles, fine<br/> bottoms loaded with grass, and
                    various<br/> sorts of grain; thicksettled near the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname><br/> with many good Buildings, more particu-<br/> -larly
                    on the south side. the latter part <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_158" n="156"></pb> &gt;part of this stage the Mountains, or
                    high roc[ky]<br/> Hills crouded near to the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname>, so that<br/> inplaces there was scarcely room for a<br/>

<p> A pleasant ride 2 or more Miles down<br/> a rich bottom all under Culture. the
                    scar-<br/> -city of Railtimber has induced many far-<br/> -mers on this
                        <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname> to hang gates at certain<br/> places
                    instead of fencing each side of the<br/> road, so that Corn, Wheat, Peas &amp;c
                    comes close<br/> up to the road side, which causes a delight-<br/> -ful
                    appearance where Croops are good. fro[m]<br/> thence to Degraph’s 17½ miles this
                    stage; the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_159" n="157"></pb> Land mostly stony, some of it very
                    rough,<br/> and but little bottom land on the river, the<br/> Buildings mean,
                    and Farming poor. ----</p>
<p> I have often admired since we came on<br/> this <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname> to see such large heaps of Ashes<br/> remaining untucked,
                    where there has<br/> been for Years past Pot-Ash Manufacture<br/> carried on,
                    they convey to the traveler,<br/> that the people have no Idea, the land<br/>
                    would be benefitted by spreding them over<br/> it, or otherwise, that they are
                    to lazy to do it.<br/> A few miles back some Men were hoeing<br/> very poor Corn
                    in a field, where I had no<br/> doubt there were 3; or 400 Loads of Ashes<br/>
                    in a heap untuched, I called aloud <del>to</del><br/> to them to know why they
                    did not<br/> spread the heap of Ashes over the field<br/> and so have good corn,
                    and not be hoe-<br/> -ing such poor stuff as that was; they stod like<br/> Men
                    amazed, made no reply, and we passed<br/> on, -- And a few miles further on we
                    saw<br/> a large pottash Works close on the <geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname><br/> so that when the Ashes were thrown out of the<br/>
                    Tubs they went into the <del>River</del> Water, and were drive[n]<br/> of with
                    freshes <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_160" n="158"></pb> thence to <a href="/places/schen">Shenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> 13½ miles, the<br/> land thin and stony, with but
                    little<br/> bottom land on the River. We had the<br/> water often in view, and
                    tho we have<br/> seen but few streams of Consequence<br/>
<del>that</del> which <del>o</del> run into the <a href="/places/mohaw">River<placename key="mohaw"></placename></a> since we left<br/>
<a href="/places/fschy">Fort Scuylar<placename key="fschy"></placename></a>, yet it has increased very<br/>
                    much in Width. Where we lodged last<br/> night, our Landlord said it was
                    but<br/> 60 Yards Wide, in many places since<br/> I supposed it to be from 100
                    to 150, and<br/> at <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> where we
                    ferryed it, we<br/> were informed it was 60 pearches wide.</p>
<p> The town made a pretty appear-<br/> -ance from the Opposite Shore; it is
                    si-<br/> -tuated close on the south side of the<br/>
<geogname key="mohaw">River</geogname>, appeared to be a considera-<br/> -ble
                    place, with many good buildings<br/> we did not stop in the town <del>it</del>,
                    desireing to<br/> &gt;go where we could get grass for our horses<br/> &gt;&amp;
                    understanding there were plenty of<br/> Taverns on towards <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, we pro-<br/> -ceeded forwardward, but we
                    found the<br/> country was to poor to <del>to</del> produce good <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_161" n="159"></pb> grass, for it was a perfect sand bed,
                    ex-<br/> -cept some swamps, nearly all the way to<br/>
<a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and thinly timbered with Pitch<br/>
                    Pine, and as thinly Inhabitted, being<br/> but 10 or 12 houses for 15 miles. and
                    each of them a Tavern When Evening<br/> came we were hard put to for good
                    Quar-<br/> -ters, within 1½ miles of <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>
                    we found at the Wi-<br/> -dow Scotts, pretty good pasture, but<br/> the House
                    and things in it looked very<br/> discouraging, however we fared <del>found it
                        a</del><br/>
<del>place of</del> better <del>quarters</del> than we expected.<br/> This has
                    been a trying days ride, the Road<br/>
<del>were</del> was very dusty, and the Wind with us, so<br/> that we were much
                    smothered. 45 miles</p>

                    Early this morning we passed<br/> through two considerable red Cedar

                    the<br/> Bridge over it was near fifty Yards long<br/> and twenty feet from the

                    falls of this kind are very <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_166" n="164"></pb> common on most of the Water in this
                    part<br/> of the Country. --- As we advanced South-<br/> -ward, the Land
                    improved in quality, and<br/> the Wonderful Ridges of Rocks, that were<br/> so
                    very common further back, grew fewer,<br/> yet stones rather Increased; tho most
                    of the<br/> land in the latter part of this stage is<br/> Arable, more
                    especially after the Stones<br/> are drawn of, which in divers places<br/> have
                    been done and put up in stone fen-<br/> -ces. The Plaister of Paris has been
                    latter<br/> -ly introduced into these parts and answers<br/> very well. We
                    arrived at <a href="/people/sbald1">Samuel Bald- -wins<persname key="sbald1"></persname></a> about four
                    Oclock, weary, and glad<br/>
<del>glad</del> we were got to a friends house. The<br/> weather latterly has
                    been very warm, and we<br/> having travelled hard from <a href="/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>, both<br/> us and our horses wanted Rest, we
                    conclud-<br/> -ed to lay by here a day or two, in order to get<br/> them Shod,
                    and to help these backs which were<br/> a little sore. -- <a href="/places/jpier1">John Pierce<placename key="jpier1"></placename></a>, having at times<br/> &gt;for some weeks
                    past, hinted to me, that he had<br/> some wish before we returned home, to
                    go<br/> over the <geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname> to see the school
                    at<br/> the <a href="/places/9part">Nine partners<placename key="9part"></placename></a>, but since we left

                    such, that we <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_167" n="165"></pb> put it by. But on our arrival here,

<p> Set of early this Morning through<br/> a pretty good Country, and fine
                    Roads<br/> to Jacksons, 18 miles, here we fed our hor-<br/> -ses and got a
                    second breakfast. We pass-<br/> -ed by four large places of Worship this<br/>
                    Morning; and a number of good houses<br/> and Barns, the land level and
                    pretty<br/> clear of stones. A Chain of Mountains<br/> were steadily in view on
                    our right, at ten<br/> or miles distant; and we left <a href="/places/newbu">newburgh<placename key="newbu"></placename></a>,<br/> and <a href="/places/nwind">New
                        Windsor<placename key="nwind"></placename></a> 8 or 10 miles to our left.<br/> More Swamp Meadow for
                    the last 14 miles<br/> than for 100 before. A large proportion<br/> of the land
                    was sown with wheat, which<br/> was mostly light. Not so much Rye as<br/>
                    further back. Thence throug good land,<br/> thick settled, and a beautiful
                    country to<br/>
<a href="/places/goshe">Goshen<placename key="goshe"></placename></a>, the County Town of <a href="/places/orang">Orange County<placename key="orang"></placename></a>. </p>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_169" n="167"></pb>
<p> Off a commanding eminence, a few miles<br/> before we got to this <a href="/places/goshe">Village<placename key="goshe"></placename></a>, we had an<br/> extensive Prospect, to the
                    West, to the<br/> South, and to the East, I expect the Eye<br/> reached 20 miles
                    each way, over a level<br/> looking Country, much improved. In<br/> the
                    neighbourhood of this <a href="/places/goshe">Village<placename key="goshe"></placename></a>, lies a
                    large<br/> proportion of valuable Meadows, and<br/> shortly after we left the
                        <a href="/places/goshe">Town<placename key="goshe"></placename></a> I observed all<br/> the fences, both
                    Pot, and Rail, and Worm<br/> fences, were made of nice Ceder Rails,<br/> and
                    upon enquiry I was informed, in what<br/> is called the drowned Lands, there is
                    a<br/> Ceder Swamp of Several thousand Acres,<br/> which supplys the country for
                    several miles<br/> round. A very valuable source. In 6 miles<br/> over land more
                    rough and hilly we got<br/> to <a href="/places/flori">Florida<placename key="flori"></placename></a> a
                    place of several good buildings<br/> where we fed. Water for our horses to
                    drink<br/> at has been very scarce these two last stages.</p>
<p> Thence 12 miles to Doctor Cooes, where<br/> we Lodged, over a hilly, Stony
                    Country,<br/> a great abundance of Limestone the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_170" n="168"></pb> latter part of this stage. Rye the
                    most<br/> common Winter grain. We are now<br/> in the Jerseys 3 or 4 miles South
                    of the<br/> New York line, having travelled in <del>sd</del><br/> York State
                    upwards of 500 miles</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1798-07-05">5th</date>. <placename key="newto"></placename></dateline>
<p> This has been the worst stage for our<br/> horses that we have met with since
                    we<br/> left <a href="/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>, and not very good for
                    our<br/> -selves. Went to Doctor Beeches 7 miles<br/> to Breakfast. very good.
                    Our last<br/> 7 miles was through a rough Country,<br/> a Considerable Mountain
                    close on our<br/> left, and a Valley on our right; most<br/> of the Land very
                    stony. Stone fences<br/> pretty frequent. The farmers have<br/> been very busy
                    for this Week past, in<br/> ploughing and hoeing their Corn, and<br/> in
                    ploughing for buckwheat; a large<br/> Quantity of this Grain, being sown here
                    away <del>in</del><br/>
<del>this Country</del>. A few Crops of good Wheat<br/>
<del>are</del> to be seen, but light crops of rye<br/> are more
                        <del>commonly</del> frequend. A Dutch<br/> Plough with one handle which
                    stands near-<br/> -ly upright, with a very short beam an[d] <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JS1798_171" n="169"></pb> pan Share, is almost the only plough
                        <del>such</del>, that<br/> is used for 200 miles back; they appear to<br/>
                    work easy both for the horses, and plough<br/> -man, and does their business
                    pretty neat.</p>
<p> Shortly after we left this stage we Cross-<br/> -ed the <geogname key="wallk">Wallkill</geogname>, fifty miles higher up than<br/> where we crossed it
                    firtday last, yet the<br/>
<geogname key="wallk">Stream</geogname> was so large, as to have a forge
                    erect-<br/> -ed on it a little above the fording place.<br/> In about 7 miles
                    further we Crossed the<br/>

                        <a href="/people/jlund1">Jacobs<persname key="jlund1"></persname></a>, the Land became more Ara-<br/>

                    immense tract of<br/> country to the American govern-<br/> ment, and became so
                    unpopular<br/> that his life was threatened by<br/> his tribe.</p>
