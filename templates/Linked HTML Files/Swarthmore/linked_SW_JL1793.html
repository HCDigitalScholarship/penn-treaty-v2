<a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>'s Account
                <p>Of a Journey to attend the Indian Treaty, pro<br/>-posed to be held at <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a> in the year <date when="1793">1793</date>;<br/> interspersed with various observations remarks,<br/> and
                    circumstances, that occurred on this inte-<br/>resting occasion. </p>
<label>INTRODUCTION</label>
<p>As preliminary information to the reader, it may<br/> be proper to state, that
                    about the year <date when="1791">1791</date>, a mis-<br/>understanding existed
                    between the United States,<br/> and several of the Indian Tribes. On this
                    occasion,<br/> the Meeting for Sufferings held in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, ad-<br/>dressed a memorial to Congress, the
                    object of which<br/> was, to show the expediency of pursuing
                    pacific<br/>measures towards settling the disputes with the In-<br/>dians. Their
                    representation was well received; —<br/> but the measures they recommended were
                    not then<br/>adopted; and the calamities of war still continuing to<br/>prevail
                    on the Western frontiers of the States,--<br/> the Yearly Meeting held in <date when="1792">1792</date>, appointed a large<br/>Committee, to unite with the
                    Meeting for Sufferings,<br/> in deliberating on this momentous subject, and
                    if<br/> practicable, to recommend such measures, as would<br/> be most likely to
                    promote peace and friendship with<br/> the Indians.</p>
<p>Early in the year <date when="1793">1793</date>, deputies from several
                    In-<br/>dian Nations, visited Philadelphia, with a view of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_050" n="50"></pb> forwarding an accommodation of
                    differences with<br/> the United States: and, Government having agreed<br/> that
                    a treaty should be held in the Indian country,<br/> near <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, during the summer following, — those<br/> Indian
                    deputies repeatedly urged that some Friends<br/> should attend the negociations,
                    stating, that “the<br/> Nations they represented had a special confidence<br/>
                    in Friends, as a people who, from their first settle-<br/>ment in America, had
                    manifested a steady adherence<br/> to the maintenance of peace and friendship
                    with the<br/> Natives.” In accordance with the desire which<br/> Friends had
                    long felt, to promote peace, the propo-<br/>sal was acceded to; and six Friends
                    were deputed to<br/> accompany the Commissioners appointed by govern-<br/>ment,
                    on this occasion, after having obtained the<br/> President's approbation.</p>
<p>The Commissioners appointed on this embassy<br/> were, <a href="/people/glinc1">general Benjamin Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cpic">colonel
                        Timothy Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/grand1">Beverly
                            Randolph<persname key="grand1"></persname></a>, Esq. The Friends<br/> who accompanied them, were,

<p>It was a close<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_051" n="51"></pb> trial to both, and the more so, as our
                    youngest child<br/> was much indisposed. But the resignation and for-<br/>titude
                    with which my beloved companion was sup-<br/>ported, helped me to bear the
                    separation beyond my<br/> expectation.</p>
<p>My beloved friend <a href="/people/jpuse1">Joshua Pusey<persname key="jpuse1"></persname></a>,
                    accompanied<br/> me from home. The morning was wet and windy.<br/> When we came
                    to <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>, it was high. We<br/> ferried
                    over, and got to Concord meeting; which<br/>opportunity tended to stay and quiet
                    my mind. —<br/> After meeting we went on to <a href="/places/darby">Darby<placename key="darby"></placename></a>, and lodged at<br/> our kind friend <a href="/people/jhunt1">John Hunt<persname key="jhunt1"></persname></a>'s, where, by him and<br/> his beloved
                        <a href="/people/rhunt1">Rachel<persname key="rhunt1"></persname></a>, we were tenderly cared for.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-04-29">29th</date><placename key="darby"></placename>.</dateline>
<p>We went to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, where I met with<br/>
<a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> and
                        <a href="/people/jmoor3">Jo-seph Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a>, who were to be my
                    fellow travellers<br/> in the journey. They informed me, that <a href="/people/cpic">Timothy Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/grand1">Beverly Randolph<persname key="grand1"></persname></a> proposed to set<br/> out on horseback next day.
                    On which information,<br/> it was mutually agreed, that <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>, should
                    proceed with them<br/> to <geogname key="niagf">Niagara Falls</geogname>: and
                        <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and myself<br/> proceed by
                    way of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> to accompany <a href="/people/glinc1">Benja-min Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, who had gone to <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> some days<br/>before.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-04-30">30th</date><placename key="phila"></placename>.</dateline>
<p>I felt my mind not quite easy to
                    proceed,<br/> without having an interview with the President of<br/> the United
                    States, which I suggested to <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Sa-very<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>, and found he was under a like impression. —<br/>
                    Accordingly, <a href="/people/jpemb1">James Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> and myself, went about nine
                    o'clock;<br/> met with a favourable reception, and had a full op-<br/>portunity
                    to relieve our minds: which we thought<br/> tended to his satisfaction, as well
                    as ours. About<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_052" n="52"></pb> one o'clock; our three friends and two
                    Commis-<br/>sioners set out on horseback.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-01">1st of 5th mo</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p><a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and myself, with<br/> five other passengers, set out in
                    the stage for <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. Got to
                        <a href="/places/bruns">Brunswick<placename key="bruns"></placename></a> about dark, having rode<br/>
                    sixty miles. Next day in the afternoon, we arrived<br/> at <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-03">3rd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Waiting for the baggage to come on by
                    wa-<br/>ter from <a href="/places/amboy">Amboy<placename key="amboy"></placename></a>, and providing for our
                    journey. I<br/> think I never saw Friends so active and heartily<br/> disposed
                    to comfort and assist, as were a number of<br/>our brethren and sisters of that
                    city.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-04">4th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Went on board the Schenectady sloop,
                        <a href="/people/clans1">Capt. Lansing<persname key="clans1"></persname></a>. Our beloved friend,
                        <a href="/people/whart1">William Hartshorne<persname key="whart1"></persname></a>,<br/> one of our
                    companions in this journey, met us here,<br/> and went on board also, at the
                        <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> pier in the<br/> East river. The
                    wind at southwest, we got round<br/> the point, and about five miles up the
                        <geogname key="nrive">North river</geogname>,<br/> when the wind shifted,
                    and a violent gale ensued<br/> from the north east. The tide also leaving us,
                    we<br/>were obliged to cast anchor, and lay tossing all night,<br/> just in
                    sight of the city. The wind increased so<br/> much that our vessel dragged her
                    anchor, and ran<br/> almost ashore. About daylight our captain ran in<br/> to
                    the wharf again. We took the opportunity of<br/> going to forenoon and afternoon
                    meetings. At the<br/>last of which, <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> desired to see Friends<br/> and others, at seven o'clock
                    in the evening. About<br/> which time, the streets being crowded with
                    people<br/> going to meeting, the captain sent a messenger to <br/>call us on
                    board. The strait indeed was great; but<br/> William and I agreed, let the
                    consequences be what<br/> they might, we would attend the meeting; we did<br/>
                    so, and a favoured time it was. About nine o'clock, <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_053" n="53"></pb> several Friends, merchants of the city,
                    accompanied<br/> us to the vessel, where the passengers and captain<br/> were in
                    a heat; but we kept down, and it blew over.<br/>
<a href="/people/clans1">Capt Lansing<persname key="clans1"></persname></a> told me afterwards with
                    seriousness,<br/> he did believe the storm was permitted in order to<br/> give
                    us time for the meeting.</p>
<p>About midnight they weighed anchor, and stood<br/> up the <geogname key="nrive">North river</geogname>. Our progress was slow and te-<br/>dious, which gave
                    us opportunity to view the rug-<br/>ged margin of that great water, which
                    exhibited sub-<br/>jects for awful contemplation. The rocks and moun-<br/>tains
                    rise from the water several hundred feet high;<br/> on the tops of divers of
                    which, are the remains of<br/> fortifications made in the time of the late war;
                    at<br/> some of which places, bloody contests had been<br/> held. We passed
                        <a href="/places/westp">West Point<placename key="westp"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/fputn">Fort
                        Putnam<placename key="fputn"></placename></a>, and <br/>divers others on the tops of the highest hills,
                    com-<br/>manding the prospects of diSirent reaches of the<br/>
<geogname key="nrive">North river</geogname>.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-07">7th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>We passed a stream tumbling over the
                    rocks<br/> into the river, called the <geogname key="buttf">Buttermilk
                        Falls</geogname> — a good<br/>seat for a mill. But the barren appearance of
                    the<br/>banks, with the prospect of the divers dark habita-<br/>tions of death
                    and destruction, brought me into a<br/> humbling sense of the excellency of that
                    holy reli-<br/>gion, which breathes peace on earth and good will<br/> to men.
                    The situation of these strong holds on the<br/>tops and peaks of mountains,
                    perhaps three or four<br/>hundred feet high, were associated with ideas
                    which<br/>more strongly confirmed my mind in the approach<br/>of that day, in
                    which the King of kings will exalt<br/>his holy mountain above them all.</p>
<p>Passed by <a href="/places/nwind">New Windsor<placename key="nwind"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/marlb">New Marlborough<placename key="marlb"></placename></a>, and<br/><a href="/places/barne">Barnagat<placename key="barne"></placename></a>. At the latter are many limekilns, which<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_054" n="54"></pb> burn lime for New York. The kilns are in
                    the<br/> bank, close to the river. <a href="/places/pough">Poughkeepsie<placename key="pough"></placename></a> is a village<br/> on the east side of the river.
                    The land appears bar-<br/>ren and shrubby, especially where the limestone<br/>
                    mostly abounds.</p></div>

                        <a href="/places/alban">Alba-ny<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, having sailed one hundred
                    miles in twelve hours.<br/> Last night we passed the city of <a href="/places/huds">Hudson<placename key="huds"></placename></a>, where a<br/> number of Friends reside. At
                        <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> we met with<br/> great civility.
                    The minister of the congregation in-<br/>troduced himself to us, and said he
                    wished our er-<br/>rand crowned with success; and that he would make<br/> it his
                    care, publicly to offer up his prayers for us,<br/> which would be joined by ten
                    or eleven hundred<br/> others, and he hoped would be available. He
                    ap-<br/>peared a good natured, tender spirited man. His<br/> name was <a href="/people/bass2">Bassett<persname key="bass2"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, five Indians passed through this<br/> town. I stopped them at
                    the city tavern, gave them<br/> some refreshment, and money to bear their
                    expenses.<br/> Their company consisted of an old woman, a son,<br/> two
                    daughters, and a grandson. One of the young<br/> women was named <a href="/people/mehet">Mehetable<persname key="mehet"></persname></a>, the other <a href="/people/ketur">Keturah<persname key="ketur"></persname></a>.<br/> Our secretary, Story, sent a written message to
                        <a href="/people/haupa1">Cap-tain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>, at the <geogname key="oneil">Oneida Lake</geogname>, by one of the<br/> young men, one
                    hundred and twenty miles distant:<br/> which he engaged to deliver in three
                    days. They all<br/> appeared simple, and their countenances innocent.<br/> Their
                    name and visage impressed my mind with a<br/> remembrance of good old Abraham,
                    Isaac and Jacob.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> is chiefly settled with the
                    de-<br/>scendants of emigrants from Holland. They are<br/> generally a recluse,
                    busy people: which bears the<br/> appearance of inhospitality, or want of
                    sociability <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_055" n="55"></pb> and attention to
                    strangers. When we arrived at the<br/> city tavern, we found <a href="/people/glinc1">general Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a> nearly alone.<br/> He was very
                    anxious to move forward that after-<br/>noon, for which purpose a horse and
                    chair was sought<br/> and procured: the horse was a poor old gray, such<br/> as
                    I have seen turned out to die. This treatment of<br/> the general roused my
                    feelings for the honour of our<br/> government, and the regard due to its
                    respectable<br/> officers: of which number I considered him as one —<br/>
                    especially on the present intended peaceful embassy.<br/> I then went out, and
                    represented the reflections it<br/> must draw upon the reputation of the place,
                    to <a href="/people/clans1">Capt. Lansing<persname key="clans1"></persname></a> and some others, who had
                    exulted much in<br/> the antiquity and reputation of their city. They<br/>
                    pretty soon procured a better horse and sulkey, and<br/> the old friend
                    proceeded that evening to <a href="/places/schen">Schenecta-dy<placename key="schen"></placename></a>.
                    We staid all night at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and
                    observed<br/> their manner of burial; where no women attended:<br/> neither do
                    they on any such occasions, attend the<br/> corpse of the nearest relative to
                    the grave. The<br/> females assemble at the house, and immediately af-<br/>ter
                    the coffin is borne out, they proceed to eat cakes,<br/> drink wine, and smoke
                    tobacco for a short time; and<br/> then all clear out before the men return. The
                    men<br/> resume the feast, made in consequence of the decease<br/> of their
                    neighbor or friend, regale themselves, and<br/> return home.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-09">9th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>We got into a wagon, and rode sixteen
                    miles<br/> to <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>, situated near the
                        <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname>. —<br/> We passed about ten
                    houses on the road, each a ta-<br/>vern. The land very poor and covered with
                    pines,<br/> the whole of the way. The town of <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> is<br/> supposed to consist of about three hundred
                    houses,<br/> mostly Dutch built, except some modern houses of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_056" n="56"></pb>more elegant construction. It appears
                    strange to see<br/> the manners and customs of the people, and the face<br/> of
                    the country: yet my mind is mercifully preserved<br/> in great quietude, and
                    every place looks and feels<br/> like a temporary home. Dined at a public house in<br/>
<a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>, where we had the pleasure of
                        <a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>'s company. After
                    dinner, we went on<br/> board a batteau, accompanied by seven others,
                    load-<br/>ed with our baggage and stores, and embarked on<br/> the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname>, in the presence of more than<br/> one
                    hundred spectators. Two of our boats were<br/> manned with six men each, the
                    other six boats with<br/> three men each. We proceeded about four miles,<br/>
                    and stopped at a house, where the mother and three<br/> children were entirely
                    insane. The three children<br/> never learned to speak, being idiots — the
                    mother<br/> went distracted, and was confined in chains. The<br/> several
                    circumstances attending this distressed fami-<br/>ly, deeply affected my mind,
                    and caused me secretly<br/> to acknowledge, that I was not thankful enough
                    for<br/> the manifold favours and blessings, mercifully dis-<br/>pensed to
                    me.</p>
<p>The bed of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname> I suppose to be<br/>
                    about two hundred yards across, and averaging three<br/> feet deep; some places
                    shoal and rapid, where the<br/> poor boatmen had very hard work to make
                    headway<br/> against the current. The river winds across a val-<br/>ley about
                    half a mile wide; alternately washing the<br/> southern and northern hills. The
                    bottoms in the<br/> bends, and on the banks of the river, are rich black<br/>
                    sand, exceeding fertile, and tolerably improved, pro-<br/>ducing wheat, Indian
                    corn, peas, flax, &amp;c in abun-<br/>dance. We had an agreeable prospect of a
                    range of<br/> fine plantations, interspersed with an abundance of<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_057" n="57"></pb>fruit trees in blossom. Vegetation
                    appeared about<br/>as forward here as when I left home. It is an old<br/>
                    settled country: the inhabitants mostly the descen-<br/>dants of Low Dutch
                    emigrants, and generally, speak<br/> that language, also, tolerable English.
                    They say it<br/> was settled before <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> or <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>;
                    which<br/> must be more than one hundred and twenty years.<br/> One young woman
                    told me, her father's great-grand-<br/>father was born on the place where she
                    then lived.<br/> The banks of the river, in general, rise about twelve<br/> or
                    fifteen feet above the surface of the water, and<br/> obscure, in a great
                    measure, the pleasing prospect<br/> of its fruitful margin from travelers who go
                    in boats.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-10">10th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Our little fleet, consisting of eight
                    boats,<br/> worked by thirty men, exclusive of twelve passen-<br/>gers, set out,
                    and with great exertions, opposed the<br/>rapids of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname> for about sixteen miles, through<br/> a champaign
                    country. Passed by many banks and<br/> points of land, memorable for having
                    forts and for-<br/>tifications, in time of war; particularly the old
                    resi-<br/>dence of Sir <a href="/people/wjohn3">William Johnson<persname key="wjohn3"></persname></a>, whose
                    mansion house<br/> is now in ruins — the lands confiscated, and in
                    pos-<br/>session of strangers. This estate was said to have<br/> been obtained
                    from the Indians by chicanery. Such<br/> is the uncertainty of the most
                    extensive worldly pos-<br/>sessions, more especially when obtained through
                    un-<br/>righteous channels. This day we passed a rock pro-<br/>jecting out of
                    the bank of the river, whereon was<br/> painted, with great ingenuity, in red
                    colours, a ca-<br/>noe with the representation of seven men in it.--<br/> Which
                    is said to be done annually, by Indians,<br/> coming several hundred miles for
                    that purpose, in<br/> order to commemorate the slaughter of seven In-<br/>dians,
                    who went off from that neighbourhood in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_058" n="58"></pb> some former wars, and were all destroyed.
                    We<br/> passed the mouth of the <geogname key="schoh">Schoharie</geogname>, and
                    stopped<br/> about a mile higher up the river, on a beautiful<br/> bank, where
                    we proposed to lodge. Here I saw a<br/> plough with two wheels, about eighteen
                    inches dia-<br/>meter, just before the coulter. They are in general<br/> use in
                    this neighbourhood, and appear to answer the<br/> end well. Their land is level,
                    light and rich near<br/> the river. Their field peas are just coming up,
                    and<br/> appear luxuriant, and beautiful.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-11">11th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had a fine wind, our little fleet hoisted
                    their<br/> sails, which propelled the boats against the current<br/> at about
                    four miles an hour, without the help of set-<br/>ting poles or oars. Passed the
                        <a href="/places/canaj">Canajoharie<placename key="canaj"></placename></a>, and a<br/> mountain called
                    the <geogname key="antho">Nose</geogname>, where is a remarkable<br/> cave, into
                    which one of our boatmen said he enter-<br/>ed about five perches, but found so
                    much wind issu-<br/>ing out of it, that he was afraid to proceed any
                    fur-<br/>ther. The land in this day's rout, is very good. The<br/> settlers here
                    were greatly distressed, about the year<br/>
<date when="1780">1780</date>, by the Indians and white people who were<br/>
                    opposed to the principles of the revolution, and were<br/> influenced, and, in
                    some instances, commanded, by<br/>
<a href="/people/jjohn4">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn4"></persname></a> (son of Sir <a href="/people/wjohn3">William<persname key="wjohn3"></persname></a>) who took refuge<br/> with the British, and
                    came on with a party of In-<br/>dians, &amp;c. into his old neighbourhood, burnt
                    their<br/> houses, took off many prisoners, and others they<br/> killed. Where
                    we breakfasted, the man of the house<br/> told us, his father and father-in-law
                    were both killed<br/> by them, on the same morning. Where we dined,<br/> the
                    woman's husband had been killed, in like man-<br/>ner. This day we passed
                    several old fortifications,<br/> block houses, &amp;c. which appeared a weak
                    defence:<br/>and breathing aspirations were raised, to become an <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_059" n="59"></pb> inhabitant of a city whose walls are salvation,
                    and<br/> whose light and glory the Lord of hosts is. We<br/> also passed several
                    places for worship. The whole<br/> journey of this day was about twenty-three
                    miles.<br/> The country very fertile, and capable of abundant<br/> improvement,
                    which may increase the useful trade<br/> of <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, keep
                    up the sound of<br/> the millstones near the <geogname key="nrive">North
                        river</geogname>, — largely occu-<br/>py the merchants of New York, — and
                    freight their<br/> ships with heavy burthens for distant climes.
                    Ve-<br/>getation appears nearly the same from day to day,<br/> as we proceed to
                    the north west, which is the gen-<br/>eral course of the river thus far.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-12">12th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Which was the first of the week, we set<br/>
                    out from Esq. Nellis's, which is about fifteen miles<br/> north of <geogname key="otseg">Otsego lake</geogname>, the head source of the north<br/> branch
                    of <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, and about fifty miles
                    north<br/> of the boat and raft navigation of the <geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>. Pro-<br/>ceeding up the river we found the water very
                    shoal;<br/> in many places not more than fifteen inches deep.<br/> The
                    navigation is exceedingly hurt by the river be-<br/>ing divided into many parts
                    by islands, some less,<br/> and some larger, from one to seventy acres in
                    size.<br/> We landed and tarried awhile at <a href="/places/famst">Fort
                        Hendricks<placename key="famst"></placename></a> on<br/> the south side of the river. Opposite, on the
                    north<br/> side, comes in, a large stream, called <geogname key="wcana">Canada
                        creek</geogname>,<br/> about the size of <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>. This place was the<br/> seat of an old Indian king.
                    We noticed many large<br/> old apple trees, said to have been planted by
                    the<br/> Indians.</p>
<p>This day, tho wind blew very brisk, and directly<br/>against us; which made our
                    progress slow, and the<br/> labour of the men exceeding hard. With
                    consider-<br/>able difficulty, we stemmed the current ten miles,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_060" n="60"></pb> to the falls of the river, which are
                    thirty-eight and<br/> a half feet in three quarters of a mile. It is a very<br/>
                    romantic spot. In one place, the water pitches down<br/> about seven feet. Here
                    is a fine grist mill, saw mill,<br/> and fulling mill. A Scotch gentleman, named
                        <a href="/people/jport1">John Porteous<persname key="jport1"></persname></a>, is the proprietor of
                    the seat. It will, some<br/> time, in all probability, become a great interest.
                    —<br/> Here are great preparations making to open a canal,<br/> which I think
                    they will complete, as nature has done<br/> abundance toward facilitating this
                    very important<br/> object. The river is contracted by rocks and hills<br/> to
                    one hundred feet wide, at the falls, and for some<br/> distance below. At this
                    place, a spacious wooden<br/> bridge is erected across the river. On the
                    north<br/> side, are evident marks of nature having, at some<br/> very remote
                    period of time, undergone a great re-<br/>volution. I think it appears to a
                    demonstration,<br/> that the river once ran among the rocks, that are<br/> now
                    thirty perches from the present bed of the wa-<br/>ter, and twenty feet above
                    its level. Rocks and<br/> stones are lying in a very irregular position, but
                    so<br/> smoothed, and worn into curves of many shapes,<br/> like ovens, large
                    kettles, and some worn down like<br/> a hollow gum, six or seven feet deep, and
                    bear every<br/> appearance of the rocks in the bed, and on the sides<br/> of the
                    river, at present. This afternoon, we enga-<br/>ged seven wagons to transport
                    our stores and boats,<br/> one mile across these falls. We were kindly
                    received<br/> by our friend <a href="/people/jport1">Porteous<persname key="jport1"></persname></a>, and the
                    superintendent of<br/> the canal, a very intelligent man, Major <a href="/people/fdeza1">Frederick Augustus De Zang<persname key="fdeza1"></persname></a>; where I drank tea,
                    and lodged.<br/> He emigrated from Saxony, and married <a href="/people/clawr1">Caleb Law-rence<persname key="clawr1"></persname></a>’s daughter, of New York. Though this
                    place<br/> is so rocky and wild, it is said a rattlesnake has not<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_061" n="61"></pb> been found at any time, north of
                        <geogname key="wcana">Canada creek</geogname>. On<br/> the east side of that
                    water, about seven miles distant,<br/> they abound to such a degree, that the
                    settlers there<br/> are obliged, in their own defence, to keep large<br/> herds
                    of swine, of three or four years old — and such<br/> is the sagacity of the
                    swine, that they will set their<br/> foot on the head of the reptile, and begin
                    at the tail<br/> to eat.</p>
<p>Below these falls, for three miles, the water is an<br/> amazing depth — perhaps
                    eighty feet deep. Here<br/> our setting poles were of no account, and our
                    oars<br/> and paddles were not sufficient to propel the boat<br/> against the
                    wind; so that at one time I did not know<br/> but we should here have made our
                    beds. But through<br/> the abounding mercy of Him “who holdeth the winds<br/> in
                    his fists, and measureth the waters in the hollow<br/> of his hand," we got
                    through to comfortable lodgings.<br/> The three precedingg nights we lay on our
                    mattresses,<br/> except the general, who was accommodated with a<br/> bed.</p></div>

<p>The wagons assembled about sunrise,
                    took<br/> our baggage and boats about one mile, to the still<br/> water above
                    the falls. We dined at our friend <a href="/people/jport1">Porteous<persname key="jport1"></persname></a>'s — embarked in the afternoon — passed the<br/>
                    wolf riffle and one other piece of strong water —<br/> about six miles, to the
                        <a href="/places/gefla">German Flats<placename key="gefla"></placename></a> — on the way,<br/> passed
                    several block houses, and one meeting house.<br/> Here we were but six miles
                    north of the head wa-<br/>ters of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>. But it felt to me, a land<br/> of darkness, and a
                    land of blood. Many of the peo-<br/>ple had had their relations killed and
                    scalped, whose<br/> spirits remain rough, and much exasperated against<br/> the
                    Indians.</p></div>

<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_062" n="62"></pb>
<p>Proceeded forward, and that evening
                    reach-<br/> ed <a href="/places/fschy">Fort Schuyler<placename key="fschy"></placename></a>, where is
                    erected a wooden bridge,<br/> whose arch is one hundred and twenty feet
                    wide,<br/> without any support from below. The butments<br/> are of framed
                    timber, without stone in any part of<br/>them. The sweep of the arch appeared to
                    be about<br/>seven feet. The land in this day's progress, was<br/> very rich;
                    and the whole face of the country, as far<br/> as I could see, was flat, and
                    abounding with very<br/> large sugar trees, elm, white walnut, beech, &amp;c.
                    —<br/> The water, in this day's journey, which was about<br/> twenty-three
                    miles, was a fine, deep, still run, great<br/> part of the way, without using
                    our oars. This coun-<br/>try settles rapidly. I was much perplexed for
                    miles,<br/> with the continued smoke from the fires on shore,<br/> where they
                    are clearing the lands, and manufacturing<br/> pot and pearl ash, and maple
                    sugar. The potash is<br/> a great article of trade, selling at from forty-five
                    to<br/> fifty pounds per ton. At New York, one merchant,<br/> I was told,
                    procured one thousand tons the last year.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-15">15th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>The morning clear, and the air cold.
                    Here<br/> the earth is very dry, having had but little rain for<br/> two months.
                    Several of our company took horse at<br/>
<a href="/places/white">Whitestown<placename key="white"></placename></a>, and rode to <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, at the head<br/> of the boat
                    navigation, on the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname>. The<br/> fort
                    stands on the highest ground between the wa-<br/>ters which run to the sea
                    southward, and those which<br/> run into the <geogname key="oneil">Oneida
                        lake</geogname>, and empty into the <geogname key="stlar">St.<br/> Lawrence
                        river</geogname>. Our journey this day by water,<br/> was twenty-four miles.
                    Those who rode by land,<br/> about sixteen miles. They passed the ground
                    where<br/> a battle had been fought with the Indians, in the last<br/> war; in
                    which many fell on both sides; but the In-<br/>dians kept the ground. The skulls
                    of divers remain<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_063" n="63"></pb> on the ground,
                    having the marks of the tomahawk<br/> and scalping knife evidently upon them.
                    One of our<br/> party brought a skull along with him. The land as<br/> we came
                    up the river, appears rich. The river about<br/> one hundred feet wide, and
                    exceedingly crooked,<br/> much resembling a worm fence — the reaches about<br/>
                    fifty perches long. The country very little settled.<br/> We dined in the woods,
                    on the bank of the stream.<br/> The timber very large, — sugar trees are here
                    in<br/> abundance — also buttonwood and white walnut of<br/> large size. Here,
                    and for thirty miles below, hills<br/> and mountains quite disappear. The land
                    on the<br/> dividing ridge, stony and thin, much covered with<br/> pitch pine.
                    But when the earth shall disclose her<br/> blood, and no more cover her slain, a
                    tremendous<br/> account must be settled, for the blood shed on the<br/> banks of
                    the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname>. One skeleton, and a gun by<br/> his
                    side, is said to have been harrowed up a few<br/> days past — the remains of a
                    beaver hat, decayed<br/> stockings, &amp;c.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-16">16th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>It took up this day to get the boats and
                    bag-<br/>gage across the carrying place, one mile, to <geogname key="woodc">Wood<br/>creek</geogname>, a small stream about ten yards wide, and
                    very<br/> shoal. Five of our company, on the morning of the<br/>
<date when="1793-05-17">17th</date>, took wagon, and proceeded down <geogname key="woodc">Wood creek</geogname><br/> by land. But such a ride I never had
                    before. Pole<br/> bridges, slotches of mud and water, and short nob<br/> hills,
                    sometimes one side, then another, like to over-<br/>set; and the wagon very
                    shackling, made the tour<br/> very disagreeable. However, in about three
                    hours,<br/> we arrived at <a href="/people/crann1">Captain Ranney<persname key="crann1"></persname></a>'s, at
                    the junction of<br/>
<geogname key="wcana">Canada creek</geogname>. The whole of the eight miles,
                    a<br/> dreary hemlock and beech wilderness, without in-<br/>habitant that I saw,
                    except musquetoes in thousands.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_064" n="64"></pb> It appears well adapted for their
                    existence. At the<br/> mouth of <geogname key="wcana">Canada creek</geogname> we
                    re-embarked, and pro-<br/>ceeded down <geogname key="woodc">Wood
                        creek</geogname> eight miles to the <a href="/places/oakor">Oak
                        Orchard<placename key="oakor"></placename></a>, where <a href="/people/jamhe1">General
                    Amhurst<persname key="jamhe1"></persname></a>’s army encamped<br/> on his way to the Canada expedition, in
                    the French<br/> war. Here our little camp pitched their tents. I<br/> rested
                    well on the bank of <geogname key="woodc">Wood creek</geogname>.</p>
<p>Struck our tents early in the morning of the <date when="1793-05-18">18th</date>,<br/> and proceeded down the stream about six miles;<br/> then
                    kindled up a fire on the bank, and cooked a<br/> breakfast of tea and chocolate.
                    The land continues<br/> low, level, and rich, abounding with sugar trees
                    and<br/> white walnut. The navigation of the creek is abun-<br/>dantly
                    obstructed by vast quantities of timber. —<br/> Here the stream is about fifty
                    feet wide. These<br/> waters abound with fish, of which we caught some,<br/>
                    with a gig, from the bow of our boat, and some<br/> trout, with hook and line.
                    About noon, we dined<br/> at the Big Bend, four miles from the lake, on the<br/>
                    bank of the creek, not having seen a cabin for twen-<br/>ty- five miles. The
                    banks abound with lofty timber,<br/> sugar trees, elm, some large oaks, and
                    shellbark<br/> hickory, in which the pigeons innumerable build<br/> their nests.
                    Here and there a small fox squirrel ap-<br/>pears, — a few robins, blackbirds,
                    and jays. About<br/> three o'clock we came to the entrance of <geogname key="oneil">Oneida<br/> lake</geogname>, which, though among the number of
                    inferior<br/> lakes, makes an awful appearance, and is doubtless<br/> a
                    wonderful display of that infinite Wisdom and<br/> Power by which the worlds
                    were made. Our course<br/> along this little ocean appeared to be a little
                    north<br/> of west; and the wind being brisk from that point,<br/> we raised our
                    tents, as no habitation appeared. </p>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_065" n="65"></pb>
<p>This evening, a number of Indians came to our<br/> camp, viz. <a href="/people/clewi2">Col. Lewis<persname key="clewi2"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt.
                        John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a>, and a very old<br/> chief, named <a href="/people/poney1">Beechtree<persname key="poney1"></persname></a>, or King Doe, and several<br/> young warriors, painted
                    red, with black streaks. —<br/> Some had their ears cut in strings, with
                    trinkets in<br/> them; and they mostly had bobs of wampum, metal,<br/> or bright
                    shells, hung in their noses. They had<br/> two of their wives with them— each
                    had a child<br/> laced with its back to a board — the front side made<br/> of
                    skins, lined with soft flannel, and a canopy of<br/> curious work like
                    embroidery, overhead — of like<br/> workmanship, were the laces and bandages
                    with<br/> which the infant was fastened in — these they loose<br/> with great
                    facility, and take out the babe. The<br/> whole has the appearance of a case,
                    narrow at bot-<br/>tom, and widens upwards — it is about two feet in<br/>
                    length, and has a bow to the front side of it, to go<br/> over the mother's
                    breast, when she carries the child.<br/> There were about eleven Indians in this company;<br/>
<a href="/people/skirk1">Kirkland<persname key="skirk1"></persname></a>, their missionary, was with them, and
                    in-<br/>terpreted for us. The old chief said he heard we<br/> were there, and
                    with trembling knees, leaning on<br/> his staff, he had come to see us; as we
                    were on the<br/> work of peace, he rejoiced to see us on that errand,<br/> and
                    hoped the Great Spirit would bless our endea-<br/>vours, with which he united,
                    and did not know<br/> what he lived for, except it was to see it. <a href="/people/cjohn1">Captain John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a> spoke to like import, and said he
                    was glad<br/> some of the sons of Onas were along. We imparted<br/> some small
                    tokens of respect to the women and chil-<br/>dren, who after a visit of about
                    two hours, went<br/> away, with some of the young men. The old ones<br/> staid
                    and supped with us on the bank of the lake,<br/> and then departed.</p>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_066" n="66"></pb>
<p>About eight in the evening, the wind lulled, we<br/> struck our tents, and
                    hurried on board. The lake<br/>was smooth, and the moon shining. We went
                    with<br/> our oars, beautifully, about twelve miles. Suddenly<br/> there
                    appeared a cloud rising in the south-west,<br/> which soon spread, and obscured
                    the light of the<br/> moon. It began to rain, with a heavy gale of wind,<br/>
                    and the scene was soon changed, from serenity and<br/> calmness, into a foaming
                    tempest. Our little fleet<br/> got scattered — the swells became so great as to
                    ren-<br/>der oars useless. The water being shoal, and the<br/> shore rocky, we
                    durst not attempt to run in. Our<br/> boatmen proposed to raise the mast, and
                    hoist sail;<br/>which, with great difficulty, from the beating of the<br/>
                    waves, and the extreme darkness, was effected. —<br/>After which, our little
                    bark ran violently before the<br/>wind, rocking over the swells like a tub on
                    the wa-<br/>ter. But through the providence of Almighty pow-<br/>er, about break
                    of day, we got into the mouth of the<br/>
<geogname key="oneir">Oneida river</geogname>, though several of our boats did
                    not<br/> arrive for some hours after. This lake is about thir-<br/>ty miles
                    long, and eight wide. In crossing which,<br/> I underwent a close and searching
                    baptism, not only<br/> respecting the present embassy, but all the actions<br/>
                    of my life: for eternity appeared very near.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-19">19th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Being first day, we resumed our
                    navigation<br/> down the <geogname key="oneir">Oneida river</geogname> about
                    eighteen miles, to the<br/> junction of the <geogname key="sener">Seneca</geogname> or <geogname key="onori">Onondago river</geogname>. It
                    is<br/> about as large as the <geogname key="oneir">Oneida</geogname>; each
                    perhaps three hun-<br/>dred feet wide. At this place we met three families<br/>
                    of new settlers, who were glad to see us, as were<br/> we to see them. Here also
                    we met several Indians,<br/> mostly young men and women, marvellously
                    trim-<br/>med with cut ears, ear-rings and nose jewels. --<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_067" n="67"></pb> Amongst them, was a young warrior, grimly
                    paint-<br/>ed; even his hair painted and plaited, and stood out<br/> on each
                    side in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Here we had conversation with a man who lives<br/> at the Salt Springs on the
                        <geogname key="cayug">Cayuga Lake</geogname>, which is<br/> about ten miles
                    long and seven broad. He related<br/> that when wood was provided, and two
                    kettles set,<br/> of sixty gallons each, he could make five bushels<br/> per
                    day; that the fountain appeared inexhaustible;<br/> that excellent fresh water
                    springs were found within<br/>twelve yards of the salt; and that eighteen miles
                    land<br/>carriage would take it to the <geogname key="chemu">Chemung
                        river</geogname>, a branch<br/> of the west fork of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>.</p>
<p>We resumed our voyage — passed about a mile of<br/>rapid water — and afterwards
                    eleven miles of still<br/> water, to <geogname key="oswef">Oswego
                        Falls</geogname>. Here the river is about<br/> two hundred yards wide, and
                    the water at one pitch<br/> all across the river, falls eight feet, and forms
                    a<br/> strong, foaming rapid for one mile below. The<br/> banks of this river
                    are low, and subject to be over-<br/>flowed. The land apparently rich.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-20">20th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Drew our boats across the carrying
                    place,<br/> about sixty yards, launched in below, and proceed-<br/>ed to
                        <a href="/places/oswft">Oswego garrison<placename key="oswft"></placename></a>, held by the British.
                    They<br/>expecting us, we were admitted, and dined with the<br/> commanding
                    officer, <a href="/people/cwick1">Capt. Wickham<persname key="cwick1"></persname></a>. After dinner,<br/> we
                    pursued our journey on the <geogname key="lakeo">sea of Ontario</geogname>,
                    fifteen<br/> miles to a harbor called <a href="/places/lsodu">Little
                        Sodus<placename key="lsodu"></placename></a>. Grand indeed<br/> is the prospect of this great lake.
                    About the middle<br/> there is no view of land northward, eastward or<br/>
                    westward in the clearest day.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-21">21st</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>We sailed and rowed, passed the mouth of<br/>
<geogname key="sodus">Great Sodus</geogname>, to Apple Boom harbour,
                    twenty-seven<br/> miles from <a href="/places/lsodu">Little Sodus<placename key="lsodu"></placename></a>.
                    This day was exceeding<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_068" n="68"></pb> warm on the lake, and the journey very
                    lonesome.<br/> Day after day not a face to be seen, but our own<br/> company.
                    The water of the lake is clear and cold;<br/> much more so than the rivers which
                    empty into it.<br/> Our navigation is along the southern margin of <geogname key="lakeo">On-<br/>tario</geogname>. The land appears well timbered and
                    habita-<br/>ble; but I could perceive no springs, or small rivu-<br/>lets
                    emptying into the lake. The shore is composed<br/> of high banks for miles
                    together; then low vallies in<br/> succession, which form bays and harbors for
                    the<br/> boatmen in case of sudden storms of wind, which<br/> are very frequent,
                    and make a surprising commotion<br/> in the waters. In these storms many
                    adventurers,<br/> after enduring amazing difficulties, have perished;<br/> and
                    others have marvellously escaped. We did not<br/>venture more than one mile from
                    shore. The water<br/> is from three to ten feet deep — the bottom,
                    appear-<br/>ed as if paved with close jointed flag stones of seven,<br/> ten, or
                    twenty feet square — or like a street paved<br/> with round smooth stones.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-22">22nd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>The wind was high and the water rough.<br/>
                    We lay in the harbor till four in the afternoon,<br/> when we journeyed forward,
                    rowing about eight<br/> miles, and after sundown, made the shore. Where<br/>
                    also a boat from <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a> came with several
                    passen-<br/>gers on board — a clergyman, <a href="/people/tspea1">Townsend
                        Speakman<persname key="tspea1"></persname></a>'s<br/> brother's six orphan children, and a <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> In-<br/>dian man,
                    who could speak some English; he seem-<br/>ed pleased with the prospect of
                    peace; and said, he<br/>was at no time for war.</p></div>

<p>Set out a little after daylight. The
                    wind<br/> being against us, about eight o'clock we put in to<br/> shore a little
                    eastward of the mouth of <geogname key="genes2">Genessee<br/> river</geogname>;
                    struck up fires and breakfasted; then passed<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_069" n="69"></pb> on -- and arrived at the <a href="/places/oakor">White Oak Orchard harbor<placename key="oakor"></placename></a><br/> about dark. Here we
                    encamped amongst a number<br/> of Indian graves. Here also came a boat, with
                    two<br/> families, removing from <a href="/places/genes">Genessee<placename key="genes"></placename></a> to
                    Upper Canada,<br/> on account of the sickly situation of the <a href="/places/genec">Genessee country<placename key="genec"></placename></a>. In this day's journey the
                    margin of the<br/> lake appeared very low, the timber small and shrub-<br/>by,
                    abundance of bays, and swampy ground. Bra-<br/>doe's bay is the most beautiful
                    of any I saw on the<br/> sides of the lake.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-24">24th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>The air sharp and cold, we stood up the
                    lake<br/> with a fair, gentle breeze, which gradually increased,<br/> and
                    carried us with velocity past Golden Hill, Cag<br/> Inlet, &amp;c. over many a
                    foaming wave, which at<br/> length ran so high, that the boats began to ship
                    wa-<br/>ter, and we put into eighteen mile creek harbor.<br/> Here I walked out,
                    and met with what appeared to<br/> me to be a piece of antiquity. A mound fifty
                    yards<br/> in circumference, raised to more than six feet high.<br/> On the
                    elevation about two feet above the base, is a<br/> white oak tree, of two feet
                    diameter, which I sup-<br/>pose has originated since the formation of this
                    artifi-<br/>cial mount. But the design remains matter of con-<br/>jecture.
                    Perhaps some kind of fortification, or to<br/> commemorate some great
                    achievement, or more pro-<br/>bable the sepulchre of ancient kings.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-25">25th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>We struck our tents, and journeyed on
                    eigh-<br/>teen miles to the garrison of <a href="/places/fniag">Niagara<placename key="fniag"></placename></a>, a strong for-<br/>tification, but a dark, noisy,
                    confused, dirty place.<br/> We ferried over the river to <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>, in the do-<br/>minions of the king of Great
                    Britain.</p></div>

<p>and first of the week, we visited governor<br/>
<a href="/people/gsim">Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>, who received, us in a friendly manner.
                    It<br/> was now confirmed to us, that the Indians would <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_070" n="70"></pb> not assemble before the <date when="1793-07-01">1st of 7th mo.</date>. It proved<br/> a close trial, to be so long
                    separated from the dear-<br/>est connexions in life, and driven into the
                    sickly<br/> season of the year, so that I found a necessity for<br/> the
                    exercise of faith and patience. My mind was<br/> turned to the Lord for counsel,
                    in this proving sea-<br/>son. Several things revolved in my mind — whe-<br/>ther
                    to to return home, or to try to seek out some of<br/> the scattered sheep, in
                    Canada.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-27">27th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p><a href="/people/gsim">Governor
                        Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a> came to see us at our<br/> lodgings. He conversed with
                    freedom and candour,<br/> on the subject of the treaty, — holding the posts of<br/>
<a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/osweg2">Oswego<placename key="osweg2"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, &amp;c. As
                    also respecting<br/> certain laws which he wished to take place in the
                    <br/>province, where Friends might be exempted from<br/> military requisitions.
                    To which we replied accord-<br/>ing to the understanding given. He is a plain
                    man,<br/> and much beloved in the government.</p>
<p>After breakfast, we moved out of our lodge in<br/>
<a href="/places/newar">Newark<placename key="newar"></placename></a>, embarked on board the boats, and with
                    a<br/> fair wind stood up the river eight miles to a landing<br/> below the
                    great falls, where is a carrying place of<br/> eleven miles to <geogname key="chipp">Chipaway creek</geogname>, three miles above<br/> the falls. The
                    river or outlet of <geogname key="lakee">lake Erie</geogname>, is about<br/>
                    half a mile wide to this place; where it is contract-<br/>ed to half that width.
                    The bank from <geogname key="niaga">Niagara</geogname> up<br/>here, is about
                    forty feet high, and very steep to this<br/> place, where the elevation is
                    greatly increased. On<br/> our way, we were hailed from the bank by our
                    be-<br/>loved friends, <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jelli1">John
                        Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>, whom we were glad to see. They returned<br/> to the
                    landing, and we all dined together at Captain<br/> Smith's quarters, in the mess
                    house, with five or six<br/> of the officers of the regiment of Queen’s rangers.
                        <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_071" n="71"></pb> There being no house where we
                    could lodge, we<br/> pitched our tents in a lot of one Phelps.</p></div>

<p><a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a> and myself went four miles<br/> to see <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>'s family. They related the<br/>
                    dreadful circumstances they were reduced to, in this<br/> country, by scarcity
                    of bread, and provisions of all<br/> kinds, in the year <date when="1789">1789</date> — when they came to an al-<br/>lowance of one spoonful of meal
                    per day, for one<br/> person — eat strawberry leaves, beech leaves,
                    flax-<br/>seed dried, and ground in a coffee mill — catched the<br/> blood of a
                    little pig — bled the almost famished cow <br/>and oxen — walked twelve miles
                    for one shive of<br/> bread, paid twelve shillings for twelve pounds of<br/>
                    meal. One of the lads, who was hired out, carried<br/> his little sister two
                    miles on his back, to let her eat<br/> his breakfast, and they gave him none
                    till dinner.<br/> The children leaped for joy, at one robin being<br/> caught,
                    out of which a whole pot of broth was made.<br/> They eat mustard, potatoe tops,
                    sassafras root, and<br/> made tea of the tops. The relation was deeply
                    af-<br/>fecting. The case being general, one could not help<br/> another. Which
                    brought to my mind, the many<br/> thankless meals, enjoyed in the land of
                    plenty.</p>
<p>This place is situated within four miles of the<br/>
<geogname key="niagf">grand falls</geogname>; the noise of which, resembles the
                    roar-<br/>ing of the waves of the ocean, in the time of a storm.<br/> One Indian
                    and a white man, have been carried down<br/> this amazing cataract, within two
                    years. The white <br/>man tumbled out of his canoe just at the beginning<br/> of
                    the rapids, and was hurled down.<br/> The poor In-<br/>dian was asleep, in his
                    canoe, which was tied to the<br/> bank; it is supposed some wicked person loosed
                    it,<br/> and it glided down into the rapids, when some per-<br/>son hollowed to
                    him; on which he stood up, struck <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_072" n="72"></pb> a
                    few strokes with his paddle to no effect, then <br/>wrapped his head in his
                    blanket, and laid down in<br/> his canoe, to meet his horrid destiny. He was
                    found<br/> two miles below; but none of his bones were broken.</p>
<p>Here I saw the skin of a porcupine, an animal<br/> about as large as a well grown
                    ground hog, with a<br/> bushy tail, and claws like that animal. His body <br/>
                    interspersed with a vast number of stiff, pointed<br/> quills; which are its
                    defence when attacked. Here<br/> is a beautiful odoriferous little tree, called
                    the Balm<br/> of Gilead. It resembles the lombardy poplar. Here<br/> also, the
                    juniper abounds. They are natives of this<br/> latitude. Gooseberries and
                    currants of divers colours<br/> and kinds, are found here.</p>
<p> My route in all, thus far, seven hundred and<br/> twenty-one miles.</p></div>

<p>A wet day—which is a blessing to the
                    earth<br/> and its inhabitants hereaway, as it has been exceed-<br/>ing dry.</p>
<p><date when="1793-05-30">30th</date>. <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph

                    myself,<br/> went about two and a half miles, to visit that phe-<br/>nomenon in
                    nature — the great <geogname key="niagf">Falls of Niagara</geogname>,<br/> whose
                    thunders, for several days, had with awful-<br/>ness reached mine ears. When I
                    approached this<br/> tremendous cataract, it truly appeared amazing, and<br/>
                    with the voice of thunder, proclaimed the majesty<br/> of its sublime Architect.
                    When we came to the mar-<br/>gin of the river below the falls,<br/> we descended
                    the<br/> almost perpendicular bank, by several windings,<br/> from one rock to
                    another, and with the aid of seve-<br/>ral Indian ladders, at length reached the
                    surface of<br/>the water, I suppose at least one hundred and fifty<br/>feet
                    below the summit. The irregular position of<br/> multitudes of huge rocks, which
                    no doubt had tum-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_073" n="73"></pb>bled from their ancient seats, made our
                    progress up<br/> toward the pitch, rough and difficult. We found<br/>logs,
                    pieces of canoes, &amp;c. in abundance, twelve or<br/> fifteen feet above the
                    present level of the water —<br/> also ducks, loons, cormorants, catfish,
                    pickerels, and<br/> various kinds of fish and water fowl, which had<br/> been
                    killed by the dashing of the columns of water,<br/> tumbling off a precipice not
                    less than one hundred and<br/> twenty feet perpendicular. The rocks and stones
                    are<br/> mostly excellent limestone, as are the stones in the<br/> banks for six
                    or seven miles below, where, from<br/> every appearance, I think it is not
                    absurd to sup-<br/>pose the falls once were, but have worn up to the<br/>
                    present barrier, where the river makes a bend, and<br/> the water is divided by
                    an island; though two thirds<br/> of it, or more, pass on the north side of the
                    island. I<br/> think it is not improbable that the lands adjoining,<br/>derive
                    considerable advantage to vegetation, from<br/> the misty vapors which arise,
                    and are exhaled to<br/> the clouds, or blown by the varying winds, on the<br/>
                    neighboring farms. Some of these are exceeding<br/> fertile; abounding with
                    grass and grain. After spend-<br/>ing an hour or two, almost lost in admiration,
                    we<br/> ascended by the way we went down, and rode eight<br/> miles to the
                    landing, where we dined at <a href="/people/bcanb1">Benjamin

<p>Here we were within the sound of the martial<br/> trumpet, where I did adopt the

<p>and first of the week. A
                    meet-<br/>ing being appointed about five miles distant, I set<br/> out on foot
                    to attend it. On the way, in the woods,<br/> I looked back and at a few perches
                    distance, were<br/> two Indians coming after me, on a trot — one of them<br/>
                    frightfully painted from below one eye to the mid-<br/>dle of his forehead, with
                    a vermillion red; the other<br/> side, jet black. His cheek and chin under the
                    black,<br/> was painted red, and the other side, under the red,<br/> was painted
                    black. He had a tail of hair, and skins<br/> of beasts, and birds with the
                    feathers on, which hung<br/> down below the calves of his legs, and blew out
                    be-<br/>hind him. He had his scalping knife in his hand.<br/> His stature was
                    middle sized; but his visage was ex-<br/>ceeding fierce and grim. I was quite
                    alone. I turned<br/> sideways, and stood till he came up, I believe
                    with-<br/>out visible emotion of fear, and accosted him thus:<br/> Which way in
                    such a hurry? He said, Hooch king,<br/>
<geogname key="buffc1">Buffaloe creek</geogname>! and passed along. I went on to the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_075" n="75"></pb> meeting, where my companions and divers
                    Friends,<br/> and other settlers in this new country, came, to the<br/> number
                    of about one hundred. The meeting was<br/> solid and satisfactory. We went to
                        <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>'s<br/> to dine, had a solid
                    opportunity in his family, and<br/> went to our kind friend <a href="/people/wlund1">William Lundy<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>'s, to lodge.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-03">3rd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Walked to <a href="/people/sbirc1">Squire
                        Birch<persname key="sbirc1"></persname></a>'s mills, on the ra-<br/>pids, above the unspeakably amazing
                    cataract; where<br/> I had a second view of this standing awful monu-<br/>ment
                    of the mighty power of Him, who created the<br/> heavens and the earth, the seas
                    and fountains of wa-<br/>ter. The rapids above, are about one mile square.<br/>
                    Pleasingly grand is the prospect — the waves dash-<br/>ing, and tumbling from
                    rock to rock, and altering<br/> their appearance every moment. Here also are
                    seen<br/> the misty vapours from the <geogname key="niagf">great
                        falls</geogname>, rising in curl-<br/>ing columns to the clouds, resembling
                    the smoke of<br/> numerous furnaces. Such are the friction of the
                    par-<br/>ticles of water descending, and the inconceivable<br/> weight of the
                    mass of water, dashing on the rocks<br/> below, that it more resembles smoke
                    than mist. —<br/> Our kind friend <a href="/people/sbirc1">Birch<persname key="sbirc1"></persname></a> has,
                    perhaps one of the grand-<br/>est situations for water works in the world; and
                    I<br/> think, if he opens his front door, he need never pay<br/> the clergy for
                    preaching. He is kind to Friends,<br/> having in early life, contracted an

                    where we paid a shilling<br/> for a floor to spread our mattresses on, and
                    other<br/> things equivalent</p></div>

<p>Went on board one of our boats, and
                    rowed<br/> eighteen miles to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, in
                    sight of the lake.<br/> — Here is a store house, garrison, &amp;c. The water from<br/>
<geogname key="chipp">Chipaway</geogname> to this place, is smooth, and a good
                    run<br/> for boats. Here lay three schooners, waiting a fair<br/> wind, bound
                    for Detroit. We went on board the<br/> Dunmore that evening.</p>
<p>Next morning, near sixty Indians came on board,<br/> on their way to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>; among whom were <a href="/people/haupa1">Capt. Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt.

<p>Quite becalmed. I felt renewed occasion
                    for<br/> the exercise of faith and patience. Expenses of<br/> boarding alone,
                    twelve shillings per day.</p>
<p>The waters of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> are three hundred
                    feet<br/> higher than those of <geogname key="lakeo">Ontario</geogname>,
                    thirty-seven miles be-<br/>low, and are restrained from deluging the
                    country<br/> by the same power which bounds "the sea by a per-<br/>petual
                    decree." Opposite this place, on the side of<br/> the United States, comes in
                        <geogname key="buffc1">Buffaloe creek</geogname>, where<br/> a council of
                    several Indian nations was held a few<br/> days past, preparatory to the general
                    treaty.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a gentle breeze sprung up, we<br/> hoisted sail, and stood out
                    into the lake. Passed<br/>
<a href="/places/point">Point Ebono<placename key="point"></placename></a>, the <geogname key="suga">Sugar

<p>Ran all last night under a brisk quarter
                    wind.<br/> This morning several of our passengers were very<br/> sick. I felt a
                    little dizzy; but toward noon it subsi-<br/>ed. This lake is, in general, about
                    fourteen fa-<br/>thoms water. As we navigated the middle, from<br/> whence we
                    could only just discern the opposite<br/> shores, we could make no observations
                    respecting<br/> the soil.</p></div>

                    this morning,<br/> over the waters of this formidable ocean, which has<br/> a

<p>A gentle breeze from south west, made
                    our<br/> progress toward <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> tedious, yet
                    afforded time<br/> for conversation and contemplation. There being<br/>
                    representatives of five different Indian nations on<br/> board; some French,
                    British, German, Scotch, and<br/> American United States men; some soldiers,
                    sailors,<br/> merchants, mechanics, and farmers. Yet, notwith-<br/>standing all
                    the variety of prospects and interests,<br/> a perfect harmony and decorum were
                    observed. In<br/> the observation of which, my faith and hope were a<br/> little

<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-09">9th of 6th month</date>, <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>and first of the week. Last<br/>
                    night was a solemn, awful season. The preceding<br/> day was very warm. The
                    thermometer at eighty.<br/> A little before sunset, the wind lulled into a
                    per-<br/>fect calm. A dark cloud arose south westward, and<br/> slowly
                    approached us. About midnight it came on,<br/> with terrible wind, thunder and
                    lightning,—to a<br/> humbling degree to me and the rest, more especially,<br/>
                    as we had fifty barrels of gunpowder on board, and<br/> between eighty and
                    ninety passengers, divers of<br/> whom had been fierce warriors, both Indians
                    and <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_078" n="78"></pb> white men. Under every
                    consideration, I felt my<br/> own righteousness as filthy rags, and dare not
                    indulge<br/> a secret thought that it would be unjust if the schoo-<br/>ner
                    should be blown up. I had no where to rest my<br/> confidence, save in the
                    unspeakable mercy of Israel's<br/> mighty God, by whose power we were
                    preserved.<br/> The noise, and exertions of the seamen, were great.<br/> Their
                    care and activity was as commendable, as it<br/>was admirable. My spirit visited
                    my habitation, to<br/> take a solemn leave of my dear companion, and
                    ten-<br/>derly beloved children. I felt the peace it would<br/> be, to yield up
                    life at home. I remembered, I had<br/> been baptized into death, and brought
                    under great<br/> awfulness, even unto tears and trembling, before I<br/> set out
                    on this journey: and upon the whole, I was<br/> favoured with a good degree of
                    quietness and resig-<br/>nation. We now approached near the islands at the<br/>
                    west end of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>. Our captain lowered
                    sail,<br/> and stood eastward till morning, then put about and<br/> passed the
                    first island about noon. The wind very<br/> unstable, frequent squalls succeeded
                    by little breezes<br/> and calms. In the afternoon, came in sight of nine<br/>
                    smaller, and some larger beautiful islands. This<br/> day we had a solid,
                    religious opportunity on board.<br/>
<a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt. John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/haupa1">Capt.
                        Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>, and other Indians and<br/> passengers, present — I
                    believe to good satisfaction.<br/> The two Indian chiefs dined with us.</p></div>

<p>A fair wind — stemmed the heavy current<br/>
                    eighteen miles up <geogname key="detror">Detroit river</geogname> to the
                    garrison. Ma-<br/>ny plantations are on both sides of the river, mostly<br/>
                    occupied by French people. On our arrival, I went<br/> with three other Friends,
                    to the citadel, to produce<br/> our passport from <a href="/people/gsim">Governor
                        Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a> to the com-<br/>manding officer, <a href="/people/cengl1">Colonel England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, a cheerful, open <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_079" n="79"></pb> countenanced, masculine soldier, who received
                    us<br/> like a gentleman, and kindly offered civilities to<br/> us, — for which
                    we acknowledged obligations to<br/> him.</p>
<p> Here are fine banks, well improved. The oldest<br/> orchards appear luxuriant —
                    apples, peaches, pears,<br/> cherries, &amp;c. But no springs of water, nor
                    streams<br/> with falls: being obliged to have recourse to wind-<br/>mills to
                    manufacture their grain. Of these mills<br/> they have a number in sight. The
                    inhabitants are a<br/> mixture of French, German, English, Irish, Scotch,<br/>
                    Yankees, Indians and Negroes.</p></div>

<p>Held a conference with <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt. John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a> and se-<br/>veral other Indian chiefs and
                    principal men; in<br/> which our peaceable mission was more fully
                    explain-<br/>ed, than heretofore. Notwithstanding our disinter-<br/>ested, and
                    universal principles of love and good will<br/> to mankind, we are sensible our
                    path is narrow, and<br/> our situation delicate--the eyes of four different
                    in-<br/>terests being open towards us;— British, United<br/> States, Indians,
                    and the reputation of our religious<br/>society.</p>
<p>This afternoon, walked three miles down the west<br/>side of <geogname key="detror">Detroit river</geogname>, to a spring, at which I was
                    re-<br/>freshed, not having drank any other than river wa-<br/>ter for ten days.
                    On our route to the spring, we<br/> called at a French house, to keep out of a
                    gust of<br/> rain. The family appeared polite, loving, and pleased<br/> to see
                    us. On our return, we called to see an old<br/> noted Indian trader, <a href="/people/iwill2">Isaac Williams<persname key="iwill2"></persname></a>, who is well ac-<br/>quainted with
                    the Indian affairs, and their disposi-<br/>tions. He related many alarming
                    circumstances of<br/> Indian cruelty; and said they were at present more<br/>
                    haughty and insolent, than heretofore. He rehear-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_080" n="80"></pb> sed an
                    instance of a riot which happened that day<br/>week, with a violent party of
                    Indians: in which he<br/>interfered, to prevent murder, but he got
                    wounded<br/>in the arm, with a scalping knife. He insinuated<br/>doubts of our
                    ever returning from <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, unless<br/>the
                    commissioners submitted to the Indian demands,<br/> which were very high. These
                    were also the senti-<br/>ments of divers persons acquainted with Indians, in
                    <br/>this place. All which conspired to our deep humi-<br/>liation, and
                    dependance on the Omnipotent Arm,<br/> having none other to lean to.</p>
<p>We frequently meet Indians here, where they get<br/>too much strong drink; in
                    which state they discover<br/>a very alarming, and disagreeable ferocity.
                    Here,<br/> are divers persons who have been prisoners amongst<br/> them, some of
                    whom recite shocking accounts of<br/>their cruelty, in many instances; others
                    speak more<br/> favourably of their treatment. However, upon the<br/> whole,
                    under all the circumstances of the approach-<br/>ing treaty, it evidently
                    appears a serious business; and<br/> little, if any thing, short of offering up
                    life, by those<br/>who attend it. We have hitherto found very few of<br/> the
                    natives, who have any knowledge of Friends, or<br/>their principles.</p>
<p>This evening we met <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, and a
                    number<br/> of the officers, on the bank of the river; with whom<br/>we had
                    considerable conversation; in which, I hope,<br/>we acknowledged, and supported
                    the peaceable prin-<br/>ciples of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour
                    Jesus<br/>Christ. They treated us on every occasion, like<br/>gentlemen, in
                    their way, — polite, and courteous to<br/>strangers, at least to us. <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a> told us, he<br/>had with much pains,
                    and expense, procured more<br/>than fifty prisoners from the Indians, clothed
                    them,<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_081" n="81"></pb> and forwarded them homeward; many of whom
                    dis-<br/>covered little sense of gratitude for the kindness;<br/> yet he felt a
                    reward, as being the friend of humanity.<br/> At night, returned to <a href="/people/mdols">Matthew Dobson<persname key="mdols"></persname></a>'s, where we<br/> have taken
                    lodgings.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-12">12th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had a solid conference with <a href="/people/dkenn1">David Kenne-dy<persname key="dkenn1"></persname></a>, a half Indian, a man of
                    learning, and a man of<br/>influence; having been educated in Scotland, he
                    visit-<br/>ed London, Jamaica, &amp;c. He lives with the Indians,<br/> and
                    professes christianity; is well versed in the Scrip-<br/>tures, and says he has
                    initiated divers into the Chris-<br/>tian faith, by a medium widely contrasted
                    with our<br/> mode. He told us, some Indians used to mock and<br/> ridicule his
                    going to church; but at a certain time,<br/> he undertook to drub them severely,
                    and ordered<br/> them and their families to attend church in future,<br/> or he
                    would be under the necessity of dealing more<br/> sharply with them. On which,
                    they appeared the<br/> next day of public worship, and had continued
                    stea-<br/>dy ever since; he supposed it the most substantial<br/> method of
                    making converts, as also of ending quar-<br/>rels or disputes. To all which I
                    opposed several<br/> texts out of the New Testament; to the validity of
                    <br/>which he assented, and strongly avowed his friend-<br/>ship for us, and
                    promised to use his influence, in or-<br/>der to open our way amongst the other
                    nations of<br/> his acquaintance, which is extensive.</p>
<p> We had to dine with us, a religious Dunker and his<br/> wife, settlers hereaway,
                    with whom we had fellow-<br/>ship. They felt near to us; which I believe was
                    re-<br/>ciprocal. In the afternoon, we had a visit from <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt. John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/ypete1">Young Peter<persname key="ypete1"></persname></a>, and
                    another Indian; to whom<br/>we read Friends' address, with which they
                    express-<br/>ed satisfaction, renewed their professions of friend-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_082" n="82"></pb>ship, and wanted a copy of our epistle,
                    which we<br/> waived, until the general assemblage at the great<br/> Council. In
                    the evening, had a visit from two re-<br/>spectable, intelligent British
                    officers, who behaved<br/> with politeness and civility.</p></div>

<p>Had an interview with <a href="/people/celli1">Capt. Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, deputy<br/> under <a href="/people/amcke1">Col.
                        McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>, the British superintendent of In-<br/>dian affairs, who
                    has been, for several weeks, enga-<br/>ged with numerous tribes of Indians, in
                    their coun-<br/>cils at the rapids of <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>,
                    preparatory to the great<br/> Council. <a href="/people/celli1">Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>
                    has great influence with the mid-<br/>dle hostile nations of Indians, and being
                    an intelli-<br/>gent person, and I thought, well disposed, might be<br/>
                    extensively useful in promoting the desirable work<br/> of general peace. We
                    suggested to him, as the sup-<br/>plies for the treaty came through his hands,
                    to guard<br/> against spirituous liquors being furnished. To the<br/> propriety
                    of which, as well as to divers other re-<br/>marks, he assented. We received an
                    invitation to dine<br/> with the British officers at the mess house
                    to-morrow.<br/> Through the variety of company and visiters, my<br/> mind is
                    preserved in a quiet, humble hope, that the<br/> Lord is preparing our way.</p>
<p>Here I met with a Quebec Calendar, wherein was<br/> inserted the names,
                    situation, and supposed number,<br/> of such Indian nations as have hitherto
                    been disco-<br/>vered in North America — being as follows:</p>

                        <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawa Indians<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>,
                    just <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_086" n="86"></pb> arrived from <a href="/places/michi">Michilimackinack<placename key="michi"></placename></a>, about three hun-<br/>dred miles
                    north west of this post, near the west<br/> end of <geogname key="lakeh">Lake
                        Huron</geogname>. To which place vessels can<br/> sail from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, without interruption of carry-<br/>ing
                    place or falls. These remote Indians were dress-<br/>ed, and painted with black,
                    red, green, and blue;<br/> having turbans round their heads, with pikes and<br/>
                    prongs of skins, feathers, hair, sticks, &amp;c. project-<br/>ing eighteen
                    inches out from the sides of their<br/> heads — frightfully painted and cut —
                    the Squaws and<br/>others, with tails of wild beasts passing over the top<br/>
                    of their heads, and hanging down their backs. But<br/> my genius, pen, and even
                    imagination in its strong-<br/>est picturesques, must fall short of the
                    shocking,<br/> striking, curious prospect of these northern inhabi-<br/>tants of
                    the wilderness. They had drunk rum to<br/> excess, before we reached them.
                    Several were much<br/> disguised. The more sober shook hands, and ap-<br/>peared
                    friendly, to whom I gave a small present.<br/> Yet two very stout, grim,
                    middle-aged men, were<br/> raised into rage and anger at us, loudly saying
                    —<br/> shemochteman! shemochteman! I said no; not she-<br/>mochteman — brothers,
                    from <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. At which<br/> they rose
                    higher, and more clamorous. We found<br/> they could understand little or none
                    of our conver-<br/>sation. Some of the young Indians, meanwhile,<br/> were
                    singing the hair off a small animal over a fire,<br/> preparing for breakfast.
                    We conjectured it to be a<br/> puppy.</p>
<p>My heart felt exceeding sorrowful, and the lan-<br/>guage of my soul was, how
                    much owest thou unto<br/> thy Lord! The picture of these poor degraded
                    ani-<br/>mals in human shape, involved many serious consi-<br/>derations
                    respecting their approaching Council; where <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_087" n="87"></pb> would probably be many hundreds, more wild
                    and<br/> ferocious than these. My mind was covered with<br/> lamentation
                    respecting the cause of such degrada-<br/>tion, which, at least in part, appears
                    to arise from<br/> abandoned and profligate white people having the<br/>
                    greatest intercourse with them in their trade, and<br/> towns; to which,
                    stimulated by the love of money,<br/> they resort, at the risk of their lives —
                    carrying their<br/> vices, immoralities, and bad example with them.<br/> These,
                    the poor uncultivated Indians easily imbibe;<br/> and, taking root in a soil,
                    adapted to receive evil<br/> seed, produce fruit, dreadful to behold.</p>
<p>The greatest discouragements attending from day<br/> to day respecting the
                    desired peace, arise from a<br/> query or doubt, that a neglect of religious
                    duty to-<br/>wards these poor people in earlier time, might be<br/> rewarded by
                    a continuance of unrelenting, savage<br/> chastisement on our borders, from the
                    old inhabitants<br/> of the land; whose murderous practices and their<br/> cruel
                    instruments of death, and engines of destruc-<br/>tion, I tremble to relate —
                    such as rifles, bayonets,<br/> scalping knives, and tomahawks of brass and
                    steel;<br/> and the bodies of some almost covered over with<br/> silver, tin and
                    other plates, broaches, bobs, &amp;c. as<br/> hostile ensigns. In all which, may
                    I not say with<br/> sorrow and blushing, they have been equalled, if<br/> not
                    exceeded, by the professed followers of the meek<br/> and humble Jesus, whose
                    holy kingdom and divine<br/> law suffer violence arid depression, to a
                    mournful<br/> degree.</p>
<p>This day, we dined at the mess house, with about<br/> sixteen respectable British
                    officers; all young gen-<br/>tlemen from Great Britian and Ireland: several
                    of<br/> whom were estated men, to a great amount. They <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_088" n="88"></pb> behaved with a modest civility, far exceeding
                    my<br/> expectation from military characters. The enter-<br/>tainment was
                    luxuriously sumptuous, and hospitable,<br/> as to flesh, fish, fruit, and
                    vegetables, with variety<br/> of wines and excellent London porter. We
                    dined<br/> at four o'clock, and spent till near sunset in agree-<br/>able
                    conversation, on various subjects — such as reli-<br/>gion, governments, war,
                    peace, theatrical exhibitions;<br/> and, at the conclusion, they begged leave to
                    drink<br/> a toast; which, out of complaisance, they dispensed<br/> with, except
                    the King's health. We told them we<br/> could not encourage the practice, as it
                    frequently<br/> proved an inlet to intemperance, and sometimes
                    in-<br/>toxication; which they granted — nevertheless they<br/> took the liberty
                    to drink, success to the Quakers in<br/> the present honourable, and
                    disinterested underta-<br/>king.</p>
<p>After night, a lad named <a href="/people/dfraz1">Daniel Frazer<persname key="dfraz1"></persname></a>, came
                    to<br/> our lodgings. He told us he was taken prisoner by<br/> the Indians, out
                    of Russell county in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>. Here<br/> came
                    also, <a href="/people/jhenr1">James Henry<persname key="jhenr1"></persname></a>, a smart young man, a
                    pri-<br/>soner with the <a href="/people/blind">Blind Chief<persname key="blind"></persname></a>, near the
                    mouth of the<br/>
<geogname key="rouger">river Roosh</geogname>, twelve miles from <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. He is adopt-<br/>ed; which renders his case
                    difficult. They have put<br/> jewels in his nose and ears, and figured him like
                    an<br/> Indian. He is desirous of returning to his relations<br/> near
                        <a href="/places/geort">Georgetown<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, Eastern Shore of Maryland.
                    In<br/> this house is hired a young woman, whose name is<br/> Field, taken from
                    Ohio, below <a href="/places/fpitt1">Fort Pitt<placename key="fpitt1"></placename></a>, where her<br/> father
                    lived when she was taken. We have met<br/> with divers others, whose cases
                    excite sympathy<br/> and concern, and to which attention has been paid;<br/> but
                    we thought it most prudent not to make strenuous<br/> exertions at present, lest
                    it might operate to our dis-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_089" n="89"></pb>advantage
                    at the treaty, in procuring the enlarge-<br/>ment of prisoners more
                    generally.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-15">15th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p><a href="/people/apark1">Abiah Park<persname key="apark1"></persname></a>
                    came to see us. He is a trader<br/> with the Indians. He entertains doubts of a
                    peace;<br/> yet says, if one can be made, it will be permanent.<br/> This
                    forenoon felt easy to appoint a meeting, to be-<br/>gin at ten o'clock
                    to-morrow, at a shop in the ship-<br/>yard, under the direction of <a href="/people/wbak">William Baker<persname key="wbak"></persname></a>, a Friend<br/> in principle, and cousin
                    to <a href="/people/gbake1">George Baker<persname key="gbake1"></persname></a> of <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>In the evening several Indians of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot tribe<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> came to our lodgings
                    to see us. They live<br/>about twenty miles from this place, at a town called<br/>
<a href="/places/mongu">Mogogam<placename key="mongu"></placename></a>. One <a href="/people/ssand1">Samuel
                        Sanders<persname key="ssand1"></persname></a>, a Scotchman, who<br/> lives with them, interpreted. They
                    told us they<br/>had heard their fathers say, the Quakers were hon-<br/>est, and
                    never wronged them; and they hoped we<br/> would stand for justice, and not see
                    them wronged,<br/> at the treaty. We informed them we came in love to<br/> see
                    them, and to renew old friendship; that the power<br/> did not lay with us — but
                    we believed the commis-<br/>sioners were sincerely disposed for peace.
                    There<br/> also came to our lodgings, a party of the <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a> —<br/> an old chief and several
                    warriors, one of whom had<br/> a human scalp, with beautiful fair curled hair on
                    it,<br/> tied to his ear. These were some of those, who, a<br/> day or two
                    before, had treated us so roughly. A<br/> white man who stood near us at that
                    time, and un-<br/>derstood their language, told us they had a desire<br/> to
                    have our scalps. They appear to be a terrible<br/> nation, fierce, insolent and
                    warlike; and, I believe,<br/> exceedingly injured by their intercourse with
                    the<br/> white people, especially the French, many of whom<br/> are little more
                    refined than they. Their almost in-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_090" n="90"></pb>
                    cessant importunity for rum, made the interview not<br/> so agreeable. We mostly
                    evaded giving them liquor,<br/> and substituted pipes and tobacco, to put them
                    off.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-16">16th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>First of the week. Went to meeting,
                    where<br/> a large number of the inhabitants of the town, and<br/> military men,
                    assembled. I believe it was a solid<br/> season, and truth's testimony was
                    exalted over all<br/> opposition; notwithstanding rawness and dark
                    in-<br/>sensibility were painfully prevalent. We came to<br/> our lodgings, and
                    dined with two <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>
                    chiefs,<br/> who had been to see us the preceding evening. —<br/> They behaved
                    with decency at table, equal to any<br/> of us; handled their knife and fork
                    well, eat mode-<br/>rately, drank two glasses of wine, and through the<br/>
                    whole, conducted with a decorum that would do ho-<br/>nour to hundreds of white
                    people. We afterwards<br/> went down the river in <a href="/people/cengl1">Col.
                        England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>'s boat, about<br/> six miles, to the house of <a href="/people/jpowe1">Judge Powell<persname key="jpowe1"></persname></a>, where we<br/> had appointed a meeting.
                    The <a href="/people/jpowe1">Judge<persname key="jpowe1"></persname></a> and his fami-<br/>ly being gone to
                    England, his steward had kindly<br/> offered his house. A considerable number
                    conve-<br/>ned, and I was comforted in a belief that the ever-<br/>lasting
                    gospel was preached in Canada. After which<br/> we returned to our lodgings.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-17">17th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>This morning there were many
                    unfavour-<br/>able reports respecting the hostile dispositions of the<br/>
                    Indians passing on to the treaty. The circumstances<br/> of things appear very
                    critical, and alarming. Even<br/> our personal safety is called in question, and
                    much<br/> doubted, unless the commissioners have very exten-<br/>sive powers. As
                    I was writing in the chamber<br/> where I lodged, two <a href="/organizations/Wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="Wyandot"></orgname></a>, much in liquor, came<br/> up into the
                    room, and teazed me for rum. I put<br/> them off. After some time they laughed, shook<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_091" n="91"></pb> hands and departed. At which I was glad,
                    as I was<br/> alone. Dined with <a href="/people/cengl1">Capt. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="/people/cleab1">Capt. Leaburn<persname key="cleab1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/mandr1">Maj. Andrews<persname key="mandr1"></persname></a> and several other military
                    gentlemen,<br/> and two of their ladies. They were very courteous<br/> and
                    polite.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-18">18th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>We wrote a letter two days ago, in
                    order<br/> to hasten the commissioners to come forward to this<br/> place, being
                    more contiguous to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, and more<br/> in
                    the way of information. This morning we wrote<br/> a few lines to <a href="/people/amcke1">Col. McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>, at the great preparative<br/> council at
                        <geogname key="miamr1">Miami rapids</geogname>, expressive of our
                    peace-<br/>able mission.</p>
<p> Ten principal Indians, <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/cayugaind">Cayugas<orgname key="cayugaind"></orgname></a>,<br/> came to see us. Several of them old men, with<br/>
                    gray hairs, and furrowed brows; evident marks of<br/>a round of years, attended
                    with variety of hardships,<br/> exercise, sorrow and pain. Their depressed
                    coun-<br/>tenances awakened all the compassionate feelings of<br/> my mind,
                    towards them. But my agency seemed so<br/> feeble, I could only retire into
                    solemn quietude, and<br/> intercede the common Father, to be the comfort
                    and<br/> prop of their declining years. The old Fish-carrier<br/> was one of the
                    number.</p>
<p>This day, my exercise of mind was heavy, and<br/> my heart sorrowful, in a
                    feeling of the sufferings of<br/> the pure Seed in this place, and the cruelty
                    and op-<br/>pression which reign among the children of men,<br/> even of the
                    most polished nations. What enormous<br/> salaries are given to military
                    officers, both sea and<br/> land, as also to officers in civil government, who
                    too<br/> generally stand opposed, with thousands of others<br/> in more inferior
                    stations, to the spreading and in-<br/>crease of the kingdom and government of
                    the Prince<br/> of Peace. In a little interview with <a href="/people/cmuns1">Capt. Munsey<persname key="cmuns1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_092" n="92"></pb> a sprightly British officer, I took the
                    liberty to men-<br/>tion the possibility, that when the broils in France<br/>
                    should subside, the African slave trade be abolished,<br/> and a permanent peace
                    concluded with our Ameri-<br/>can Indians, all this globe might be at peace;
                    and<br/> that swords (of which he had one by his side) might<br/> be beaten into
                    ploughshares. He quickly replied,<br/> he hoped not to see such a time, as it
                    would also<br/> beat up his bread and butter, (meaning his living.)<br/> Such
                    are the views of too many, in this day.</p>
<p>A middle aged Indian, of the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware tribe<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, dined<br/> with us. He talked a little English,
                    by which we<br/> understood he was in possession of several sheets of<br/>
                    ancient writings; that he had heard of Friends, and<br/> just faintly remembered
                        <a href="/people/zhest1">Z. Heston<persname key="zhest1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a><br/> being at their town. He said there were but
                        <a href="/people/bukon1">Buchon-geholas<persname key="bukon1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cpipe1">Pipe<persname key="cpipe1"></persname></a>, and two other chiefs belonging to their<br/>
                    nation; that we might depend, if they said peace, it<br/> would be peace; but if
                    they said war, it would be<br/> war. Also said, we would find the middle
                    tribes<br/> more faithful and manly than the <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a> and<br/>
<a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>; for they were
                    treacherous. I told him,<br/> they had called us Shemochteman, or Big Knife,
                    and<br/> said they wanted our scalps; at which he laughed.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-19">19th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Crossed the river, and went down the
                    east-<br/>ern bank four miles, to the house of <a href="/people/jmess1">John
                        Missiner<persname key="jmess1"></persname></a>,<br/> where we had a solemn season, with a number
                    of<br/> his neighbours, to the contriting of the hearts of di-<br/>vers present.
                    Lodged with him that night.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-20">20th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>This morning had a religious
                    opportunity<br/> in his family, in which, and the preceding meeting,<br/> dear
                        <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> was favoured, in an
                    extraordinary<br/> manner. After parting with them, we walked up<br/> the river
                    about a mile, called at the house of <a href="/people/fcorn1">Francis
<persname key="fcorn1"></persname></a>, and had
                    conversation with him and his<br/> precious wife Anna, on the subjects of water
                    bap-<br/>tism, the bread and wine, &amp;c.; which they endeavour-<br/>ed, for a
                    while, to defend; but at length gave it up.<br/> We likewise had a close
                    conversation with a French<br/> militia captain, on the subject of war, which we
                    held<br/> to be incompatible with the purity, spirit, and pre-<br/>cepts of the
                    gospel. To the general scope of which,<br/> he assented; but alleged, that
                    according to the oath<br/> of allegiance to his king, when he ordered
                    martial<br/> enterprises, he must obey; and that his king must<br/> be
                    responsible for what was done. We silenced his<br/> arguments; and proceeded to
                        <a href="/people/farno1">Frederick Arnold<persname key="farno1"></persname></a>'s.<br/>On the way, I went
                    to visit a man who was deranged.<br/> He was chained in a barn. At first, he
                    would nei-<br/>ther look at me, nor speak to me. He was sitting<br/> down. I
                    spoke to him in the fear of the Lord, and<br/> desired him not to be
                    discouraged; but trust in the<br/> Lord; for he was come to seek and to save
                    that which<br/> was lost. He then lifted up his eyes, and stared at<br/> me very
                    wildly. I said, I hoped he would be bet-<br/>ter. He said, he hoped he would. He
                    then stood<br/> up on his feet, and said, my trust is in the Lord,<br/> and not
                    in going into the water. I learned he had<br/> been pressed by some zealous
                    Baptists to undergo that<br/> operation, which he could not consent to. I
                    gave<br/> him some further counsel, and left him. I heard,<br/> next day he was
                    so rational as to be unchained.—<br/> Lodged with <a href="/people/farno1">Frederick Arnold<persname key="farno1"></persname></a>, a long bearded Tun-<br/>ker, an inoffensive
                    man; but, like his brethren, and<br/> too many others, loves money.</p></div>

                        Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> and myself walked several<br/> miles up the river, and
                    were ferried over it in a<br/> canoe, by a Frenchman. The river is about three-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_094" n="94"></pb> quarters of a mile wide, opposite the
                    town. In this<br/> excursion I made the following observations:</p>
<p> From <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> up to this place, is
                    eighteen<br/> miles. Each farm is laid out about forty perches on<br/> the river
                    — mostly improved, with houses, gardens,<br/> and orchards; and extending back,
                    where the land is<br/> level, and abounds with grass, and where hundreds<br/> of
                    cattle thrive exceedingly, producing beef, butter,<br/> cheese, veal, &amp;c. in
                    plenty. Their winters are about<br/> four months, in which it is requisite to
                    feed stock.<br/> The country, at present, is excellently adapted for<br/>
                    raising live stock. The soil is mixed, and various,<br/> clay, gravel, sand,
                    &amp;c. Here are fine fields of wheat,<br/> and peas, but too wet for corn. Tile
                    whole country<br/> is level, to a fault, without a stone, except on
                    islands<br/>in the mouth of the river Croeseel, and on the banks<br/> of the
                    lake, which are generally limestone — these<br/> are monopolized by old Indian
                    traders, and sold to<br/> the inhabitants, at a high rate, for the purpose
                    of<br/> building their chimnies, &amp;c.</p>
<p>
<a href="/places/hogis">Hog Island<placename key="hogis"></placename></a> is in sight, above the garrison.
                    It<br/> appears to be well timbered. I am told it took its<br/> name from this
                    circumstance; being infested with<br/> rattlesnakes to such a degree that people
                    were afraid<br/> to enter upon it; and, as the best expedient, they<br/>turned
                    on it a large herd of three or four year old<br/> swine. In time, the hogs
                    destroyed the reptiles so that<br/> it became habitable, and thence was called
                        <a href="/places/hogis">Hog Island<placename key="hogis"></placename></a>.</p>
<p> Large rafts of excellent timber are brought into<br/> the king's yard, in this
                    place, from the <geogname key="thame">river Lau-<br/>trench</geogname>; and some
                    fine masts and beams, come by<br/> water out of <geogname key="lakeh">lake
                        Huron</geogname>, quite through <geogname key="lakst">lake St.
                        Clair</geogname>.<br/> The changes of weather, are great and frequent<br/>
                    here. There are no eels found in the waters, nor <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_095" n="95"></pb> rats on the land, west, or above the <geogname key="niagf">great Falls of<br/> Niagara</geogname>. Here is an abundance of
                    corn boiled in strong<br/> lye, and made into what we call slut hominy, to
                    go<br/> in the north-west trade, an far as a place called the<br/> Black North,
                    said to be eighteen hundred miles dis-<br/>tant, now in the hands of British and
                    Scotch mer-<br/>chants. They go thither in batteaux. I saw a man<br/> who
                    resided there three years; who says, early in<br/> the spring they set out with
                    choice peltry, such as<br/> beaver, otter, minks, martins, &amp;c. come to the
                    great<br/> portage, where they are met by the batteaux from<br/>
<a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, exchange their load, and each
                    returns just<br/> as winter sets in. To the north-west posts, Indians<br/>
                    frequently come that never saw a white man before.<br/> They are clothed in
                    buffaloe and bear skins, neatly<br/> softened, whitened and dressed. They are
                    kind and<br/> good natured, use bows and arrows, and have no<br/> fire arms.
                    They cover their cabins with large rough<br/> skins: as the merchants rarely
                    purchase even deer<br/> skins; having such an abundance of more rich furs,<br/>
                    that they cannot send the coarse skins forward. This<br/> trade is rich and
                    extensive, and employs the capitals<br/> of many merchants, both in England and
                    Canada.<br/> The great channel of this trade is down the <geogname key="grand">Grand<br/> river</geogname> from <geogname key="lakeh">Huron
                        lake</geogname>, to which is but a short car-<br/>rying place. An immense
                    quantity of skins pass<br/> this way. The whole of the trade makes way for<br/>
                    large numbers of Canadian watermen to get a living.<br/> The wages for them, and
                    also for hands on land,<br/> average about six pounds a month. Cows sell at
                    fif-<br/>teen pounds a head— sheep, six dollars a piece —<br/> veal calves,
                    twelve dollars each.</p>
<p> The English and German farmers are likely to<br/> alter the manner of living,
                    and customs in this place,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_096" n="96"></pb> for the better. The old French settlers
                    in general<br/> are poor economists, and proud withal — live mise-<br/>rably at
                    home, yet appear grand abroad. It is said<br/> they live much on boiled fish,
                    supping the broth with-<br/>out either bread or salt. They are superstitiously
                    reli-<br/>gious, going to mass more than two hundred days<br/> in the year. They
                    have two large worship houses<br/> here, and a number of crosses, set up on the
                    banks of<br/> the river and other places, to evince their christianity.</p></div>

<p>
                    Walked up the river about four miles, to
                    a<br/> place called <geogname key="blood">Bloody Bridge</geogname>, from a
                    contest which<br/> happened there between the British, Canadians, and<br/>
                    Indians, where many fell. We called at a respect-<br/>able French farmer's, who
                    took us into a curious<br/> garden of fruit, flowers, &amp;c. also into his
                    house,<br/> where were pictures, representing Christ on the<br/> Cross, old
                    Saints, &amp;c. <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> talked
                    French<br/> to them; they appeared pleased, and behaved polite-<br/>ly. Though
                    much apparent superstition and idola-<br/>try are indulged amongst them, yet I
                    hope many<br/> are looking beyond it to the more substantial parts<br/> of true
                    worship: although I have seen them after<br/> mass, frolicking and horse racing
                    in the road pass-<br/>ing the worship house, or as it were, at the door,<br/>
                    the remaining part of the day, to their reproach.<br/> The buildings on the
                    banks of the river, though low,<br/> being mostly a story and a half, are
                    beautiful, and<br/> the farms fertile — but their fuel and rails are all to<br/>
                    be drawn about four miles. On our return, we fell<br/> in with several <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawa<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a> camps — they had
                    tents of<br/> mats curiously wrought of flags, reeds, rushes, &amp;c.<br/> Their
                    canoes were made of bark, with great skill and<br/> ingenuity.</p></div>

<p>
                    First-day. Had a meeting in the
                    sail-loft,<br/> with a considerable number of people. It was a time<br/>of
                    stripping and heavy exercise; yet I trust the gos-<br/>pel testimony did not
                    suffer reproach. A number of<br/> Indians came to see us, and behaved civilly.
                    One<br/> said, he was glad at his heart to see us.</p></div>

                    Taken up in writing home.</p></div>

<p>
                    Air cold and chilly. This forenoon a
                    wolf<br/> was brought to the wharf, which was shot on <a href="/places/hogis">Hog Island<placename key="hogis"></placename></a>. It is said to have been floated there
                    from<br/> the main land last winter on a cake of ice. Since<br/> which time he
                    has killed sixty pigs. The owner of<br/> the island advertised twenty dollars
                    for his head.<br/> A half Indian shot him. He was higher than any<br/> dog I
                    ever saw, and his teeth larger and stronger<br/> than a mastiff's. He was about
                    six feet long from<br/> the end of the nose to the feet or paws of the hind<br/>
                    legs — of a grayish colour, short, broad ears, and a <br/>long hairy, but not
                    bushy, tail. </p>
<p> This morning we received account, that a compa-<br/>ny of <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawa Indians<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a> who had got too much
                    rum,<br/> differed in their tent on the commons. Two of them<br/> attacked a
                    third, and stabbed him to death with their<br/> knives. A sorrowful instance of
                    the shocking, hor-<br/>rid effects of this man-bane, (distilled spirits.) This
                    <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_098" n="98"></pb> has been the great engine, and mainspring, which<br/>has
                    prepared the way and led to thousands of acts of<br/>hostility, and murders
                    without number. It has evi-<br/>dently appeared to me, to be the greatest
                    obstacle in<br/> the way of the civilization and happiness of the In-<br/>dian
                    natives — the removal of which, loudly calls for<br/> the united exertions of
                    our Government, and that of <br/>Great Britian, together with the unremitting
                    endea-<br/>vours of all Christians, and lovers of mankind. I<br/>consider this
                    important object of so great magnitude,<br/> as hardly to be equalled by any
                    terrestrial achieve-<br/>ment. Oh! that legislators would lay it more
                    deep-<br/>ly to heart, and the professed followers of Jesus,<br/> lift up a glorious
                    ensign against this mighty destroy-<br/>er of mankind! Instead of which, sorrow
                    is now<br/>added to affliction, until blood touches blood, by<br/> furbished
                    swords, harnessed men and horses, glitter-<br/>ing spears, sounding drums and
                    trumpets — while<br/>elated captains, colonels, and generals, glorying
                    in<br/>their multitude and their pomp, forget that "Tophet<br/>is ordained of
                    old" for those, and that they should<br/> descend into it — forgetting also “the
                    sword that is<br/> bathed, and that shall come upon the mountains of<br/>Idumea"
                    — forgetting too, the God of armies, who is<br/>able, by the diminutive fly or
                    worm, to lay the glory<br/> and pomp of all nations in the dust — nor
                    consider-<br/>ing that it is righteousness which exalteth a nation.</p>
<p>This town is piquetted all round. It consists of<br/>about one hundred and fifty
                    houses, crowded togeth-<br/>er. The fort lays adjoining the town, on the
                    north<br/> side. Watchmen are placed at four gates leading<br/>into the town;
                    sentinels also stand on the ramparts<br/> and bastions of the fortifications,
                    who cry from one<br/> to another, every fifteen minutes, from nine in the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_099" n="99"></pb> evening, to three o'clock in the morning, <emph rend="italic">all
                        is well</emph>,<br/> and the last cries, <emph rend="italic">all is very
                        well</emph>. But it appeared<br/> a superficial sound to me. This day we
                    dined at<br/> W.F.'s, which I think nothing could have induced<br/>us to
                    attempt, but the remembrance of our great Ex-<br/>ample being a friend of
                    sinners. The old man treat-<br/>ed us with generous hospitality, which we
                    requited<br/> with plain dealing.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-26">26th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Twenty-eight Indians arrived to-day, from<br/>
<a href="/places/michi">McInoi, [Michilimackinac]<placename key="michi"></placename></a> on their way to
                    the<br/> Council. Dined at <a href="/people/jaski1">John Askin<persname key="jaski1"></persname></a>'s, one
                    of the most<br/>respectable merchants in this place. We were en-<br/>tertained
                    in a pleasing manner. His wife is a French<br/> woman, of an amiable, easy,
                    graceful deportment.<br/> We had the company of <a href="/people/dwrig1">Dr.law
                        Wright<persname key="dwrig1"></persname></a>, lately married<br/> to <a href="/people/cgran1">Commodore
                        Grant<persname key="cgran1"></persname></a>'s daughter, a discreet young<br/>woman, who was present;
                    also <a href="/people/lsmit1">Lawyer Smith<persname key="lsmit1"></persname></a>, a<br/>British merchant,
                        <a href="/people/jaski1">John Askin<persname key="jaski1"></persname></a>'s daughter, an agree-<br/>able
                    young girl, and others. Our topics were, re-<br/>signation and dependence on
                    Divine support, in the<br/> use of prudent and lawful endeavours, for both
                    spi-<br/>ritual and temporal blessings. The origin of the<br/>Indians, with
                    remarks on many traces of antiquity<br/> found in the wilderness. From all
                    which, with<br/>their sacrifices; observations of moons; care for
                    the<br/>sepulchres, and bones of their deceased ancestors;<br/>division into so
                    many tribes, — the probability, and<br/>almost certainty, was inferred, of their
                    being the<br/>dispersed tribes of Israel; and therefore, from Scrip-<br/>ture
                    testimony and prophecy (some part of which<br/>was fulfilled, which strongly
                    corroborated that which<br/> yet remained) it was inferrible that they would
                    be<br/> restored, — not to a Jewish, ceremonious Israel, but to<br/>a spiritual
                    Israel of the circumcision, made without<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_100" n="100"></pb> hands. It was also urged, that it was our duty
                    to<br/>use endeavours to promote, and pray for this, in pre-<br/>ference to
                    effecting their extermination. For which<br/> purpose, many dark and diabolical
                    machinations are<br/> proposed; one of these I had recently heard of, viz.<br/>
                    To take a large quantity of liquor, of which they<br/> are extremely fond, and
                    infuse the strongest poison<br/> therein: take it into an army which should
                    make<br/> feint shows, until the body of them should be col-<br/>lected, then
                    make a sham battle, and retreat with<br/> precipitation, leaving the liquor
                    behind. The sub-<br/>ject was closely combated, and I thought, ended in<br/>
                    favor of the cause of injured humanity.</p>
<p>After our interview closed, three of us walked out<br/> to speak to the <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chiapas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>, lately arrived. We
                    met<br/> five or six of them; but they could not understand<br/> us, neither we
                    them, only this much, Chemochte-<br/>man, Bostone. I offered my hand to them
                    repeat-<br/>edly, as also did <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>,
                    which they as often<br/> refused. They had come down the lakes four
                    hun-<br/>dred miles; which shows how wide and deep the<br/> prejudice against
                    our citizens has extended.</p></div>

<p>Were visited at our lodgings by Dr. Wright,<br/>
<a href="/people/cmuns1">Capt. Munsey<persname key="cmuns1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jbroa1">Broadhead<persname key="jbroa1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jcraw1">Crawford<persname key="jcraw1"></persname></a>, and
                    several<br/> other officers, who continue very respectful to us.</p>
<p>From this place, many hundreds of bushels of<br/> hominy, go yearly to <geogname key="mackr">McInoi</geogname>, from whence it is<br/> forwarded to the
                        <a href="/places/grandp">Grand Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>; there it is parceled<br/>
                    out at one bushel to a man — who is more prudent<br/> than to use one grain in
                    his north-western route of<br/> about eighteen hundred, or as some say, two
                    thou-<br/>sand miles from the <a href="/places/grandp">Grand Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>,
                    as it is to be his<br/> main support in case of sickness, accidents, &amp;c.
                    one<br/> whole year. But while health remains, they substi-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_101" n="101"></pb>tute huckleberries in their season, which they
                    dry<br/> in the smoke, to take off the insipid sweet taste —<br/> other times,
                    wild rye is gathered and boiled — at<br/> others, they catch large fish, boil
                    them, select the<br/> large bones, which being pounded or beaten, are<br/>
                    packed in the skin of some beast just taken off, to<br/> preserve for use. They
                    kill beasts and birds, eat <br/>the flesh and drink the blood, without either
                    bread<br/> or salt. Thus they live.</p>
<p> The trade is principally carried on (that is, the<br/> labour,) by Canadians,
                    who are quite as hardy, and<br/> almost as savage, as the Indians themselves.
                    They<br/> are not allowed by the merchants at <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, to<br/> take into the north-west, more than one
                    bushel, as<br/> their canoes must be of just such a weight as two<br/> men can
                    carry on their shoulders, and will just hold<br/> so much, as is completely
                    filled with goods suita-<br/>ble for Indian trade. The company has arrived
                    at<br/> great opulence by this business. They extend it by<br/> their accounts,
                    so far as to mix, at times, and meet<br/> with merchants of the wilderness like
                    themselves,<br/> employed by the Hudson Bay company. One old man<br/> is
                    returned, whom <a href="/people/jaski1">John Askin<persname key="jaski1"></persname></a> says he never
                    knew<br/> to deviate from the truth, as too many travellers do:<br/> He says he
                    has explored those high latitudes fifty<br/> years, and that far beyond all
                    buffaloes, bears, and<br/> large beasts of any kind; the country there will
                    pro-<br/>duce no kind of grain, nor large trees; but the most<br/> fine furs,
                    the beaver, otter, and martin skins, always<br/> selling at market for a third
                    more than middle furs.<br/><a href="/people/jaski1">Askin<persname key="jaski1"></persname></a> says,
                        <a href="/people/ahenr1">Alexander Henry<persname key="ahenr1"></persname></a> frequently tried to<br/>
                    raise corn on the banks of <geogname key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogname>, but
                    never<br/> could get one ear in perfection. All which, and<br/> abundance more
                    that might be truly inserted, con-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_102" n="102"></pb>spire to give forty degrees north latitude the prefer-<br/>ence for human
                    beings to breathe in. This evening,<br/> had a visit from <a href="/people/cdrak1">Capt. John Drake<persname key="cdrak1"></persname></a>, an old Guinea<br/> trader, now a navigator on
                    these lakes, remarkable<br/> for using no kind of drink but water; yet is a
                    healthy,<br/> robust man. He is employed in the north-west trade,<br/> and just
                    arrived from the Falls of <a href="/people/stmar">St. Mary<persname key="stmar"></persname></a>, at the<br/>
                    entrance into <geogname key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogname>. On this trade,
                    the<br/>company has one topsail vessel, and a larger on the<br/>stocks, ready to
                    launch. They navigate that lake<br/> about four hundred miles, and some distance
                    up a<br/> river, to the <a href="/places/grandp">Grand Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a> —
                    where the goods are<br/>taken to canoes, by about one thousand men.
                    These<br/>canoes run, as it is supposed, at least fifteen hundred<br/> miles,
                    west-north-west — which requires them to be<br/> exceedingly industrious to make
                    the post before<br/> winter — and when winter sets in a week or two<br/> sooner
                    than common, they are frequently caught by<br/> the way.</p>
<p>One <a href="/people/amack1">McKenzie<persname key="amack1"></persname></a>, and ten men, set out last
                    spring<br/> was a year, from the Black, or by some called the<br/> Grand North
                    Post, to attempt further discoveries;<br/> they have not been heard of since. He
                    had been<br/> out once before, for twelve months; and met with<br/> mountains of
                    salt ice. He now expects to be out<br/> three years. Some of these northern
                    adventurers<br/> return, and appear as well as those who remain at<br/> home,
                    feasting on delicacies. In short, the young<br/> men hereaway, think themselves
                    no more accom-<br/>plished for company or conversation, not having<br/> taken
                    this journey, than our young gentlemen, not<br/> having taken the tour of
                    Europe.</p>
<p>A day or two past, we had the company of five<br/>
<a href="/organizations/moraind">Moravian Indians<orgname key="moraind"></orgname></a>,
                    whose sorrowful history deeply<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_103" n="103"></pb>
                    affected us. After ninety-six of their people had<br/>been barbarously murdered
                    at <a href="/places/muski">Muskingum<placename key="muski"></placename></a>, they<br/> were terrified, and
                    driven from one place to an-<br/>other, seven times. Their last movement was
                    to<br/> the <geogname key="thame">river Traunch, or Thames</geogname>. They put
                    in seventy<br/> acres of corn last year, which grew to good size,<br/> but being
                    a little too late, was killed by the frost.<br/> By which means, about one
                    hundred and forty men,<br/> women, and children, are under great suffering,
                    for<br/> want of bread. Government furnished two hundred<br/> bushels of corn
                    for their relief, which was nearly<br/> expended. On consideration of their
                    being as the<br/> first fruits of Indian civilization, and are reputed<br/> very
                    industrious; as also on consideration of the<br/> concern of our society for the
                    natives of the land,<br/> and the business in which we were embarked, we,<br/>
                    on conferring together, were united in prospect,<br/> that it would be right,
                    strangers and pilgrims as we<br/> were, to try our credit to supply them with
                    one<br/> hundred dollars worth of corn and flour. Which<br/> being procured from
                        <a href="/people/mdols">Matthew Dolson<persname key="mdols"></persname></a>, we furnished<br/> them with
                    it; for which they and their missionary,<br/>
<a href="/people/gsans1">Sensemer<persname key="gsans1"></persname></a>, appeared thankful; and I believe it
                    had a<br/> good savour amongst the people here. We wrote<br/>a short epistle,
                    expressive of our good wishes for,<br/> and kind remembrance of them, and sent
                    by <a href="/people/swhit1">Sam.White<persname key="swhit1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jkilb1">John
                        Kilbuck<persname key="jkilb1"></persname></a>, and their companions, to<br/>
<a href="/people/dzeis1">David Zeisberger<persname key="dzeis1"></persname></a>, to be read generally, among
                    their<br/> society at home.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-28">28th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Warm and sultry. Stayed mostly at our<br/>
                    lodgings. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-29">29th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had a visit from a <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot chief<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, who ap-<br/>peared to have
                    much concern respecting the ap-<br/>proaching treaty — also, a remembrance of
                        former<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_104" n="104"></pb> treaties and belts. Some
                    long and broad belts, he<br/>said they had, that were intended, not only to
                    bind<br/> us by the hands, but clasp us by the arms, so that<br/> no small
                    accidents should in future, be able to make<br/> a separation. And that,
                    notwithstanding all that had<br/> happened, the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> felt some of the old
                    affec-<br/>tion to possess their breasts, and he hoped we would<br/>find it so
                    at the general Council: but could speak for<br/>none but themselves. We desired
                    our interpreter,<br/>
<a href="/people/jheck1">J. Heckewelder<persname key="jheck1"></persname></a>, to assure him we possessed the
                    same<br/>love and friendship for them, and for all other Indians,<br/> that we,
                    or our forefathers, ever did — that our prin-<br/>ciples had always restrained
                    us from making war<br/>against them. But when we believed the govern-<br/>ment
                    was disposed to make peace with them, on<br/>principles of justice, we were
                    willing to leave our<br/>homes and near connexions, and at a great
                    expense,<br/>undertake a long and hazardous journey, to endea-<br/>vour to
                    promote it, and to be present at the conclu-<br/>ding of so good a work. On
                    delivery of which, he<br/>said, he knew long ago we did not fight, but
                    were<br/>for peace. He then got up, and shook hands with<br/>Friends, then sat
                    down, and spoke in substance as fol-<br/>lows: That as we had come a long
                    journey, and were<br/>all preserved in health, it was evident the
                    Great<br/>Spirit was pleased with our coming; and he hoped<br/>some good would
                    be done, and that the Great Spirit<br/>would bring us home in the same good
                    health, with<br/>peace and joy. To which we replied, we were glad<br/>of such an
                    opportunity to talk with him, and if the<br/>great and good work of peace could
                    be effected, we<br/>hoped we should return home with joy and peace;<br/>which
                    was all the reward we wanted or looked for.<br/> He asked whether it would be
                    disagreeable, if he <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_105" n="105"></pb> was to come and
                    dine with us, to which we invited<br/>him.</p>
<p>We were also visited this morning by <a href="/people/ab">Abram<persname key="ab"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/katha">Katherine<persname key="katha"></persname></a> his wife, <a href="/people/rebek">Rebekah<persname key="rebek"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/mary">Mary<persname key="mary"></persname></a>, his
                    daugh-<br/>ters. They live at <geogname key="miamr1">Miami Rapids</geogname>,
                    are <a href="/organizations/mahican">Mohickons<orgname key="mahican"></orgname></a>,<br/>and
                    appear much civilized. Also, some <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnee<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a><br/>women, one a widow, who, because of her
                    situation,<br/> had taken off her bobs, jewels, and trinkets, with<br/>which the
                    others shone with splendor, having massy<br/>plates of silver about them, I have
                    no doubt, to an<br/> amount that would have clothed them in silk and<br/>velvet.
                    Had it not been for the profuse introduction<br/>of distilled spirits amongst
                    these people, and the<br/>frauds in consequence of it,<br/> imposed upon them,
                    al-<br/>so the ravages and depredations of war, with multi-<br/>plied murders
                    and thefts, they would at this day have<br/>been a very wealthy people in silver
                    and gold, cat-<br/>tle and horses. But the reverse is, at present,
                    their<br/>sorrowful situation, I fear to our condemnation. The<br/>history of
                    their barbarity, treachery, and breach of<br/>faith to the white people, and to
                    one another, which<br/>we have heard rehearsed by people well
                    acquainted<br/>with facts, since we arrived here, would be painful,<br/>tedious,
                    and indeed too shocking to relate. These<br/>circumstances almost stagger the
                    faith of their best<br/>friends. Even one of the <a href="/organizations/moraind">Moravian<orgname key="moraind"></orgname></a> missionaries<br/>said, that
                    even if peace should be concluded, it<br/>would not last long, until they were
                    further chas-<br/>tised. <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> asked,
                    by what means? Did<br/>he mean the sword? It was answered, yes — not<br/>until
                    they were convinced the United States were<br/>too powerful for them, and able
                    to subject them. —<br/>These being the sentiments of those who had
                    lived<br/>long among them, solely to promote peace, and the<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_106" n="106"></pb> principles of the gospel, proved very
                    discouraging<br/>to us. They also pronounced it impossible to in-<br/>struct
                    them in the principles of justice, equity, and<br/>government; which I was not
                    willing to admit.</p>
<p> We had a visit to-day from <a href="/people/nwill1">Nathan Williams<persname key="nwill1"></persname></a>,
                    an<br/> intelligent man, especially in Indian affairs, which<br/>he has been
                    intimately acquainted with. He, in a<br/>friendly manner, suggested fears that
                    we would be<br/> either killed, or kept as hostages, at the ensuing<br/>Council.
                    And truly I am not astonished at their ideas,<br/>considering the spectacles of
                    human misery they are<br/> almost daily presented with, and the rumors
                    they<br/>hear — where tribes of Indian warriors have so fre-<br/>quently passed,
                    with their disconsolate prisoners;<br/>and with poles stuck up in the front of
                    their canoes,<br/>some with fifteen, others with thirty scalps suspend-<br/>ed
                    on them, in trophy of their courage and victory.<br/>Though it must be said in
                    honour of British huma-<br/>nity, and commendation of this government,
                    Upper<br/>Canada, and its truly respectable and generous offi-<br/>cers, they
                    have interfered to the relief of scores of<br/>prisoners, and obtained their
                    redemption at a great<br/>price. Divers of these we have met with, and
                    they<br/>appeared as the very outcasts of England and Ire-<br/>land, who, as
                        <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, and other officers,
                    told<br/>me, hardly had the manners to acknowledge the<br/>kindness, though in
                    some instances it cost one hun-<br/>dred pounds. But in case of a real American,
                    they<br/>never begrudged it.</p>
<p> This has been a high day at the Roman chapel;<br/>being canonized in honour of
                    St. Peter. They rung<br/> the bells, and it is said, carried about the host.
                    At<br/>ten, they assembled at the chapel in great numbers,<br/>men, women, and
                    children. Some kneeled, and ma-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_107" n="107"></pb>ny
                    sung aloud. I saw them through the windows,<br/>from our lodging. Many of them
                    appeared sincere.<br/>But oh! the clouds of lifeless ceremonies, of images,<br/>
                    pictures, water, wine, wafers; schemes of human<br/>policy and earthly wisdom,
                    operating as so many<br/>veils which obscure the inshining of the rays of
                    the<br/>sun of righteousness, darkening counsel, to a sorrow-<br/>ful degree,
                    often amongst men in eminent stations.<br/>Indeed, the veil of the covering,
                    spread over all na-<br/>tions, is only destroyed in proportion as we
                    approach,<br/>and ascend the Lord's peaceable, holy mountain, in<br/>the purity
                    of his saints, as little children, — where,<br/>without cloud of ceremony, or
                    mist of darkness or<br/>unbelief, their angels do behold the face or
                    appear-<br/>ance of their Father in heaven, — they behold his<br/>universal
                    love, — in his pure fear, — in the awful at-<br/>tributes of his righteous
                    judgments, — and incompre-<br/>hensible mercies, — more than heart can think,
                    or<br/>tongue can speak, — and, in abasement, they bow be-<br/>fore the name of
                    the Lord Jehovah, in whom sure-<br/>ly, is everlasting strength, and to whom, I
                    desire to<br/>commit my cause, and commend my soul, with my<br/>dear companion,
                    and our tender babes, if we should<br/>never more meet in this vale of
                    tribulation.</p>
<p> Last night, about eleven o'clock, five or six guns<br/>went off smartly one
                    after another. The report<br/>sounded unpleasant, especially, anticipating if
                    it<br/>should so happen at <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, how it
                    would pro-<br/>bably alarm. I understand it was at some wolves,<br/>which had
                    destroyed a neighbour's sheep.</p></div>

<p>
                    We were visited by a principal man of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, called the
                        <a href="/people/blind">Blind Chief<persname key="blind"></persname></a>, with his
                    nephew,<br/>grand-son, and great-grand-son, a likely lad of twelve<br/>years
                    old. They were well dressed, and appeared<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_108" n="108"></pb> friendly. We informed them, by an interpreter,
                    of<br/>our friendly motives in this visit, and explained our<br/>uniform
                    peaceable principles and practice, for more<br/>than one hundred years; and that
                    we wished to pro-<br/>mote peace in our country. He told us, eight of<br/>their
                    principal men were gone to the Council at<br/>
<geogname key="miamr1">Miami Rapids</geogname>, with pacific views and
                    intentions.<br/>They took leave of us in a decent, respectable man-<br/>ner.</p>
<p> This day, we had two meetings in the king's sail-<br/>loft, largely attended by
                    citizens, officers, and sol-<br/>diers, of <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, which, though deeply exercising,<br/>wading us through
                    mire, and dirt, and rubbish, yet<br/>were to a good degree, satisfactory.</p></div>

<p>Breakfasted at <a href="/people/celli1">Capt. Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>'s: af-<br/>terwards, attended the
                    burial of <a href="/people/ishon">Isidore Shone<persname key="ishon"></persname></a>, at<br/>the Roman
                    chapel, where the priest in his pontifical<br/>robes, was preceded by a man
                    bearing on an ensign<br/>like a halbert, a large cross; and attended by
                    singers,<br/>and two little lads, each with a candle. They, with<br/>the priest
                    and singers, were clothed in black petti-<br/>coats, and covered over the arms
                    and shoulders with<br/>a white surplice, which reached down to the
                    knee.<br/>When the coffin, which was covered with a black<br/>pall with costly
                    fringe, approached the threshold of<br/>the chapel, the bearers made a small
                    halt, the priest<br/>turned round with a brush in his hand, and
                    sprinkled<br/>water on the apparatus about the deceased. I did<br/>not go inside
                    of the house, but saw numbers of light-<br/>ed candles burning in it; which made
                    but a feint<br/>light, as the sun shone bright, and the day was ex-<br/>ceeding
                    warm. Notwithstanding which, the eccle-<br/>siastical part of the procession
                    went bare-headed,<br/> and very slow, muttering, or rather growling, a
                        sen-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_109" n="109"></pb>tence or two of Latin, over
                    and over, all the way.<br/>Indeed the whole of this religious parade,
                    appeared<br/>to have more of Jewish ceremony, or Gentile super-<br/>stition in
                    it, than Christian simplicity or gravity. —<br/>They deposited the poor
                    tabernacle under the floor,<br/> rung the bells, sung aloud, made their sanctum
                    sanc-<br/>torum resound, and then departed. Numbers of them<br/>come to mass on
                    first-day, eight or ten miles, just<br/> step in, and (they say) rhyme over
                    their paternoster,<br/>dip their finger into the font, cross themselves,
                    and<br/>out again, to drink and frolic.</p></div>

<p>
                    I went on board the Ottoway, <a href="/people/ccow">Capt. Cowan<persname key="ccow"></persname></a>,<br/> just arrived from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, in hopes of hearing from<br/>home; in
                    which I was disappointed. I found eigh-<br/>teen <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> on board, with whom I
                    had<br/> some conversation. The captain informed me, he<br/> had put sixty on
                    shore at the mouth of the <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>,<br/> on their
                    way to the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, where, we are
                    inform-<br/>ed, twelve hundred Indians are assembled. This<br/>day we received a
                    letter from <a href="/people/amcke1">Colonel McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>, con-<br/>taining
                    friendly sentiments, and an assurance that<br/>we should have timely notice of
                    the opening of the<br/>treaty. We also received one from a young man
                    on<br/>board the Chipaway, informing that <a href="/people/cbutl1">Colonel
                        Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a>,<br/> who was passenger with his Indians on board
                        <a href="/people/ccow">Capt. Cowan<persname key="ccow"></persname></a>'s vessel, came on board
                    their vessel, and in<br/>conversation in a select company, where he had no<br/>
                    suspicion, expressed, that if the commissioners should<br/>propose, or even hint
                    any other terms than what<br/>were concluded upon by the Indians, he would
                    not<br/>think it strange, if every person from the colonies,<br/>comissioners,
                    Quakers, and all, should be sacrificed<br/>on the spot; for they know no
                    distinction, but their<br/>own people. This, the young man communicated to
                        <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_110" n="110"></pb> us out of pure friendship,
                    having heard it himself:<br/>which we treasured up at present. But truly,
                    the<br/> pressure of murdering, dark, blood-thirsty spirits,<br/>from day to
                    day, is exceeding heavy; always re-<br/>quiring us to watch and pray, that we
                    may be fur-<br/>nished with the whole armour of light.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-03">3rd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>
<a href="/people/cengl1">Col.
                        England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a> came to visit us. We went to<br/>see his garden — in the
                    interview, he showed every<br/>mark of respect to Friends, and desired us as
                    often<br/> as we wished, to retire into his arbours in the heat<br/>of the day.
                    We acknowledged his kindness, and<br/> went to our lodgings to dine, where we
                    had the<br/>company of a young <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> chief. He was neat-<br/>ly dressed in Indian style. I
                    computed he had, at<br/>least, one thousand silver broaches stuck on a
                    new<br/>silk hunting shirt. He behaved at table with great<br/>gentility.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-04">4th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Fourteen Indians came to see us. They
                    ap-<br/>peared friendly. The weather exceeding warm. Al-<br/>though we are well
                    supplied with provisions, yet,<br/>the water being all brought from the river,
                    and<br/>standing in a tierce in the sunshine, makes our drink<br/>disagreeable.
                    This, with a host of flies by day, and<br/>fleas and bugs by night, added to our
                    state of sus-<br/>pense, required some fortitude and patience to keep<br/>our
                    post, without looking back, or meditating an<br/>escape.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-05">5th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had some conversation with an
                    intelligent<br/> woman, who had been taken prisoner in <a href="/places/kentu">Kentucky<placename key="kentu"></placename></a>,<br/> and separated from her husband and nine
                    children.<br/> All had been favoured to meet again except one,<br/>which she
                    says is now in <a href="/places/kentu">Kentucky<placename key="kentu"></placename></a>. She says,
                    three<br/>hundred and ninety-five persons were taken, and<br/>scattered through
                    the wilderness at the time they<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_111" n="111"></pb>
                    were, fourteen years ago. Such a situation, contrast-<br/>ed with a land of
                    peace, and the security of life,<br/>liberty, and property, may enable us to
                    make some<br/>estimate of the blessings we enjoy, and the princi-<br/>ples which
                    lead to a permanent security of them.</p>
<p> This morning the Ottoway, <a href="/people/ccow">Capt. Cowan<persname key="ccow"></persname></a>,
                    sailed<br/> for <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, to go by the way
                    of <geogname key="maume">Miami Bay</geogname>, hav-<br/>ing provisions on board
                    for <a href="/people/amcke1">McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a> and the Indians<br/>at the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>. With whom <a href="/people/celli1">Capt.
                        Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, deputy<br/>Indian agent for the British, embarked, to
                    join<br/> McKee at the council. We acquainted him repeat-<br/>edly with our
                    design in coming to this country, and<br/>our prospects of the importance of the
                    business in<br/>agitation, and engaged him to use his influence as<br/>speedily
                    as possible, to open the way for a treaty. I<br/>sent by this vessel some
                    intelligence to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,<br/>and sailed
                    up the river past <a href="/places/hogis">Hog Island<placename key="hogis"></placename></a> and <geogname key="peche">Pearl<br/>Island</geogname>, into the lower end of <geogname key="lakst">Lake St. Clair</geogname>, which<br/>is about thirty-six miles
                    long, and eighteen broad.<br/>After taking a prospect of <geogname key="gross">Gross Point</geogname>, the residence<br/>of <a href="/people/cgran1">Commodore Grant<persname key="cgran1"></persname></a>, viewed <a href="/people/nwill1">N.
                        Williams<persname key="nwill1"></persname></a>’s stone<br/>wind mill, dined at his house, and returned
                    eight or<br/>nine miles to our lodgings. <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and<br/><a href="/people/whart">William
                    Hartshorn<persname key="whart"></persname></a>, in our absence, were visited by<br/> a <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> warrior, who
                    announced to them what had<br/>before been frequently suggested to us by divers
                    per-<br/>sons, that if the commissioners did not immediately<br/>agree, that all
                    the land west of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, should
                    be<br/>evacuated, and given up by the United States, or<br/>even hinted any
                    thing to the contrary, by offering<br/>gifts or money as purchase, of which they
                    under-<br/>stood they had brought abundance with them, that<br/>none of them, or
                    their company, would ever go off<br/>the ground alive — for their fathers, who
                    are now all<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_112" n="112"></pb>gone, had sold lands for
                    knives, broaches, and rum, till<br/>they were now driven almost to the
                    sun-setting, where<br/>they were determined to make a stand. He com-<br/>plained
                    of the ruinous consequences of the introduc-<br/>tion of spirituous liquors
                    amongst their fathers, say-<br/>ing, at first, they called it bitter water, and
                    some,<br/>fiery water. But by repeated offers of it to them,<br/>they at length
                    fell in with it, to their hurt in gene-<br/>ral. He also informed, that four
                    days before he left<br/>the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, a
                    deputation of two chiefs of each nation<br/>had embarked to meet the
                    commissioners at <a href="/places/niaga">Niaga-ra<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, to let them
                    know the outlines of their conclusions,<br/>and that if the white people would
                    settle to the banks<br/>of <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, on the east
                    side, and agree that the river<br/>should be the line, they would be glad, and
                    take them<br/>by the hand, and call them brothers. All which intel-<br/>ligence,
                    he said, might be depended on as true. Our<br/>apprehensions that the
                    commissioners were vested<br/> with no such powers, and that the government
                    had<br/>no such intentions, tended to thicken the cloud which<br/>seems
                    impending over this land; as the seeds of de-<br/>struction are sowing in a
                    soil, prepared to produce<br/>shocking scenes.</p>
<p>This same Indian, getting raised with strong drink<br/>in the afternoon, made a
                    stroke with his tomahawk<br/>at one <a href="/people/sash1">Sylvester
                        Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a>, an interpreter, who had long<br/>resided with the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>; <a href="/people/sash1">Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a>’s exertions pre-<br/>vented his killing him; he
                    then knocked off our<br/>landlord's hat, who struck him several hard
                    blows,<br/>and turned him out of the house. <a href="/people/cmuns1">Capt.
                        Munsey<persname key="cmuns1"></persname></a>,<br/>being present, sent for two soldiers, who put
                    him<br/>out of the garrison. He was much enraged. Upon<br/>the whole, all things
                    conspire to increase the gloom,<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_113" n="113"></pb>and
                    assure us that nothing short of wisdom from on<br/>high will do for us to lean
                    to.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-06">6th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>My mind was deeply exercised with a
                    con-<br/>sideration, how the way may open in this dark land,<br/>to lift up our
                    testimony for the excellency of the<br/>government of Christ, our Redeemer, in
                    these hea-<br/>then regions of both white and red people. The<br/>Felicity is
                    just arrived from the Miami, and con-<br/>firms the account of the Indian
                    deputation being<br/>gone to meet the commissioners at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, accom-<br/>panied by <a href="/people/cbutl1">Col.
                            Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>.</p></div>

                    First of the week. Held a meeting in
                    the<br/>sail-loft, which was in a good degree comfortable<br/>and satisfactory.
                    Just arrived from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt.John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/dkenn1">David
                        Kennedy<persname key="dkenn1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/mohic">Mohican Samuel<persname key="mohic"></persname></a>,
                    by<br/> whom we received a letter from <a href="/people/haupa1">Capt.
                        Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>,<br/>importing, twenty nations were then assembled;
                    that<br/>there were runners sent to bring forward the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Poto-watomie<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> chiefs; that in a
                    few days, they should move<br/>to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>,
                    and that a desire for peace was gaining<br/>ground amongst them. This account,
                    from a man<br/>in whom we had confidence, was encouraging to us.</p>
<p> In the afternoon, we held a meeting for worship<br/>at a mill, at the <geogname key="rouger">river Ruzche</geogname>, about five miles from<br/><a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, with a considerable number of middle
                    aged<br/> and young people, to the peace of our minds. Re-<br/>turned in the
                    evening, they having sent up horses<br/>to bring us down and carry us back.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-08">8th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had an interview with <a href="/people/dkenn1">David Kennedy<persname key="dkenn1"></persname></a>, a<br/>learned, intelligent man, just returned
                    with <a href="/people/cjohn1">Capt.John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a> from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>. He informs, there are a nu-<br/>merous host
                    of Indians there, and that the general<br/>sentiments were looking towards
                    peace; yet the<br/>young <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> were high, and rough in their<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_114" n="114"></pb>dispositions, especially the warriors. We also
                    had<br/>an opportunity with about ten or twelve Indians of<br/>the Six Nations,
                    desiring them to use their influence<br/>to promote the work of peace; which
                    they appeared<br/>to unite with.</p>
<p> This forenoon we wrote to <a href="/people/haupa1">Capt. Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>
                    by<br/>Samuel, also sent him some money (five dollars) for<br/>which he wrote.
                    We have lately understood that<br/>hostilities have commenced between the
                        <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a><br/> and
                        <a href="/organizations/sioux">Sioux of the
                    Meadows<orgname key="sioux"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/sioux">Sioux of
                        the Woods<orgname key="sioux"></orgname></a>,<br/>against each other. They are powerful nations.</p>
<p> This day was another interment at the Roman<br/>chapel, of a man, said to be one
                    hundred and fifteen<br/>years old. It was, as usual, attended with
                    abundance<br/>of Romish pomp and superstition. The house was<br/>wonderfully
                    replenished with lighted candles, which,<br/>in meridian sunshine, appeared to
                    reflect no light at<br/> all; but rather a gloom — which is truly the case
                    with<br/>spiritual sunshine, or gospel light. It all appeared<br/>dark.</p></div>

                        Jacket<persname key="bljac1"></persname></a>, a chief warrior among the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Dela-wares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, who, it is said, was in
                    command at <a href="/people/gstcl1">GeneralSt. Clair<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>'s defeat. He
                    was dressed in scarlet, with<br/>gold tassels, and a laced hat. A brave,
                    masculine<br/> figure of a man. I spoke to him by an interpreter,<br/>letting
                    him know I was one of the people called<br/>Quakers, who were men of peace, and
                    that we were<br/>come to try to heal, and make peace. He replied,<br/>he had
                    heard of Quakers, and that they were harm-<br/>less people, and did not fight.
                    He was going to<br/><a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>; but had given
                    his opinion before he came<br/>away, and hoped matters would be settled.<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_115" n="115"></pb>We also had a visit to-day from several
                        <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>.<br/>One
                    of them was a middle-aged man, the most solid<br/>countenanced I had seen
                    amongst them. We spoke<br/>to him by an interpreter, and let him know who<br/>we
                    were, and what our views were in coming; and<br/>also our apprehensions of the
                    sincerity of the go-<br/>vernment, in the present embassy. With which
                    he<br/>appeared pleased, and said, he heartily wished we<br/>might get through
                    with the work of peace, that the<br/>young and active part of the Indian nations
                    might<br/>know what to do, as it concerned them most, as the<br/>old ones had
                    not long to live. He said he had heard<br/>of our people, that we did justly,
                    and did not fight,<br/>and that he was glad to be with us. After drinking<br/>a
                    glass or two of wine, he wished us well, and de-<br/>parted.</p>
<p> In my interview with <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, I was
                    pre-<br/>sented with a sketch of the <geogname key="niagf">great
                        falls</geogname>, curiously ta-<br/>ken by <a href="/people/cstee1">Capt.
                        Steel<persname key="cstee1"></persname></a>, who is an artist at such designs.<br/>I also had an
                    account to-day, from a man employed<br/>at the <a href="/places/grandp">Grand
                        Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>. It is nine miles over, and<br/>three bundles of seventy
                    pounds each, is the stipula-<br/>ted burden for each man to carry that distance.
                    But<br/> some will carry more, and ascend and descend two<br/>mountains on the
                    way. Two men carry the canoe<br/>on their shoulders, until the blood will run
                    down<br/>on green hands; but at length, the skin becomes<br/>hard as a bullock's
                    neck, accustomed to the yoke.</p>
<p>Thus they carry and row, over ninety carrying<br/>places, and as many creeks,
                    puddles, little lakes,<br/>and rivers, for more than one thousand miles
                    be-<br/>yond the <a href="/places/grandp">Grand Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>.</p></div>

<p><a href="/people/bljac1">Capt. Blue
                        Jacket<persname key="bljac1"></persname></a> came to see us. We had<br/>a friendly interview with him.
                    He is married to a <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_116" n="116"></pb>French merchant's
                    daughter, late of this place, now<br/>deceased. Two <a href="/organizations/cayuga">Cayugas<orgname key="cayuga"></orgname></a> also visited us. But
                    we<br/>painfully feel the want of suitable interpreters. —<br/>Many understand
                    their language; but our sentiments<br/>being generally peaceful, serious, and
                    religious, so<br/>opposite to those held by persons qualified to serve<br/>us,
                    that what they delivered, appeared to be with<br/>shame and reluctance. This put
                    it out of our power<br/>fully to relieve our minds. My mental powers
                    often<br/>centred in secret intercession to the Preparer of<br/>hearts, that the
                    travail of my spirit might be con-<br/>veyed through such aqueducts, to their
                    advantage<br/>and edification, as may best consist with his wisdom<br/>and
                    power. As our minds were bowed, and patient-<br/>ly waded under it, there
                    evidently appeared a seri-<br/>ousness at times to impress their countenances.
                    —<br/> Last evening we received a grateful letter from the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/moraind">Moravian Indians<orgname key="moraind"></orgname></a>.</p>
<p> We had interviews to-day with several Indians,<br/><a href="/organizations/munseeind">Munseys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, to some satis-<br/>faction.
                    They appeared pleased with our motives<br/>in coming. This afternoon, I visited
                    a young woman<br/>educated at <a href="/places/newpo">Newport<placename key="newpo"></placename></a>, Rhode
                    Island. Her father's<br/>name, <a href="/people/wfost1">William Foster<persname key="wfost1"></persname></a>.
                    She went from home, con-<br/>trary to her father's will, with one Molay, an
                    offi-<br/>cer in <a href="/people/gstcl1">St Clair<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>’s army. He was
                    killed in the defeat<br/>of <date when="1790">1790</date>, and she taken
                    prisoner by the Indians, who<br/>kept her eleven months. She then got off, and
                    has<br/>since lived in <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, and by her
                    conduct, evinced<br/>that she was not thankful enough for the many
                    mer-<br/>cies, and great deliverances wrought for her. Lat-<br/>terly she has
                    been taken with epileptic fits, of which<br/>she frequently has divers in a day.
                    The intervals of<br/>health are filled with bemoanings and cries for
                        mer-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_117" n="117"></pb>cy. Notwithstanding it
                    appeared to me to be the<br/>chastening hand of judgment laid upon her, yet
                    my<br/>sympathy was touched, to consider if she was my<br/>child, poor and quite
                    destitute of friends able to<br/>comfort her, how should I feel. Oh! saith my
                    soul,<br/>that the multiplied mournful instances recited in the<br/>catalogue of
                    rebellion and disobedience to parents,<br/>might have the happy effect to induce
                    young people,<br/>early to seek the kingdom of God, and his righteous-<br/>ness:
                    so would they be preserved out of snares, temp-<br/>tations, and beds of anguish
                    and sorrow, the sure<br/>rewards of sin and disobedience.</p></div>

<p>Dined at <gap></gap> Abbott’s, a Detroit
                    merchant,<br/> with all our company, except <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a>. Indian<br/>affairs was the topic. In the course of the
                    conver-<br/>sation, I felt some zeal for the testimony to arise;<br/>under which
                    I spoke plainly to divers points, and<br/>some persons present urged the
                    necessity of whip-<br/>ping, or further chastising the Indians, and the
                    im-<br/>possibility of effecting their reformation without it.</p></div>

<p>Went down the river four miles, and
                    paid<br/> three or four little visits to some friendly people.<br/>This
                    afternoon, a vessel arrived from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort
                    Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>,<br/>bringing accounts that the Indian deputation had
                    ar-<br/>rived there, and the commissioners were returned<br/>to <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>. Which accounts, with no way opening<br/>as
                    yet, to see the Indians at the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, and no
                    let-<br/>ters from <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, make our
                    situation here, sin-<br/>gularly trying.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-13">13th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>A small vessel arrived from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>,<br/>which brought letters from my wife,
                        <a href="/people/mmill2">M. Miller<persname key="mmill2"></persname></a>,<br/>brother J. L. and Jonathan
                    and <a href="/people/rdawe1">Rumford Dawes<persname key="rdawe1"></persname></a>,<br/>all fraught with love,
                    and instructive communication.<br/>This was a joyous feast to my mind, and as marrow<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_118" n="118"></pb> to my bones, ministering much
                    consolation and en-<br/>couragement, and animating with increasing
                    ferven-<br/>cy and dedication, to encounter the difficulties of
                    our<br/>wilderness journey, with the varied conflicts and<br/>perils attendant
                    thereon. We also received three<br/>general epistles, one from <a href="/people/jpemb1">James Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>, one<br/>from <a href="/people/jpemb2">John Pemberton<persname key="jpemb2"></persname></a>, and one from <a href="/people/hdrin1">Henry
                        Drink-er<persname key="hdrin1"></persname></a>, all dated about <date when="1793-06-06">6th of 6th
                        mo. 1793</date>, which were<br/>mutually comforting and strengthening, to
                    our little<br/>band. To find and feel the help, sympathy, and<br/>travail of the
                    spirits of our friends at home, was like<br/>the consecrating oil to each of us.
                    This vessel also<br/>brought a letter to us from <a href="/people/cpic">Col.
                        Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a>, announ-<br/>cing the arrival of the Indian deputation,
                    just as they<br/>were about to embark — the commissioners were re-<br/>quested
                    to return to <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>, to have a
                    short<br/>speech in the audience of <a href="/people/gsim">Gov. Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>.
                    As it was<br/>to be a short conference, they desired our further<br/>patience,
                    and hoped to see us in a few days. This<br/>intelligence, after five weeks
                    suspense, was not very<br/>pleasant.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-14">14th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>First of the week. Held a public
                    meeting<br/>for worship in the ship-yard, which was attended by<br/>a large
                    number of people, divers of whom are near-<br/>ly attached to us. It was a
                    solid, quiet season. But<br/>through ignorance of the divine principle,
                    through<br/> their inattention to it, and want of faith in it, truth,<br/>in
                    this Babylonish land, does not rise into that do-<br/>minion, as I have felt it
                    in some other places.</p>
<p>I had an opportunity of conversing with <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon
                        Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>'s wife, who seems an inoffensive woman. She<br/>had been
                    long a prisoner amongst the Indians. She<br/>gave an account of many of their
                    method of torture<br/>on their enemies. She says they used frequently<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_119" n="119"></pb> to speak of the Quakers in the nations,
                    as a people<br/>that did not go to war. <a href="/people/celli1">Capt.
                        Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a> has just ar-<br/>rived from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, but nothing further has yet<br/>transpired.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-15">15th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had an interview with <a href="/people/celli1">Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>; he appears<br/>much reserved. Our anxious state of
                    suspense con-<br/>tinues. Being apprehensive of the Indian embassy<br/>to the
                    commissioners, preventing the proposed trea-<br/>ty, we wrote to <a href="/people/amcke1">Col. McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>, also a short epistle to<br/>the Indians,
                    to be in readiness to forward by the first<br/>opportunity.</p>
<p>Here we observed a species of Indian slaves, call-<br/>ed <a href="/organizations/pawnee">Pawneys<orgname key="pawnee"></orgname></a>, or Punins, who are captives,
                    chiefly<br/>taken by the <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>, from the Suez, (<a href="/organizations/sioux">Sioux<orgname key="sioux"></orgname></a>) or<br/>Pawney nations. But it is
                    sorrowful to think, that<br/>in a British government so famed for liberty,
                    they,<br/>and a number of the African race, are held in bon-<br/>dage during
                    life.</p>
<p>This day, I walked out into the woods, a mile and<br/>a half; when my further
                    excursion was prevented<br/>by swamps, bogs, and marshes. In my route, I
                    found<br/>stones in divers places, such as are observed on the<br/>margin of the
                    lake. The land in general is almost<br/>sunk under water. My mind was strongly
                    impress-<br/>ed with a belief, that lakes <geogname key="lakeh">Huron</geogname>, <geogname key="lakst">St. Clair</geogname>, <geogname key="lakee">Erie</geogname>, and<br/><geogname key="lakem">Michigan</geogname> were once united, and the tens of thou-<br/>sands of
                    acres, of low adjacent land, were all over-<br/>flowed. By the breaking and
                    wearing away of the<br/><geogname key="niagf">great falls</geogname>, as
                    mentioned before, the water has lower-<br/>ed to the present surface: and as
                    cultivation increases,<br/>I have no doubt, the country will be improved by
                    a<br/>further diminution of the marvellous cataract. The<br/>progress of
                    population, at present, is obstructed, not<br/>only by the wet, unhealthy state
                    of the country, but<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_120" n="120"></pb>also by other
                    circumstances: viz. one-seventh of the<br/>whole country is reserved for the
                    crown, and one-<br/>seventh for the episcopal clergy: also by an
                    existing<br/>law of old Canada, all real estates, though sold seven<br/> times
                    in seven years, must be sold at the chapel door,<br/> mostly on first day
                    afternoon, one-ninth whereof<br/>goes to the Roman church. By this means,
                    some<br/>congregations, especially in Montreal and Quebec,<br/>have become
                    immensely rich, and enabled to carry<br/>on their idolatrous pomp and parade of
                    worship, so<br/>as to make the world wonder. But as light is rising,<br/>a
                    necessary reform is apprehended to be not far dis-<br/>tant.</p></div>

<p>
                    Had a solid interview with <a href="/people/celli1">Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, deputy<br/>agent of Indian affairs for the
                    British. He is pre-<br/>paring to return to the Indian council at the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>.<br/> We proposed to him, whether there would
                    be any<br/>impropriety in our going with him. To which he<br/>replied, as his
                    sentiment, that where the Indians<br/>were now assembled, was their own council
                    ground,<br/>and on a path that was not to be trod in, but by war-<br/>riors: and
                    therefore, it was his opinion, it would not<br/>be eligible to move that way at
                    present. We let<br/>him know our prospects were, that every assistance<br/>from
                    the British government, towards negociating a<br/>peace with the Indians, would
                    be afforded. He gave<br/>us to understand, the Indians were generally
                    acquaint-<br/>ed with our being here, and our views towards them,<br/>and hoped,
                    on the return of the Indian embassy,<br/>some way would open for our relief.
                    Finding no<br/>way to have an opportunity with them collectively,<br/>we
                    concluded to write again to the agent, <a href="/people/amcke1">McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>,<br/> and also to the Indians; which <a href="/people/celli1">Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a> assured us<br/>should be fully and fairly interpreted to
                    them. With<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_121" n="121"></pb>this we were for the
                    present obliged to rest satisfied,<br/>in our probationary tribulated allotment.
                    I can truly<br/>say, I travailed with many pangs to be delivered,<br/>with
                    breathings to Him who alone can help and in-<br/>terpose, when all human aid is
                    utterly unavailing.</p>
<p> It is wheat harvest; the grain is well filled; but in<br/>many places, it is
                    much injured by a kind of smut,<br/>or blast. The grain is as large as good
                    wheat, but<br/> appears of a dusky color; and being bruised, or cut<br/>in two,
                    the contents are like soot, black and dusty.<br/>Sometimes ten blasted ears for
                    one sound one. In<br/> divers instances, wheat fields are rendered
                    entirely<br/>useless. When one-half, or one-third, or even one-<br/>tenth, is
                    smutted wheat, it spoils the whole. The<br/>farmer is obliged to wash all his
                    wheat, through<br/>three or four waters, before it is fit for bread.</p></div>

<p>No admission being apparent into the
                    In-<br/>dian country, as the best expedient, we concluded<br/>to send by
                        <a href="/people/celli1">Capt. Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, Friends' Address,
                    accompa-<br/>nied by a short epistle of our own, to the Indians:<br/>also, a
                    letter to <a href="/people/amcke1">Col. McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>. We remain daily
                    ex-<br/>ercised in a patient, fervent travail, that the Supreme<br/>Controller
                    of events, may bring to pass his hidden<br/>purposes, according to his own
                    sacred determination,<br/>to the exaltation of his own great name, in
                    these<br/>dark regions of violence, murder, and licentiousness<br/>of almost
                    every kind. The awful language of the<br/>Most High to a backsliding people
                    formerly, has<br/>frequently impressed my mind, as applicable to
                    the<br/>inhabitants of these countries, with some few ex-<br/>ceptions, “My soul
                    loathed them, and their souls<br/>abhorred me.”</p>
<p>This day a cannon was fired, for the direction of a<br/>man supposed to be lost
                    in the woods. It frequent-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_122" n="122"></pb>ly
                    happens, that people get bewildered in this coun-<br/>try, and sometimes lost,
                    especially in cloudy wea-<br/>ther. If they go but one mile in the woods, such
                    is<br/>the sameness of soil, timber, &amp;c. with no mountains,<br/>and few
                    streams to guide them, they frequently take<br/>the opposite direction from the
                    settlement, and get<br/>into difficulty.</p>
<p>We have lately heard of the arrival of a number<br/>of <a href="/organizations/creek">Creek<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/cherokee">cherokee Indians<orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a>, in the
                    neighbour-<br/>hood of the Indian council; we fear, with views not<br/>friendly
                    to a peaceable accommodation of matters<br/>with the western Indians. We have
                    heard, hostili-<br/>ties between them and the whites, have been renew-<br/>ed to
                    the southward. Great is the opposition, at<br/>present, in the earth, to the
                    peaceable kingdom of<br/> Christ, our Redeemer. Under a sense of which,
                    my<br/>spirit bows with intercession, that Israel may abide<br/>in their tents,
                    where they will be covered, as under<br/>the hollow of his divine hand, until
                    his indignation<br/>pass over.</p></div>

<p>
                    I had an interview with <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. George Wel-bank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a>, who appeared an
                    intelligent, cool, dispassion-<br/>ate man. He came with a detachment of
                        <a href="/organizations/cherokee">Cherokee<orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a><br/>and
                    <a href="/organizations/creek">Creek Indians<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a>, from
                    their towns in the southern<br/>territory, he says, more than a thousand miles
                    from<br/> hence in a straight line; and that they were ninety<br/>days on their
                    journey. His principal business ap-<br/>peared to be with <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, who immediately<br/>gave orders for the sloop
                    Felicity to sail, with <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt.Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a> on
                    board, to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, on the way to <a href="/people/gsim">Gov. Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>. Large rolls of intelligence were
                    despatched<br/>by him, containing, as we supposed, matters of im-<br/>portance.
                    Shortly before, <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a> assured
                    our<br/>friends, the Felicity was detained in the harbor on <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_123" n="123"></pb> purpose to transport us to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, or <a href="/places/ferie">Fort
                        Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>,<br/>as was most eligible on the shortest notice.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a>, on the
                    situ-<br/>ation of Indian affairs to the southward, with which<br/>he discovered
                    extensive knowledge, he asserted as<br/>follows: — That in the year <date when="1791">1791</date>, a treaty was held<br/>with the southern Indians,
                    negociated on behalf of<br/>the United States, by a person who made out
                    the<br/>articles of the treaty in writing, wherein he inserted<br/>the free
                    navigation of the <geogname key="tenne">Cherokee river</geogname>,
                    without<br/>their knowledge, and bribed the interpreter to read,<br/>ten miles
                    round <a href="/places/nashv">Nashville<placename key="nashv"></placename></a> village, where forty was<br/>
                    inserted. There was a large extent of country, for<br/>which the natives
                    required three thousand dollars<br/>per annum, but he assured them his power
                    would<br/>not permit him to go so high; but for the present,<br/>he would insure
                    two thousand dollars, and had no<br/>doubt of obtaining the whole sum, by an
                    application<br/>to Congress. But in the article it was read, two<br/>thousand
                    dollars, where one thousand only was en-<br/>tered. And after all, the survey
                    far exceeded the<br/>limits of the land agreed on. Of which grievances,<br/>the
                    bloody fellow, <a href="/people/notaw1">Notawasky<persname key="notaw1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jober1">Joberson<persname key="jober1"></persname></a>, and Prince<br/>of Eastern Airy, came to
                    Congress for redress; they<br/>were politely received, and assured justice
                    should<br/> take place. On the faith of which, they returned,<br/>and made
                    report to their people, who rested satisfied,<br/>until their hopes of redress
                    were laid waste, by Spen-<br/>cer and others
                    coming over the dividing ridge, be-<br/>tween <geogname key="holst">Holstein</geogname> and <geogname key="tenne">Tennessee rivers</geogname>,
                    (which was the<br/>boundary prescribed) building mills, and piqueting<br/>forts,
                    on the waters of the <geogname key="tenne">Tennessee</geogname>. <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. Wel-bank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a> says, the Indians have applied
                    to the Spaniards,<br/>and received assurances they shall be supplied with
                        <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_124" n="124"></pb> necessaries. There were some
                    reasons for believing<br/><a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a> was
                    now here, to negociate a friend-<br/>ship with the British.</p>
<p>This afternoon, <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> and myself,
                    walked<br/>three or four miles, to see sixteen <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>,<br/> amongst whom are
                    several principal men, <a href="/people/gduck1">GeorgeDuckwell<persname key="gduck1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="/people/ab">Abram<persname key="ab"></persname></a>, &amp;c. We had some conversation<br/>
                    with them on the advantages of peace, and the bless-<br/>ings consequent on
                    being redeemed out of the spirit<br/>of war. We also entered a little into the
                    subjects<br/> of the existing uneasiness between the Indians and<br/>our
                    government. <a href="/people/gduck1">Duckwell<persname key="gduck1"></persname></a>, an old man, said,
                    the<br/>dispute was about lands west of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> — that he<br/>was at a treaty, held at <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, twenty-four<br/>years ago, which was a
                    general treaty with all the<br/>tribes; and then, the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> was agreed to be the<br/>boundary. Since which time, he
                    knew of no treaty,<br/>where the chiefs who had a right to sell lands,
                    were<br/>collected. I find the Six Nations claim a kind of<br/>sovereignty over
                    the soil, to a great extent south-<br/>ward. <a href="/people/ab">Abram<persname key="ab"></persname></a>
                    said, he married his wife amongst the<br/><a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and some years ago, they made a
                    visit<br/>to see her relations, "and I say, brothers, what you<br/>always go to
                    war — fight 'mericas? They say — if<br/>'mericas love peace, give us our lands —
                    stay that<br/> side 'hio — shake hands — call brothers; — but if ‘me-<br/>ricas
                    come take our country, where deer plenty,<br/>turkeys, wild cows — good land —
                    then war — always<br/> war." We told him, we never went to war, nor<br/>our
                    friends, for one hundred and fifty years past —<br/>that all men, of all
                    nations, white, red, and black,<br/>were our brothers — that one Great Spirit
                    made us<br/>all, and was father of us all. They said, Ouch, that<br/>is good,
                    very good.</p></div>

<p>Staid mostly at our lodgings, writing,
                    and<br/>conversing with some intelligent travellers. One<br/>of them related a
                    conversation between one <a href="/people/frobi1">Frobish-er<persname key="frobi1"></persname></a>, a
                    merchant in the north-west trade, when at the<br/><a href="/places/grandp">Grand
                        Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>, west end of <geogname key="lakes">Lake
                        Superior</geogname>, and an<br/>old Indian from the north-west; which so
                    much co-<br/>incided with my own sentiments, that I note it.<br/><a href="/people/frobi1">Frobisher<persname key="frobi1"></persname></a> was inquiring after the curiosities of
                    the<br/> northern clime, which the Indian related as far as<br/>he had travelled
                    — but added, that younger Indians,<br/>who had travelled further north-west, had
                    seen some<br/>things still more wonderful. <a href="/people/frobi1">Frobisher<persname key="frobi1"></persname></a> asked him,<br/>if he did not think some parts of their
                    relation un-<br/>true? The old Indian replied, no; it is not possible<br/>it can
                    be lies, for they had never seen a white man<br/>in their lives! A severe
                    reflection on Christians, so<br/>called.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-20">20th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>A woman was interred at the Roman
                    cha-<br/>pel, with the usual pomp, parade, and superstition.<br/>Candles burning
                    in clear sunshine — host and holy<br/>water displayed — black pall surplices.
                    All the males<br/> bare-headed, walking slowly — the sexton going be-<br/>fore,
                    the host-bearer next, with a boy on each side,<br/>carrying lighted candles.
                    Then the priest, in his<br/> pontifical robes, with a boy before him, with a
                    brass<br/>laver or font, containing the consecrated water, with<br/>a brush in
                    it. On each side of the priest were sing-<br/>ers, dolefully humming Latin. The
                    priest held a<br/>book in his hand, which he sometimes opened, and<br/>then sung
                    Latin — several times sprinkling the bier<br/>and pall with the water. The
                    singers and boys bear-<br/>ing the candlesticks and laver, as also those
                    who<br/>supported the bier, were clothed outside with black.<br/>The bells rung
                    frequently. Indeed, the whole pro-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_126" n="126"></pb>
                    cession appeared solemnly dark. When they came<br/>to the grave, which was about
                    two and a half feet<br/>deep, in which was much water, the priest took
                    the<br/>brush, and added a little more — they laid down the<br/>coffin, and for
                    a time dolefully hummed more Latin.<br/>During which, the people generally went
                    on their<br/>knees. When that was over, the people departed,<br/>leaving the
                    sexton to fill up the grave alone. I am<br/>told the water rises so near the
                    surface of the ground<br/>in these countries, that it is difficult to bury a
                    corpse<br/>so deep, but what the wolves can scratch down to<br/> it. As they
                    often bury without coffins, many who<br/>are killed in battle in the woods, and
                    others murder-<br/>ed in cold blood and left above ground, the wolves<br/>have
                    devoured them. It is said, these animals have<br/>become so fierce and fond of
                    human flesh, that they<br/>have attacked, and destroyed people in the
                    woods.<br/>The Indians used to call them brothers, and would<br/>not kill them;
                    but one or two of their people having<br/>been killed by those creatures, the
                    Indians have<br/>now proclaimed war against them, killing all they<br/>can.</p>
<p> This low, level country, abounds with sugar-trees<br/>to such a degree, that if
                    the manufactory of sugar<br/>was promoted extensively in this place, it might
                    be<br/>ranked among the exports of North America. The<br/>Indians, who have
                    kettles suitable for the business,<br/>make large quantities in the spring of
                    the year, and<br/>sell it as low as six-pence per pound, and under.<br/>Some
                    have been so fraudulent, as to mix sand with<br/>it, and when detected,
                    endeavoured to justify them-<br/>selves, by the example of the white people
                    mixing<br/>water with the rum, sold to them. A practice, very<br/>common amongst
                    the rum sellers, who say, rum<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_127" n="127"></pb> hurts
                    them, and the less they get the better for them.<br/>It is, therefore, evident,
                    that in proportion to their<br/>intercourse with the whites, they have increased
                    in<br/>treachery, fraud, drunkenness, and licentiousness of<br/>every kind; and
                    appear, at present, not unlikely to<br/>be a rod prepared for our close
                    chastisement.</p>
<p>Being in their nature, or by habit, unfeeling and<br/>ferocious, I have often in
                    this journey, had my feel-<br/>ings wounded, by seeing old gray-headed
                    women,<br/>carrying heavy burdens of skins, venison, brooms,<br/>matchcoats,
                    &amp;c. with large drops of sweat rolling<br/>from their aged brows; when
                    several sprightly young<br/> and middle-aged men, went lightly on before
                    them,<br/>with nothing to carry but their clothes, tomahawk,<br/>and scalping
                    knife, dangling by their thigh.</p></div>

<p>Last evening, I had an account from a
                    man<br/> who came from the Glades up the <geogname key="miamr">Miami-of-the-lake</geogname>,<br/>that the <a href="/organizations/creek">Creek<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/cherokee">Cherokee Indians<orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a> passed through<br/>the
                        <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> towns
                    there, and produced a piece of<br/>tobacco died red, which was received as the
                    decla-<br/>ration of war against the United States — that the<br/>white
                    prisoners were very numerous amongst the<br/>Indians — and that, at the Rapids,
                    as he came along,<br/> he saw a beautiful woman, well dressed, just
                    brought<br/>in.</p>
<p>This morning, a number of <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida
                        Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> came<br/>to our lodgings, and informed, that two of
                    their<br/> number had just come from the Rapids, and brought<br/>tidings, that
                    it was reported there, that Wayne's<br/>army was advancing, and large numbers of
                    the In-<br/>dians had left the Council, to go to defend their<br/>towns. They
                    sent to the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> to
                    repair to their<br/>assistance, which they were resolved not to comply<br/>with.
                    Which determination, we endeavored to<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_128" n="128"></pb> strengthen, and gave it as our opinion, that the army<br/>was not advancing,
                    and would not advance, until<br/>the result of the treaty was known. They
                    were<br/>very jealous of some deception, which it was hard<br/>to remove.</p>
<p> This forenoon, had a solid meeting in the ship-<br/>yard; after which, a number
                    of the gentlemen of the<br/>town came to see us. In a little time, one
                    came,<br/>who announced the Dunmore was at the mouth of<br/>the river, with the
                    commissioners on board. Soon<br/> after, <a href="/people/cgibs">Capt.
                        Gibbons<persname key="cgibs"></persname></a>, who was a passenger, came<br/>and confirmed the news. We
                    had appointed a meet-<br/>ing at five o'clock, and thought best to
                    endeavour<br/>for stillness at present. The afternoon meeting was<br/>not so
                    large as the former. It was a season of heavy<br/>exercise, through the
                    prevalence of a carnal, luke-<br/>warm disposition, in many; yet the great
                    Shepherd<br/>was mercifully pleased to baptize a remnant into<br/>tenderness of
                    spirit; and the opportunity concluded<br/>with solemn supplication.</p>
<p> In the evening, we had a visit from <a href="/people/cgibs">____
                        Gibbons<persname key="cgibs"></persname></a>,<br/>an officer in the regiment of Queen's Rangers.
                    He<br/>was present when the Indians opened their embassy<br/>to the
                    commissioners, at <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>. About
                    ninety<br/>Indians were there. When the governor, <a href="/people/gsim">Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>,<br/>was present, <a href="/people/cbran1">Capt.
                        Brant<persname key="cbran1"></persname></a> spoke as follows: “Gen-<br/>tlemen, you say you are
                    commissioners from the<br/>United States; have you power to alter the
                    disputed<br/>line between you and us?" They answered, "We<br/>have." "Can you
                    tell us the reason of an armed<br/>force advancing at this time into our
                    country?" The<br/>answer was, "We cannot, neither do we believe it;<br/>yet to
                    make all parties satisfied, we will despatch an<br/>express immediately to the
                    war office, to stop every<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_129" n="129"></pb>motion of
                    an advance.” Then they said, "Come<br/>on, we will treat with you.” <a href="/people/jparr2">Jasper Parrish<persname key="jparr2"></persname></a> was<br/>despatched to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>The commissioners not being permitted to come<br/>here, were landed at the mouth
                    of the river, and<br/>have sent for us.</p></div>

<p>Settled with our landlord, <a href="/people/mdols">Matthew Dolson<persname key="mdols"></persname></a>,<br/>for six weeks accommodation,
                    twelve pounds, seven<br/>shillings, and six-pence, York money.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-23">23rd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>I visited <a href="/people/cengl1">Col.
                        England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, in company with<br/><a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, to confer with him, on the most eligi-<br/>ble mode of
                    departure from <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. He, with
                    his<br/>wonted politeness, offered his barge; but gave it as<br/>his sentiment,
                    that we had better stay till fifth-day,<br/>when the Dunmore would sail, to be
                    at the commis-<br/>sioners' direction. As it was his orders, it was also<br/>his
                    inclination, to accommodate them, all in his<br/>power, we consented to add two
                    days more to our<br/> confinement.</p>
<p> We had an interview with several Indians to-day;<br/>one of them acknowledged he
                    had killed a Kuhemo-<br/>comon, and stole three horses this spring. He was<br/>a
                    warlike creature, and we could do little with him,<br/>for want of an
                    interpreter. I gave him a few hints,<br/>a pipe, and a loaf of bread, and he
                    departed.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-24">24th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>A solemn morning; my mind composed,<br/>and
                    engaged in mental aspirations to the Supreme<br/>Controller of events, that he
                    might be pleased to<br/>bless our endeavours to promote the glory and
                    ho-<br/>nour of his own great name, the advantage of our<br/>country, the peace
                    of nations, and of individuals. —<br/>In which I beheld, that so long as we
                    dwelt only on<br/>the surface, and superficies of important subjects, in<br/>a
                    chain of carnal reasoning, and in the fogs and mists<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_130" n="130"></pb>of earthly wisdom and human policy, we are in
                    dan-<br/>ger of making errors in judgment, and of viewing<br/>the agents of
                    distress, as the primary cause of evil.<br/>But by tracing effects to their
                    causes, and weighing<br/> actions in the equal and unalterable scales of
                    justice<br/>and truth, I believe we shall centre in prospect with<br/>the
                    inspired penman, “Affliction cometh not forth<br/> of the dust, neither doth
                    trouble spring out of the<br/>ground." Is there not a cause? Consider,
                    yea,<br/>awfully contemplate the announced decree of Him<br/>"who weigheth the
                    mountains in scales, and the<br/>hills in a balance, and meteth out the heavens
                    with<br/>a span, and measureth the water of the seas in the<br/>hollow of his
                    hand; and before whom, all nations<br/>are but as the drop of a bucket," — "Such
                    measure<br/>as ye mete, to you it shall be measured again."</p>
<p> When I view the dreadful scenes of barbarity, at-<br/>tendant on the African
                    slave trade, and its train of<br/>concurrent circumstances, my soul is almost
                    over-<br/>whelmed with discouragement. Judgment is the<br/>Lord's, and he surely
                    will repay. Have the Indians<br/>burned houses; murdered men, women, and
                    chil-<br/>dren; betrayed their friends; carried away into cap-<br/>tivity and
                    bondage, old and young, male and female;<br/>and cruelly burned and tortured
                    others; lurked pri-<br/>vily for prey; shot down men at their ploughs,
                    and<br/>travellers on the road? Yea, they have; until the<br/> rehearsal of many
                    of their horrid scenes of barbar-<br/>ity, has agitated, shocked, and almost
                    convulsed<br/>every nerve.</p>
<p> But what shall I say? How are my feeling<br/>wounded, on being constrained to
                    contrast these<br/>reproaches to humanity, with the conduct of civi-<br/>lized,
                    professing Christian nations? In which I la-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_131" n="131"></pb>ment, our own government (in most respects,
                    super-<br/>latively excellent) is obliged to take a share. Ves-<br/>sels fitted
                    out, commanded by men, with hearts cal-<br/>lous to the feelings of humanity,
                    and deaf to her<br/>cries — which repair to the African coast, stir up<br/>war,
                    burn towns, kill, catch, and carry captive, in-<br/>discriminately, these poor,
                    and, as to them, altoge-<br/>ther unoffending people — bring them to distant
                    and<br/> different cities and towns, ringing with alarms for<br/>worship,
                    sounding with hymns and psalms from<br/>stately temples, where they offer their
                    devotion to<br/>the universal Parent, who hath revealed his will in<br/>the
                    language of "do justly, love mercy, and walk<br/>humbly with thy God" —
                    professing to believe in<br/>the Divine Lawgiver, whose statute is,
                    "Whatso-<br/>ever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye<br/>even so unto
                    them." Instead whereof, they are sold<br/>like beasts, at market; separated,
                    husband from wife,<br/>children from parents; without regard to the
                    tender-<br/>est ties of natural affection: often put under unfeel-<br/>ing
                    whippers, and cruel taskmasters, where they are<br/>frequently starved, or whipt
                    to death — and if they<br/>run away, and are caught, they have been hung
                    up<br/>without trial or jury. Some who had procured their<br/>liberty, have been
                    hunted with horses and dogs, and<br/> shot down. While such enormities are in
                    the land,<br/>and winked at by the rulers, shall we not lay our<br/>mouths in
                    the dust, with this language impressed on<br/>our minds, "O Lord! just, and
                    true, and righteous,<br/>are thy judgments." I cannot omit remarking the<br/>joy
                    we feel, at the escape of a captive white, from<br/>among the Indians; yet, what
                    a stir when a negro<br/>slave attempts his liberty! advertisements printed,<br/>
                    and rewards offered to take him, alive or dead.</p>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_132" n="132"></pb>
<p> This afternoon, had a visit from <a href="/people/fbaub1">Fransey
                        Baubee<persname key="fbaub1"></persname></a>,<br/>just returned from the assembly of Upper
                    Canada,<br/>where the subjecet of slavery was closely debated.<br/><a href="/people/gsim">Gov. Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a> appeared an advocate on the side of<br/>
                    liberty. But so strong was the opposition from mo-<br/>tives of interest, they
                    could carry the subject no fur-<br/>ther, than liberty at twenty-five years of
                    age, to all<br/>born after this date. Which account increased my<br/>exercise
                    for the lamentable state of mankind. Blood<br/>touching blood, mingled with
                    tears of the oppressed,<br/>whose groans ascend to the ears of the Lord of
                    Sa-<br/>baoth. While others live on their labours, in volup-<br/>tuousness,
                    ease, and pride, spending days and nights<br/>in revelling, feasting, fiddling,
                    dancing, drunkenness,<br/>debauchery, and abominable conversation. On
                    which<br/>account, I do believe, the earth and its inhabitants<br/>will be made
                    to tremble, and the ears of many be<br/>made to tingle.</p></div>

<p>Took an affiectionate leave of <a href="/people/mdols">Matthew Dol-son<persname key="mdols"></persname></a> and Hannah, and divers other
                    inhabitants of <a href="/places/detro">De-troit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, and went on
                    board the Dunmore; <a href="/people/cengl1">Col. England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/lhenr1">Lieut. Henry<persname key="lhenr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/eross1">Ensign

                    accompanying us. Many of the officers of the gar-<br/>rison, and inhabitants of
                    the place, came to the wharf,<br/>to take leave of us. Among the latter, is a
                    very re-<br/>spectable family, of the name of Reynolds. They<br/>have an amiable
                    daughter, <a href="/people/mreyn1">Margaret<persname key="mreyn1"></persname></a>. We proceeded<br/>down the
                    river, and at one o'clock, arrived at <a href="/people/celli1">Capt.
                        Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>'s house, at the mouth of it. Landed in the<br/>colonel’s
                    barge, and were gladly received by the<br/>commissioners, after about eight
                    weeks absence: the<br/>joy was mutual. <a href="/people/cbunb1">Capt.
                        Banbury<persname key="cbunb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/ichap2">Gen. Cheaping<persname key="ichap2"></persname></a>,<br/>and
                        <a href="/people/lgive1">Lieut. Givenz<persname key="lgive1"></persname></a> were there. They

<p>Walked down the river, one mile and
                    a<br/>half, to <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>'s, a great
                    white-man-chief<br/>among the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>. He was not at home. Re-<br/>turned, and had some

                        Cheaping<persname key="ichap2"></persname></a>, on Indian affairs; also concerning<br/>women's
                    preaching. He appears to be a judicious<br/>man in most respects.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-27">27th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Had a solid conversation with <a href="/people/grand1">Gov. Ran-dolph<persname key="grand1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cford1">Capt.

                    army, —<br/>on slavery, war, swearing, and debauchery. When<br/>men are closely
                    pinched, I find their nearest way to<br/>get rid of a difficulty, is a denial of
                    the Scriptures,<br/>turn Deists, and explain away the weighty parts of<br/>the
                    moral law.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-28">28th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>First-day. Walked three miles, and were<br/>
                    paddled about three miles more in a canoe, by two<br/>Indians, to a meeting we
                    had appointed on the<br/>Island of <a href="/places/gisle">Grosseel<placename key="gisle"></placename></a>,
                    where fifty or sixty people col-<br/>lected, who behaved with solid gravity. We
                    were<br/>favoured to feel an evidence of the simplicity, purity,<br/>and
                    spirituality of the gospel dispensation, which I<br/>hope was preached to them
                    in the pure disinterested<br/>love thereof. We returned with peaceful minds
                    and<br/>thankful hearts. After meeting, a woman said, she<br/>blushed to tell
                    me, that the preceding evening, she<br/>joined with others, in condemning us as
                    wolves in<br/> sheep's clothing; but she was now fully convinced,<br/>that what
                    she had been seeking abroad amongst forms<br/>and shadows, was to be found at
                    home in her own<br/>heart; and hoped to retain a thankful remembrance<br/>of the
                    mercy vouchsafed to her that day: adding,<br/>she did not lament her troubles
                    and exercises, which<br/>were great, seeing they had, at length, brought
                    her<br/>to the discovery of the way of life. Many others,<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_134" n="134"></pb> I believe, were reached this day. Yet my joy
                    was<br/>not of long continuance; for about eight o'clock in<br/>the evening,
                    some of our jolly fellow-travellers, pro-<br/>moted an Indian dance, in which
                    they joined. The<br/>Indians were about twenty in number, with several<br/>white
                    men in the ring, and a candle in the centre.<br/>Round and round they danced,
                    with ungrateful grunt-<br/>ing, barking, and at intervals, screaming and
                    hollow-<br/>ing — the war dance, the peace dance, the scalping<br/>dance,
                    &amp;c. which they continued till near midnight,<br/>frequently regaling
                    themselves with spirits. This<br/>conduct, considering the solemn importance of
                    our<br/>business, proved very exercising to my mind, and<br/>almost overwhelmed
                    me with discouragement.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-29">29th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>I felt heavy, and sorrowful, on
                    account<br/>of the last evening's conduct, which I suggested to<br/>some of our
                    leading gentlemen. I also testified my<br/>disapprobation of such conduct, to
                    the Indians; in<br/>which I was joined by a squaw, whose husband, by<br/>way of
                    apology, told me, white men promoted it,<br/>and joined them in it. This I was
                    constrained to<br/>admit, however degrading. So that upon the
                    whole,<br/>contrasting Indians and whites, of all nations, upon<br/>the broad
                    scale, our superiority appears but imag0-<br/>nary, and does not exist.</p>
<p>About five o'clock this afternoon, arrived <a href="/people/celli1">Capt.
                        Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/tmcke1">Capt. McKee<persname key="tmcke1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>, and one Smith,<br/>with <a href="/people/ocoho1">Ocohongehelas<persname key="ocoho1"></persname></a>, the great <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> war chief,<br/>and about twenty
                    other Indians from <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>. The<br/>Indians
                    encamped opposite to us, on Bay’s Long<br/>Island. The white men came over to
                    us, and in-<br/>formed, that the Indians were much dissatisfied, on<br/>the
                    report of their deputation to the commissioners<br/>at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>; and had sent their second embassy, ex-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_135" n="135"></pb>plicitly to declare their intentions in writing,
                    signed<br/>by ten nations. This is to be presented to-morrow,<br/>and it is
                    apprehended will determine the business.</p></div>

<p>A deputation of twenty-five Indians,
                    came<br/>over the river about nine o'clock; when seated, the<br/>commissioners
                    seated before them, and we forming<br/>an angle at the Indians' right hand,
                    after a solemn<br/>pause, an Indian inquired, "Are you ready?" <a href="/people/sgirt1">Si-mon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>was told to answer, yes. Then a
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wy-andot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> chief
                    arose, took off his hat, and thanked the<br/>Great Spirit, they had met; and
                    spoke some time,<br/>introductory to the delivery of a written
                    message:<br/>wherein they state, that matters were not fully ex-<br/>plained at
                        <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>; therefore they explicitly
                    require<br/>an answer, whether the commissioners have power<br/>to make
                        <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> the boundary; and if so,
                    immediately<br/> to remove all the inhabitants off the land, west of<br/>the
                    Ohio? To which, <a href="/people/glinc1">Gen. Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a> (after all
                    three<br/> had read it, and consulted together) answered, they<br/>would inform
                    them to-morrow. After this, we had<br/>a solid conference with the
                    commissioners, on the<br/>obstacles thrown in the way, and they explained
                        the<br/><a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a> conference; which we
                    approved as fair and<br/>candid. This demand appeared a new matter,
                    pro-<br/>bably suggested by some designing enemy to peace.<br/>The letter was
                    signed by ten nations, viz. <a href="/organizations/delaware">Dela-wares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/ottawa">Ottawas<orgname key="ottawa"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/mingo">Min-goes<orgname key="mingo"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Munseys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>, &amp;c.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-31">31st</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>About nine o'clock, the Indians came
                    over<br/> the river, among whom, <a href="/people/ocoho1">Ocohongehelas<persname key="ocoho1"></persname></a>, the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Dela-ware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> war chief, his brother, and <a href="/people/ljonn1">Little Jonny<persname key="ljonn1"></persname></a>, a<br/>
<a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> chief, and
                        <a href="/people/carry1">Carry-all-about<persname key="carry1"></persname></a>, a <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a><br/>chief, were principal men. We
                    spoke to them, and<br/>told them we were their brothers, the Quakers,
                        come<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_136" n="136"></pb> from <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, to see them. They showed joy<br/>in their
                    countenances, and shook hands very affec-<br/>tionately. They told us their
                    chiefs, who knew us,<br/>were almost all dead. We answered them, our
                    fa-<br/>thers who were acquainted with our Indian brothers,<br/>were likewise
                    mostly fallen asleep; but notwith-<br/>standing, we their children, possessed
                    the same love<br/>and friendship for the Indians, as our fathers did;<br/>and
                    wished it to continue to the end of time. They<br/>were very solid, and their
                    countenances marked<br/>with the weight and importance of the business.
                    We<br/>smoked with them; but perceiving their minds un-<br/>der such pressure
                    and exercise, we did not talk much.<br/>They told us, through <a href="/people/sgirt1">Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>, that they could not<br/>now say much; but
                    would, after they got their an-<br/>swer. They staid about two hours, and
                    received no-<br/>tice from the commissioners, that about five o'clock<br/>in the
                    afternoon, they should have an answer to the<br/>embassy. Then they returned to
                    the island.</p>
<p>This forenoon, four British officers came down<br/>from the garrison; <a href="/people/jcraw1">Crawford<persname key="jcraw1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cvand1">Vandeleur<persname key="cvand1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/eross1">Ross<persname key="eross1"></persname></a>,
                        and<br/>Eddy — also, <a href="/people/cthom1">Capt. Thomas<persname key="cthom1"></persname></a>, McGee, <a href="/people/fbaub1">Baubee<persname key="fbaub1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/cbunb1">Bun-berry<persname key="cbunb1"></persname></a>, and
                        <a href="/people/lgive1">Givenz<persname key="lgive1"></persname></a>. <a href="/people/ccald1">Capt.
                        Caldwell<persname key="ccald1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/tsmit2">ThomasSmith<persname key="tsmit2"></persname></a>,
                    dined with us, and waited the return of the<br/>Indian deputation. About five
                    o'clock, the Indians<br/>came. About six, the commissioners came out. —<br/>
<a href="/people/cpic">Col. Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a> politely addressed them; then
                    read,<br/>and <a href="/people/tjone1">Thomas Jones<persname key="tjone1"></persname></a> interpreted it into
                    Seneca, in<br/>substance — beginning at the treaty of <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>,<br/>twenty-five years ago, and recited the terms,
                        that<br/><geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> was then, concluded to be the
                    boundary.—<br/>Then recited subsequent treaties, beginning at <a href="/places/fstan">FortStanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, about nine years ago, and one held
                    ninety<br/>days after, at one place, another, at another, until<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_137" n="137"></pb> he mentioned four different places, and the
                    proceed-<br/>ings of each. That in consequence of these treaties,<br/>the United
                    States had sold large tracts of land, which<br/>were now settled, and largely
                    improved, on the north<br/>west side of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>. Therefore, impossible now<br/>to make it the boundary: and
                    that, in order to come<br/>to a peace, and to understand each other
                    perfectly,<br/> by writing, was not the way. Which new mode<br/>they had
                    adopted, contrary to all former precedents.<br/>But he explicitly declared, the
                    United States wished<br/>for peace, on the most just and unequivocal terms.<br/>
                    Which, as the Indians demanded, and no better way<br/>opened, were inserted —
                    viz. That what the United<br/>States wished for, was, to have all the lands
                    ceded<br/>by the treaty at <a href="/places/fharm">Fort Harmer<placename key="fharm"></placename></a>,
                    confirmed; and a<br/>small piece at the <geogname key="ohiof">Falls of
                        Ohio</geogname>, for <a href="/people/gclar1">Gen. Clarke<persname key="gclar1"></persname></a><br/> and
                    his warriors. And, if all that land could not<br/>be given up, they were
                    commissioned to draw a<br/>new boundary, as might be agreed upon in
                    general<br/>council, if that could be obtained; for which, they<br/>would
                    advance more money than ever had been ad-<br/>vanced, at any one treaty, as a
                    purchase for Indian<br/>lands, with much goods: in addition to which,
                    they<br/>would engage to pay an annual subsidy in goods,<br/>accommodated to
                    their wants, equal to what they<br/>annually procured off the lands, by skins
                    and peltry.<br/>And further, as formerly, some improper ideas had<br/>been held
                    up, td their uneasiness, that in conse-<br/>quence of the right of pre-emption,
                    given up by the<br/>king of Great Britain, and lately confirmed by
                    Lord<br/>Dorchester, we considered all the lands east and<br/>south of the
                        <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname> and the Lakes, the
                    proper-<br/>ty of the United States, without regard to Indian<br/>claims. Which
                    right, or pretension of right, we<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_138" n="138"></pb>
                    publicly disclaimed, until fair purchase was made<br/>of the Indian owners; and
                    this right of purchase,<br/>belonged to the United States only. That
                    these<br/>were the leading traits of their commission. This<br/>was read by
                        <a href="/people/cpic">Col. Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a>, and interpreted into<br/>the
                        <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> tongue by
                        <a href="/people/tjone1">Thomas Jones<persname key="tjone1"></persname></a>. It concluded<br/>about dark;
                    when the paper, containing the above<br/>sentiments, was delivered to the old
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>
                    chief,<br/>the English of whose name is,<persname key="carry1"><emph rend="italics">King of all the
                        Na-<br/>tions</emph></persname>, who said, they would reply to it
                    to-morrow<br/>afternoon. They then departed to their camp, and<br/>we to our
                    tents. It was a cool night; but the exer-<br/>cise of my mind, arising from the
                    importance of<br/>the business, was such, that I could hardly forbear<br/>
                    trembling. The countenances of the Indians, were<br/> so sedate, solid, and
                    determined, that notwithstand-<br/>ing the propositions held out, appeared to be
                    liberal,<br/> and well adapted to the happiness of the Indians,<br/> yet, such
                    was their jealousy, and want of faith in<br/> our government, that I was afraid
                    they would not<br/> take. Which apprehensions, with the screams and<br/> hollows
                    of an Indian dance, near our tents, inter-<br/>rupted my repose for hours.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-01">1st of 8th mo</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>I awoke about day-break; soon<br/>
                    after, I heard ten reports of a rifle, one after ano-<br/>ther, in the Indian
                    camp; which was one for each<br/> nation that had signed the written Indian
                    embassy,<br/> from the council at the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>.
                    About eight o’clock,<br/> fifteen of them came over, and informed, they
                    were<br/>prepared to speak to the commissioners; who soon<br/>seated themselves:
                    when the old king who spoke be-<br/>fore, said, <said who="carry1">Brothers, we want to be at
                    peace with<br/>you; but you tell us you have had treaties there,<br/>and there,
                    and there, and purchased lands on this<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_139" n="139"></pb> side the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>: but there has been no treaty
                    since<br/>the treaty of <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>,
                    twenty-five years ago,<br/>till now. We are the owners of these lands,
                    and<br/>we never sold the lands, and they are ours on this<br/>side <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, and yours on the other side <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>. You<br/>may go home and tell <a href="/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a> what we speak.<br/>We understand all you
                    said to us, very well. We<br/>expect you understand us.</said> They had <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a><br/>for an interpreter. They then arose,
                    and stepped<br/>off a few perches, and spoke together, when one<br/>found he had
                    made a mistake, in saying we might<br/>go home, and desired the commissioners to
                    wait, till<br/>they could go to the council, and return with an<br/>answer;
                    which they supposed might be accomplish-<br/>ed in five days. We felt some
                    willingness to accom-<br/>pany them, but the Indians not requesting it,
                    and<br/>others not appearing desirous for it, particularly<br/><a href="/people/celli1">Capt. Elliott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/tmcke1">McKee<persname key="tmcke1"></persname></a>,* who were going along,<br/>we had to resign it. However,
                    we forwarded our<br/>Address, and a short epistle to the Indians, which<br/>we
                    had intended to send from <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> by
                        <a href="/people/celli1">Capt. El-liott<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, some weeks ago; but
                    the commissioners arri-<br/>ving before he set out, he showed our letters
                    to<br/>them, and they thought proper to detain them, pre-<br/>suming we would
                    have an opportunity with them<br/>at the general Council, ourselves. After
                    opening<br/>and reading them, they encouraged us to send them,<br/> though at a
                    late stage of the business. About ten<br/>o'clock, the Indians embarked in a
                    boat, for the<br/><geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>; and <a href="/people/tmcke1">Capt. McKee<persname key="tmcke1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/celli1">Capt.

<p> the same place. Previous to their setting off, I took<br/>an opportunity to
                    impress their minds with the im-<br/>portance of the present critical juncture;
                    as also,<br/> how deeply the interests of humanity was involved<br/>in it. My
                    mind is often involuntarily impressed<br/>with a secret sorrow, and sense of the
                    want of true<br/> sincerity, in this painful business; in which I see<br/>
                    different schemes and opposite interests are engaged;<br/>while the poor natives
                    stand exposed as a mark, to<br/>their grievous injury, and suffering, under an
                    undue<br/> influence.</p></div>

                    land. The inland<br/>parts of the country abounding with extensive<br/>swamps,
                    covered with bushes, coarse grass, rushes,<br/>and flags, make harbours for such
                    innumerable<br/> flights of blackbirds, as prove very injurious to
                    the<br/>production of the neighboring farms, taking nearly<br/>one-third of

<p>Many of the officers of the army are very de-<br/>bauched, and immoral
                    characters, notwithstanding<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_141" n="141"></pb> their
                    civility and kindness to us. There was a cap-<br/>tain much addicted to profane
                    swearing in our com-<br/>pany, and who kept a squaw; upon being put in
                    mind<br/>of the odiousness of such a course of life, and the dan-<br/>ger he
                    stood in, replied, he thought no harm would<br/> ensue — that we might think it
                    very strange, that he<br/> never lay down, drunk or sober, without saying
                    his<br/> prayers. Which, strange as it was, he asserted was<br/> the case.</p></div>

<p>The Detroit sloop left this place, loaded
                    with<br/> skins and peltry, for <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>. I
                    spent some part<br/>of this day, on the margin of the river, and bay.<br/>Here
                    once stood the town and garrison of <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>.<br/> Multitudes of graves, and many foundations of
                    build-<br/>ings are yet discoverable. We are told, about seven-<br/>ty years
                    ago, the Indians rose, and in one night mas-<br/>sacred every person in the
                    place, except the Ro-<br/>man priest, who was concealed by a squaw; and
                    also<br/>burnt all the houses. After which, the garrison was<br/>built eighteen
                    miles higher up the river, on the op-<br/>posite side, where it now stands.
                    Since the English<br/>have been in possession of Canada, some bold
                    at-<br/>tempts of like nature, have been made: one by the<br/>noted Indian,
                    Pontiac, on the present <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>;
                    which,<br/>in all human probability, would have succeeded, but<br/>for some
                    intelligence from a squaw, communicated<br/>the evening preceding the intended
                    bloody enter-<br/>prize, to the commander, who afterwards attempted<br/> to
                    dislodge them from the suburbs. This brought<br/>on the fray, from whence
                        <geogname key="blood">bloody bridge</geogname> took its<br/> name, where
                    three officers and seventy soldiers are<br/>reported to have fallen, about a
                    mile and a half above<br/><a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. When the
                    veteran saw himself the con-<br/>queror, it inspired him with ambition to get
                        upon<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_142" n="142"></pb>
<geogname key="fight">Fighting Island</geogname>, and attack one of the king's
                    ships,<br/> laden with stores for the garrison. As the channel<br/> obliged her
                    to come within musket shot of the island,<br/>where a large number of Indians
                    had placed them-<br/>selves, and the ship lay becalmed, they poured
                    in<br/>bullets, like hail, against her side, hoping to have<br/>sunk her. But
                    finding, after two days experiment,<br/> their metal too light to effect their
                    purpose, they<br/> took to their canoes, and made to her with toma-<br/>hawks in
                    hand. Many got on board, notwithstand-<br/>ing the efforts of the few mariners;
                    and when all<br/>were expecting death in a few minutes, the captain,<br/>a
                    resolute man, gave orders aloud, "Blow up the<br/> ship" — he having powder on
                    board; and one of the<br/> Indians understanding English, terrified with
                    the<br/>horrid orders, gave the alarm quickly to his com-<br/>panions, who
                    instantly jumped off the vessel, some<br/>into their canoes, and others into the
                    water. Thus<br/>the vessel, and many lives, were saved.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that on the same day the before<br/> mentioned attempt was made
                    on <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, by <a href="/places/ponti">Pon-tiac<placename key="ponti"></placename></a>; <a href="/places/michi">Michilimackinac<placename key="michi"></placename></a>, <geogname key="stjos">St. Josephs</geogname>,
                    and <a href="/places/presq">Presque-Isle<placename key="presq"></placename></a><br/> garrisons were all
                    attacked, and carried by the In-<br/>dians.</p></div>

<p>Last night, the musquetoes exceeded any<br/>
                    thing of the kind I ever experienced. Universal<br/>complaint was murmured
                    through the camp this<br/> morning; by both house, tent, and ship lodgers;
                    by<br/>which it appeared, the attack was general. This<br/>confirmed an account
                    I heard in this country, of a<br/>fortification being erected in New Spain, in
                    the fore-<br/>part of the year, which, on account of the incredible<br/>number
                    of these insects, which infested it, the troops<br/>were obliged to abandon.</p>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_143" n="143"></pb>
<p>This day, about three o'clock, whilst a large com-<br/>pany of us were dining
                    sumptuously, and drinking<br/>wine in the parlour, among whom were <a href="/people/jabbo1">James Ab-bott<persname key="jabbo1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/spark1">Sparkman<persname key="spark1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/lroe1">Lawyer Roe<persname key="lroe1"></persname></a>, from
                        <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, the<br/> awful language of
                    mortality was inscribed in the kit-<br/>chen, by the decease of a poor,
                    emaciated <a href="/organizations/pawnee">Paunee<orgname key="pawnee"></orgname></a><br/><a href="/people/toby1">slave<persname key="toby1"></persname></a>, who had been
                    declining some time. Our be-<br/>loved friend, <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a>, attended him, in his<br/>last moments, travailing with
                    him, in Christian sym-<br/>pathy, I trust to the staying of his mind, in the
                    so-<br/>lemn period. Some others, to my astonishment,<br/> treated it with as
                    much indifference, as if only a<br/> caterpillar had been bruised. After dinner,
                    I retired<br/>about thirty perches into a garden, where the loud<br/> peals of
                    laughter, which could easily have been heard<br/>half a mile, were truly
                    distressing. I mentioned the<br/>solemn subject to one of the British officers,
                    who<br/>replied, "One of my brother officers, whom I loved<br/>dear as my life,
                    was departing lately; I went to him,<br/>and bid him farewell; poor fellow, God
                    help you:<br/>and returned to drink wine." A few boards being<br/>nailed
                    together, about sun-set the same day, the<br/>corpse was put in, and attended to
                    the grave, on<br/>the river bank, by about sixty persons, including<br/> Indians
                    and Negroes, where <a href="/people/jmoor3">Joseph Moore<persname key="jmoor3"></persname></a> preached<br/>
                    his funeral sermon; and there was an end of poor<br/>
<a href="/people/toby1">Toby<persname key="toby1"></persname></a>'s pilgrimage.</p></div>

<p>A day of close inward exercise, on
                    discover-<br/>ing in several of our company, an eye watching for<br/>evil, and
                    seeking occasion to vilify and reproach us:<br/>and thereby, to undervalue, and
                    lay waste our tes-<br/>timony, to the requisite purity of the gospel —
                    and<br/>if possible, to render us as abandoned as themselves.</p></div>

<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_144" n="144"></pb>
<p>This day, the lake is exceeding rough,
                    which<br/> must retard the return of the Indian chiefs, who have<br/> now been
                    gone seven days.</p>
<p>This evening, two <a href="/organizations/mahican">Mohicons<orgname key="mahican"></orgname></a> arrived from the In-<br/>dian council, who brought us a
                    letter from <a href="/people/haupa1">Captain Hendricks Apaumut<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>,
                    who informs, there is a pros-<br/>pect of a treaty commencing in a very few
                    days. —<br/> The messengers state, that sickness, and a great<br/> mortality
                    prevails in the Indian camp — which took<br/> off a worthy man of their nation,
                    named <a href="/people/mohic">Sam<persname key="mohic"></persname></a>, with<br/> whom I was acquainted.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-09">9th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>This morning, twelve <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawas<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,<br/> and <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Munseys<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a>, called to see us, on
                    their return home,<br/> having staid till their clothes were mostly in
                    rags,<br/>and I believe, they were alarmed at the contagion.<br/> They report
                    the decease of seventeen Indians,<br/> amongst whom were three <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipawa<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a> chiefs; and
                    in-<br/>form, that in consequence of the sickly situation,<br/> they were about
                    to move their camp eight miles<br/> down the river, near the side of the lake.
                    Which<br/> is agreeable to us, as it will be so much nearer, and<br/>not so much
                    infested with musquetoes.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-10">10th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Last evening, several of the Indians,
                    who<br/> arrived in the morning, came to us, much disguised<br/> with liquor,
                    and wanted more: which not being<br/>granted, they became rather sulky, rude,
                    and inso-<br/>lent. One of them, who called himself <a href="/people/cherm1">Capt.
                        Her-maunus<persname key="cherm1"></persname></a>, laid hold of me, partly in jest, and
                    squeezed<br/> me hard, and said, you Quaker, you my brother.<br/> One said, his
                    heart was bad, and another said, I am<br/>a devil, and my name is devil. Several
                    of our com-<br/>pany, best acquainted with Indians, appeared alarm-<br/>ed with
                    apprehensions of danger, and did not go<br/>into their tents till near morning.
                    About eight<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_145" n="145"></pb> o’clock, one of them
                    came from the camp, who ex-<br/>hibited a horrid spectacle — hallooing, I am a
                    man —<br/> I am a warrior — dashing his fist against a tree, drew<br/> out his
                    scalping knife, brandished it through the air<br/>with uplifted hand, roaring
                    and making a terrible<br/>appearance. At length a sober Indian came,
                    and<br/>took him away. However, with the trouble of In-<br/>dians, and a host of
                    musquetoes, I dont know that<br/>I slept ten minutes during the night.</p>
<p>We dined this day on a masquenungy, which<br/>weighed eighteen pounds; a very
                    delicious fish. It<br/> was speared by an Indian. <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname> abounds with<br/>sturgeons so plentifully, that a couple of
                    men have<br/>taken more than a ton weight before breakfast. It<br/>is said, they
                    originated from four of that species<br/>having been put in, above the falls, by
                    a French<br/> officer; before which, it is reported, none were to<br/>be found
                    above the great <geogname key="niagf">falls</geogname>; and when first
                    dis-<br/>covered by the Indians, they were much alarmed.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-11">11th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>The Ottoway schooner, arrived from
                        <a href="/places/ferie">FortErie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, in which came <a href="/people/jparr2">Jasper Parrish<persname key="jparr2"></persname></a>, who left <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>
<date when="1793-07-27">twenty-seventh of last month</date>. He brought<br/> me
                    letters from my beloved brother and sister<br/> Dawes, and my daughter <a href="/people/mmill2">Mary<persname key="mmill2"></persname></a>, which were very<br/>cordial and refreshing;
                    also, the newspapers con-<br/>taining much information.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Chipawa fell down from <a href="/places/detro">De-troit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, bound for <a href="/places/ferie">Fort
                        Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, in which upwards of<br/>twenty <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Indians returned, being tired
                    out<br/> with waiting; some had got sick, and all were rag-<br/>ged and
                    dirty.</p>
<p>This day, had a meeting on <a href="/places/gisle">Groes-isle<placename key="gisle"></placename></a>, which,
                    on<br/>some accounts, was a trying season, but we return-<br/>ed with peaceful

<p>Our commissioners had a visit from <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a>, on his return from <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>; he gave<br/> them an account, as I have
                    before noted, respecting<br/>the treaty with the southern Indians; also
                    mention-<br/>ed some of <a href="/people/amcgi1">McGillivrey<persname key="amcgi1"></persname></a>'s
                    duplicity in Indian affairs;<br/>and that the Spanish governor of <a href="/places/pensa">Pensacola<placename key="pensa"></placename></a> told<br/>him, he was sorry he had sold off
                    so much land to<br/>the United States; and that he could not serve
                    two<br/>masters, he must cleave to the one or the other, and<br/>he might choose
                    which. It appeared that <a href="/people/amcgi1">McGil-livrey<persname key="amcgi1"></persname></a> had
                    proposed to sell to the south branch of<br/> the <geogname key="ocone">Ocomic
                        river</geogname>; but the nation at large withstood<br/>it, and would give
                    up no further than the north;<br/> to which the <a href="/organizations/creek">Creeks<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a> unitedly agreed. That divers<br/>
                    attempts had been made to settle it, and large clear-<br/>ings were made upon
                    it; but at present, he believed,<br/> there was not a standing house on the
                    space of three<br/> hundred miles in length, and from thirty to seventy<br/> in
                    breadth, according to the windings of the river.<br/>Which space, is the bone of
                    contention at present,<br/> with the <a href="/organizations/creek">Creek<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a> nation. <a href="/people/cwell2">Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a> also says, the<br/> Spaniards are industriously making
                    interest with<br/> the southern Indians, through the agency of one<br/>
<a href="/people/olive1">Oliver<persname key="olive1"></persname></a>, a Frenchman: which is a subject of a
                    seri-<br/>ous nature to our government.</p>
<p> This afternoon, the commissioners sent off two<br/>
<a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> express
                    to <a href="/people/amcke1">Col. McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>; I suppose,<br/>to let him know,
                    that the tedious process of the<br/>business began to feel unpleasant to many of
                    the<br/> company. One of the interpreters, <a href="/people/hjone1">Horatio
                        Jones<persname key="hjone1"></persname></a>,<br/> had lately heard of the decease of his wife, since<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_147" n="147"></pb> he left home, and several of our company
                    were<br/>sick.</p>
<p>I spent this evening with <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt. Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a>,
                        and<br/><a href="/people/cbunb1">Capt. Bunbury<persname key="cbunb1"></persname></a>, at <a href="/people/ccald1">Capt. Caldwell<persname key="ccald1"></persname></a>'s, where <a href="/people/cwell2">Capt.Welbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a> talked freely respecting the southern
                    In-<br/>dians, and their confederates; among whom was the<br/>governor of
                        <a href="/places/pensa">Pensacola<placename key="pensa"></placename></a>, and the Indian nations
                    quite<br/>to the <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>, and the mountain
                    Leader also,<br/>who was considered fully attached to the interest of<br/>the
                    United States. All which intelligence, with<br/>the present tardy process of our
                    commission, im-<br/>pressed my mind with ideas of horror and
                    distress,<br/>approaching our extensive frontier, with some<br/>doubts, that the
                    speculation in western estates, will<br/> be disastrous to public tranquility
                    and peace.</p></div>

<p>Three <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> came to our camp, and<br/>report

                    agreed to invite us<br/>to the council. This day my head felt much
                    disor-<br/>dered, occasioned, I supposed, by getting wet in our<br/>tent by
                    rain, just as we lay down. <a href="/people/wsave1">William

<p>My mind much tossed — looking towards<br/>
                    home — then to the Yearly Meeting. I took a walk<br/>down the river, where I
                    erected a seat under the<br/>spreading boughs of a buttonwood, of whose
                    branch-<br/>es and broad leaves I made a carpet, and sat myself<br/>down in the
                    native splendor of one of the aboriginal<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_148" n="148"></pb> lords of the land. I contemplated the tranquil
                    abode<br/>of our first parents in the garden, and felt happy for<br/>a moment,
                    which was succeeded by the reflection<br/>on Jonah's gourd, which it most
                    resembled. I felt<br/>a necessity to breathe for the approach of that
                    peace-<br/>ful and blessed day, when every man shall sit under<br/>his own vine,
                    and fig-tree, and none shall make him<br/> afraid.</p>
<p>This afternoon, two young <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> arrived.<br/>They looked wild and afraid. One of them
                    was<br/> introduced to <a href="/people/glinc1">Gen. Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, and
                    handed him a mes-<br/>sage in writing, importing that the several
                    treaties<br/>held at <a href="/places/fmint">Fort McIntosh<placename key="fmint"></placename></a>,
                        <a href="/places/fmiam">Miami<placename key="fmiam"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/muski">Muskingum<placename key="muski"></placename></a>, &amp;c.<br/> where lands had been ceded by two or
                    three nations<br/> only, were not valid; as they had no right to dispose<br/> of
                    lands. And as for the large sums of money pro-<br/>posed to be paid down for the
                    country, they did not <br/>want it; and a great many of them did not know
                    the<br/> use of it. Therefore, desired it might be applied,<br/> with the
                    proposed yearly salary, to the indemnifica-<br/>tion of the settlers north of
                    the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>. And as they<br/>supposed they were
                    mostly poor people, or else they<br/>would not have settled on disputed lands;
                    that there-<br/>by they might be induced to move off; and make<br/>the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> the boundary. For it was their land — the<br/>
                    country to the westward was filled up — they had no<br/>where else to repair to,
                    and they were determined<br/>to lay their bones in it. As to the concessions,
                    the<br/> commissioners proposed to make, by giving money,<br/> they did not want
                    it: next, running a new line, was<br/>but giving them a part of their own land;
                    and as to<br/> disclaiming the right to all their country, by virtue<br/>of the
                    peace made with the king, their father, they<br/>knew they were never conquered,
                    and it could not<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_149" n="149"></pb> be; and as to the
                    right of pre-emption, that the Uni-<br/>ted States, and they only, had a right
                    to purchase<br/>Indian lands, south and east of the lakes, they de-<br/>nied the
                    king or the United States ever having any<br/>such right. Upon the whole, it was
                    received as a<br/>very contemptible speech by the commissioners,
                    and<br/>strongly marked as British manufacture. The two<br/>Indian messengers
                    had a glass of wine each, and<br/>victuals set. They eat but little, got up and
                    slipped<br/>away, I believe conscious that the contents of their<br/>message
                    would not be pleasing. This soon appear-<br/>ed to be the case, as the baggage
                    was ordered on<br/>board the Dunmore immediately — some for safety<br/>proposing
                    to sleep on board.</p>
<p>It felt exceeding gloomy to Friends. We got to-<br/>gether to see if any thing
                    opened further for us to<br/>do; which at present does not appear.
                    Therefore<br/>submit the awful subject to the interposition of the<br/>Divine
                    Hand, and turn our eyes towards our respec-<br/>tive habitations. This evening
                    the two runners des-<br/>patched three days ago to the Indian council,
                    return-<br/>ed, with only a verbal message, importing that the<br/>five nations
                    expected us to come forward, and were<br/>moving six miles down the river, to
                    meet us. Which<br/>appeared a cunning manœuvre of one side, or the<br/>other. I
                    was somewhat put to a consternation, on<br/>hearing <a href="/people/glinc1">Gen.
                        Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a> express, they had received just<br/>such an answer as he
                    could have wished. What his<br/>meaning was, I don't know.</p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-17">17th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Several of our company slept on board
                    the<br/> Dunmore last night, others hurrying on board this<br/> morning. Two
                    runners were despatched with in-<br/>telligence to the Six Nations. About 11
                    o'clock,<br/> we were all on board. My mind felt sorrowful, in<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_150" n="150"></pb> reflecting on the important subject of our
                    journey.<br/>But on turning my mind to consider, if we had omit-<br/>ted any
                    thing we might have done, or what might<br/>yet remain to be done, nothing
                    appeared to give un-<br/>easiness. I therefore rested satisfied in leaving
                    it<br/> to the Lord, who judgeth righteously; and with joy<br/> turned mine eye
                    homeward, willing to leave a set-<br/>tlement so greatly dissipated with every
                    species of<br/> iniquity, that they appear to live almost without law,<br/>
                    morality, or religion. </p></div>

<p>Prosecuting our voyage on the lake — in
                    the<br/>afternoon, we were nearly becalmed — had a season<br/>of solid
                    retirement in the cabin, to our comfort and<br/>satisfaction, though held in
                    much contempt by others,<br/>who were wise and good enough already, in
                    their<br/>own eyes. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-19">19th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Very little wind. Our vessel thronged,
                    ha-<br/>ving thirty-one passengers, exclusive of the ship's<br/>crew, and two
                    bears. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-20">20th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Our vessel glided along in the prospect
                    of<br/>the Looming hills, the land claimed and held by the<br/><a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware Indians<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>. This day,
                    several little birds<br/>came on board our vessel. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-21">21st</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>This day, we could just discover both
                    shores<br/>from the middle of the lake. In the evening, had<br/>some religious
                    conversation with <a href="/people/cford1">Capt. Ford<persname key="cford1"></persname></a>,
                    to<br/>satisfaction. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-22">22nd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>One of our sailors laid hold of a rope on
                    the<br/>boom of our vessel, which gave way, and he fell<br/>over the stern into
                    the water — being a calm time,<br/> he recovered by laying hold of a rope thrown
                    out<br/> to him.</p>
<p>Through the favour of Divine Providence, we<br/>came safe to anchor, about one
                    o'clock in the morn-<br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_151" n="151"></pb>ing of the <date when="1793-08-23">23rd</date>, at <a href="/places/ferie">Fort

<p>From <a href="/people/cwinn1">Winey<persname key="cwinn1"></persname></a>'s, at <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo
                    creek</geogname>,<br/> passed through twenty miles of good land — some
                    <br/>parts swampy — others high, and suitable for wheat —<br/>abounding with
                    limestone, sugar trees, bass wood, <br/>beech, and shellbark hickory — and about
                    twenty <br/>miles of plains. In which distance, are three fine <br/>streams for
                    mills, with excellent fall. Two as large <br/>as one of the forks of <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>, the other as large <br/>as <geogname key="wclay">Whiteclay creek</geogname>. In the swamps and timber <br/>lands,
                    the path was rendered difficult by hundreds <br/>of logs across the way. We met
                    one Indian on the <br/>plains, he was pleased to see us — we gave him some
                    <br/>refreshment. Came across <a href="/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a> and
                    his fami-<br/>ly, in the woods — he was indisposed — <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a><br/>ministered unto him. In the afternoon, we met two
                    <br/>armed men, who looked grim. We pressed forward <br/>as far as possible,
                    fearing they might covet one of <br/>our horses. A little after sun-set, we
                    turned out our <br/>horses at the east end of the great plains, kindled a
                    <br/>fire, and began to model a tent; when sable clouds <br/>obscured the azure
                    sky, and made an awful appear-<br/>ance, which was soon succeeded by tremendous
                    peals <br/>of thunder, boisterous wind, and heavy rain. Many <br/>trees were
                    blown down. We stood exposed to the <br/>vehemence of the elements, without any
                    shelter, <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_153" n="153"></pb> not daring to stand by
                    trees, for fear of lightning. <br/>It lasted near three hours, then cleared
                    away.</p>
<p>After this dreadful storm was over, we renewed <br/>our fire, which was almost
                    extinguished by the rain, <br/>lay down on the wet ground in our wet clothes,
                    <br/>contemplated the wondrous beauty of our spangled <br/>canopy, and rested
                    some, having rode forty miles <br/>the preceding day. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-02">2nd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Resumed our journey through a swampy,
                    <br/>dreary wilderness, for above twenty miles, inter-<br/>spersed with some
                    ridges of very rich land. Passed <br/>over a fine stream for water works, where
                    the water <br/>pitches off a fine limestone rock, six or seven feet at
                    <br/>once. The banks are low and rich. Sometime after, <br/>passed over about
                    ten miles of plains, in which is a <br/>curious spring, covering an acre and a
                    half; the fall <br/>from it is rapid; — the stream as large as <geogname key="wclay">Whiteclay <br/>creek</geogname>. Then passed through an Indian
                    village, on <br/>the flats of the <geogname key="genes2">Genessee
                        river</geogname>: which exceeds any <br/>land I have seen for richness — the
                    grass, pea vines, <br/>and thistles, higher than a man's head, on
                    horse-<br/>back. Thousands of acres fit for mowing — of which <br/>a great deal
                    is cut, and makes excellent fodder, the <br/>pods and peas contributing thereto.
                    We forded the <br/>river, now about as large as <geogname key="brand">Brandywine</geogname>. This <br/>place is thirty miles south of <a href="/places/ontar">Ontario<placename key="ontar"></placename></a>. Lodged at <br/><a href="/people/gberr">Berry<persname key="gberr"></persname></a>'s, on the bank of the river, having rode thir-<br/>ty-five
                    miles. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-03">3rd</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Here we were refreshed, refitted, and
                    pre-<br/>pared to pursue our journey. Here many Indians <br/>resort — one old
                    woman, supposed to exceed one <br/>hundred years — I admired her gray head. She
                    said <br/>she was always kind and good, and always against <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_154" n="154"></pb> quarrels; therefore God had spared her to see
                    the <br/>sun a long time. </p>
<p>The land west of <geogname key="genes2">Genessee</geogname>, belongs to the
                    In-<br/>dians. <a href="/people/rmorr1">Robert Morris<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a> purchased the
                    pre-emption <br/>right of the Massachusetts State, for one hundred <br/>and
                    twenty thousand pounds. </p>
<p>We persevered up the north-west side of the <geogname key="genes2">Gen-<br/>nessee river</geogname>, on the ridge, above thousands of acres
                    <br/>of rich flats along the river below, abounding with <br/>grass as high as a
                    man's head on horse-back; and <br/>when cultivated, has produced fifty bushels
                    of wheat <br/>per acre. Took up lodging with <a href="/people/jmill2">James
                        Miller<persname key="jmill2"></persname></a>, at <br/><a href="/people/cwill1">Captain
                        Williamson<persname key="cwill1"></persname></a>'s, having rode sixteen miles. —<br/>The road from
                        <a href="/people/gberr">Berry<persname key="gberr"></persname></a>’s, here, is good. We met a
                    <br/>number of Indians this day, who appeared friendly. <br/>We spoke to them by
                    an interpreter. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-04">4th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Set out early — missed our road ten miles,
                    <br/>and had to return. Passed on through the <a href="/places/genec">Gennes-see country<placename key="genec"></placename></a> about twelve miles, mostly excellent
                    <br/>land: then over about twelve miles of mountains, <br/>well timbered with
                    chesnut, pine, hemlock, &amp;c.—<br/>Then through about seven miles of piney
                    valley, to a <br/>cabin of bark, where we struck up a fire after dark,
                    <br/>thankful to have a house of our own: which was all <br/>the comforts we
                    had, having nothing for ourselves <br/>or horses, to eat. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-05">5th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Collected our horses, with some difficulty
                    —<br/>set out soon after day-light, and rode eleven miles <br/>to <a href="/places/bath">Bath<placename key="bath"></placename></a>, the seat of <a href="/people/cwill1">Captain
                        Williamson<persname key="cwill1"></persname></a>, a little vil-<br/>lage, where about twelve houses
                    have been built this <br/>summer. Called at a public house, and got a
                    break-<br/>fast of good coffee. Set out after breakfast, and rode <br/>over, and
                    round the ends of several high, barren <br/>mountains, sixteen miles, to the
                        <a href="/places/ppost">Painted Post<placename key="ppost"></placename></a>; about <br/><pb facs="SW_JL1793_Page_155" n="155"></pb> which, is abundance of excellent bottom and
                    upland. <br/>Having mostly kept down the <geogname key="cohoc">river
                        Kohockton</geogname>, for <br/>thirty miles. After refreshing ourselves, and
                    feed-<br/>ing our horses, rode along some excellent low lands, <br/>and crossed
                    the <geogname key="canis">Canistiere river</geogname>, at its junction with
                    <br/>the <geogname key="tioga">Chemung, or Tioga river</geogname>, which we rode
                    up,<br/>thirteen miles, and got to <a href="/people/clind2">Col.
                        Lindley<persname key="clind2"></persname></a>'s a little af-<br/>ter dark. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-06">6th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Set forward up the river, nine miles, to
                    <a href="/people/probe2">Ro-berts<persname key="probe2"></persname></a>'s. Then set forward, along a
                    tolerable road, <br/>up <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>, for ten or
                    twelve miles further, when we <br/>left the river, and ascended and descended
                    several <br/>rugged hills, for about nine miles, hoping to have <br/>got to the
                        <a href="/places/block">Block-house<placename key="block"></placename></a>. But the night proved very
                    <br/>dark, and the pine timber so high and shady, that <br/>we could not make
                    out the way. After alighting,<br/>scrabbling for some distance through mud,
                    bushes, <br/>&amp;c. we were obliged to give up the idea of reaching <br/>the
                    stage. Tied the horses to the bushes, very hun-<br/>gry, as were ourselves also.
                        <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> struck <br/>fire, which with
                    much difficulty, we augmented into <br/>a blaze — blundered in the dark for
                    wood, and at <br/>length got a comfortable fire. Laid down in our wet
                    <br/>blankets and clothes; it having rained most of the <br/>preceding day, the
                    ground was moist. </p></div>
<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-07">7th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Rose early, all in health, and rode about two
                    <br/>miles to the <a href="/places/block">Block-house<placename key="block"></placename></a>, about
                    thirty-seven miles <br/>from <a href="/people/clind2">Col. Lindley<persname key="clind2"></persname></a>'s.
                    Breakfasted, and fed our horses <br/>well; then resumed our journey, seventeen
                    miles, to <br/><a href="/people/jkyle1">Kyle<persname key="jkyle1"></persname></a>'s, on <geogname key="lycom">Lycoming creek</geogname>. The road mountainous <br/>and rough.
                    Dined, and rode fourteen miles, to <a href="/people/jwint1">Win-ters<persname key="jwint1"></persname></a>'s. My mare very lame, having wrenched off <br/>two
                    of her shoes in the mountains, forty miles back. <br/>Here we got our horses
                    shod, and lodged. </p></div>

<p>Had a solemn parting opportunity with

Left <br/><geogname key="loyac">Loyalsock creek</geogname> behind, crossed <geogname key="muncr">Muncey</geogname>, and rode <br/>thirty miles, to <a href="/places/north1">Northumberland<placename key="north1"></placename></a>, a town of about <br/>thirty houses, pleasantly
                    situated between the north <br/>and south branches of <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, at their junc-<br/>tion: near which place, we
                    crossed the <geogname key="chill">Chilisquagus</geogname>. </p></div>

<div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-12">12th</date>. <placename></placename></dateline>
<p>Set out — crossed the <geogname key="westb">west branch</geogname> — rode <br/>down the west side of the river to
                        <geogname key="lcross">Litle</geogname>'s ferry, <br/>where I rode the
                    river: having travelled thirty-one <br/>miles. Lodged at <a href="/people/mbowe1">Michael Bowers<persname key="mbowe1"></persname></a>'s, whose wife is <br/>a daughter of <a href="/people/clane1">Cornelius Lane<persname key="clane1"></persname></a>, and desired her love <br/>to

<p><geogname key="lcross">Litle</geogname>'s ferry is twenty miles from <a href="/places/harrisb">Harrisburgh<placename key="harrisb"></placename></a>, <br/>and about three miles from

<p> Hence the company proceeded to their several <br/>homes — having been absent on
