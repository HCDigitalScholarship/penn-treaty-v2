<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                JOURNAL.
                <p>Many of my friends having been solicitous<br/> for the privilege of a perusal of
                    the minutes I<br/> preserved in the course of my late visit to the<br/> Western
                    Indians, I have been induced to devote<br/> a small portion of leisure time to
                    the purpose of<br/> attempting such an arrangement of them, as<br/> would
                    convey, intelligibly, both the route we<br/> took, and the various circumstances
                    attending<br/> upon our journey.</p>
<p>The judicious reader will doubtless make<br/> proper allowances for the
                    difficulty there is in<br/> composing an entertaining diary over that of a<br/>
                    history, where circumstances are not necessarily<br/> confined to day and
                    time.</p>
<p>As a suitable introduction to my Journal, I<br/> deem it proper to insert the
                    following letter. It<br/> will serve to show the intercourse which had<br/>
                    previously taken place between the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian
                        Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> of <orgname key="bym"><a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> Yearly Meeting</orgname> and<br/> some of the

                                of our hearts,</salute></opener>
<p>-We<br/> have received you speech from the hand of our<br/> friend,
                                <a href="/people/wwell1">Wm. Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, with the implements
                            of<br/> husbandry, that you were so kind to send to his<br/> care,-all
                            in good order.</p>
<p>Brothers, it is our wish that the Great Spirit<br/> will enable you to
                            render to your Red Brethren<br/> that service which you appear to be so
                            desirous<br/> of doing them, and which their women and<br/> children are
                            so much in need of.</p>
<p>Brothers, we will try to use the articles you<br/> have sent us, and if
                            we should want more, we<br/> will let you know it.</p>
<p>Brothers, we are sorry to say that the minds<br/> of our people are not
                            so much inclined towards<br/> the cultivation of the earth as we could
                            wish<br/> them. </p>
<p>Brothers, our Father, the President of the<br/> United States, has
                            prevented our traders from<br/> selling liquor to our people, which is
                            the best<br/> thing he could do for his Red Children.</p>
<p>Brothers, our people appear dissatisfied, be-<br/>cause our traders do
                            not, as usual, bring them<br/> liquor, and, we believe, will request our
                            Father<br/> to let the traders bring them liquor, and if he<br/> does,
                            your Red Brethren are all lost forever.</p>
<p>Brothers, you will see, from what we have<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_004" n="4"></pb> said, that our
                            prospects are bad at present,<br/> though we hope the Great Spirit will
                            change the<br/> minds of our people, and tell them it will be<br/>
                            better for them to cultivate the earth than to<br/> drink whiskey.</p>
<p>Brothers, we hope the Great Spirit will per-<br/>mit some of you to come
                            and see us,- when you<br/> will be able to know whether you can do
                            any-<br/>thing for us or not.</p>
<p>Brothers, we delivered you the sentiments of<br/> our hearts, when we
                            spoke to you at <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore,<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>* <note rend="asterisk">*See Appendix.</note><br/> and shall say nothing
                            more to you at present.<br/> We now take you by the hand, and thank
                            you<br/> for the articles you were so kind to send us. </p>

<p>This letter having claimed the solid consider-<br/>ation of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee on Indian Affairs<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, at a<br/> meeting

                    conclusion<br/> and minute was, at that time, the result of their<br/>
                    deliberations:</p>
<floatingtext type="minutes">
<dateline><date when="1804-02-06"></date><placename key="balti1"></placename></dateline>
<p>The subject of a visit to the Indians, agreea-<br/>bly to the desire they
                            express in the foregoing<br/> letter, being solidly considered, the
                            Committee<br/> are united in judgment, that visit to them at<br/> this
                            time would be the most likely means of ob-<br/>
<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_005" n="5"></pb>taining a knowledge of the disposition they are<br/>
                            in, and enable Friends to ascertain what would<br/> be the best course
                            to pursue to be useful to them.<br/> The following Friends are therefore
                            nominated<br/> to that service, and requested to proceed in the<br/>
                            visit as soon as convenient, to wit: <a href="/people/gelli1">George
                                Ellicott,<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a>

<a href="/people/etyso1">Elisha Tyson.<persname key="etyso1"></persname></a></p>
<p>They are also authorized to take one or more<br/> suitable persons with
                            them to reside amongst the<br/> Indians, to instruct them in agriculture
                            and<br/> other useful knowledge, if there should appear<br/> to be a
                            prospect of such an establishment being<br/> beneficial to them.</p>

<p>My name having been entered upon the minute,<br/> and thus placed upon this very
                    interesting appoint-<br/> ment, was to me a subject of much thoughtful-<br/>ness
                    and exercise; and believing finally that the<br/> peace of my own mind was
                    concerned in a pas-<br/>sive submission to the judgment of my friends,<br/> I
                    accordingly made provision for the journey,<br/> and on the <date when="1804-02-23">23d of the 2d month, 1804</date>, left my<br/> home; first
                    witnessing those sensations due to<br/> human nature, in an affectionate
                    farewell to my<br/> family connexions and friends; rode to <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>, and joined my friend,
                        <a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a>,<br/> from whence we
                    proceeded on our journey; taking<br/> with us <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                        Denis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, a member of our So-<br/>ciety, who has concluded to
                    accompany us, for<br/> the purpose of residing with the Indians, in order<br/>
                    to instruct them in agriculture; reached <placename key="brook">Brooke-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_006" n="6"></pb>ville</placename>, and lodged at <a href="/people/cbent1">Caleb
                        Bentley's<persname key="cbent1"></persname></a>-making<br/> 27 miles. The weather cold, with some
                    snow.<br/> Nothing remarkable occurred, except that, in<br/> crossing a miry
                    glade, my horse fell and threw<br/> me; neither of us received a hurt.</p>

<p>Bade farewell to my relatives<br/> and connexions at <a href="/places/brook">Brookeville<placename key="brook"></placename></a>, and rode to <a href="/places/nolan">Now-land's
                        Ferry<placename key="nolan"></placename></a>-28 miles-a very muddy and cold<br/> day. The high wind
                    preventing us from cross-<br/>ing the <geogname key="potor">Potomac
                        river</geogname>, we rode to the house of<br/>
<a href="/people/glepl1">George Lepley<persname key="glepl1"></persname></a>, a neighboring farmer, where
                    we<br/> found good accommodations, and were kindly<br/> entertained. </p>

<p>Crossed the <geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname> early this morn-<br/>ing,
                    passed over the <geogname key="catom">Catoctin mountain</geogname>, taking<br/>
                    the village of <a href="/places/waterf">Waterford<placename key="waterf"></placename></a> in our way;
                    thence<br/> through the gap of the <a href="/places/short1">Short
                        Hill<placename key="short1"></placename></a>, over the <geogname key="bluerm">Blue<br/> Ridge</geogname>
                    to Warmsley's Ferry over the <geogname key="shenr">Shenandoah<br/>
                        river</geogname>; thence across the <geogname key="shenr">Shenandoah</geogname> to the<br/> house of our friend, <a href="/people/jmcph1">John McPherson<persname key="jmcph1"></persname></a>, a dis-<br/>tance of 29 miles. This
                    day's journey has been<br/> highly entertaining; mountain rising above<br/>
                    mountain, and farm above farm, till we reached<br/> the summit of the <geogname key="bluerm">Blue Ridge</geogname>, from whence<br/> a most extensive and
                    beautiful prospect of the<br/> country, both on the east and west side of
                    the<br/> mountain, was full in view. From the top of<br/> this commanding
                    eminence, we were the specta-<br/>tors of a beautiful natural scene. A cloud,
                    small<br/> in its appearance, passing nearly upon a level<br/> with our
                    elevation, cast its shadow upon the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_007" n="7"></pb><a href="/places/goosec">Goose
                        Creek settlement<placename key="goosec"></placename></a> below, for several miles<br/> in extent. The
                    precise shape of the cloud, with<br/> all its indentations, was visible in the
                    shadow;<br/> the indentations bearing the same enlarged pro-<br/>portions, with
                    the shadow, to the cloud.</p>
<p>An extraordinary deceptibility in human<br/> vision is evident, in a view of the
                        <geogname key="shenr">Shenandoah<br/> river</geogname>, from the summit of
                    the <geogname key="bluerm">Blue Ridge.</geogname> The<br/> river, in the
                    estimation of some of our company,<br/> did not appear to be further from us
                    than the<br/> distance of half a mile and it proved to be not<br/> nearer than
                    three or four miles.</p>

<p> Passed across the <geogname key="shenv">Shenandoah valley</geogname>,<br/> a
                    body of excellent limestone land. This valley<br/> is several hundred miles in
                    length, and general-<br/>ly from 20 to 25 miles in width, lying between<br/> the
                        <geogname key="bluerm">Blue Ridge</geogname> and the <geogname key="norm">North Mountains.</geogname><br/> Many parts of it retain to this day the
                    name of<br/> barrens, though now heavily timbered, being at<br/> the time the
                    land was taken up, covered with<br/> scrubby bushes. On our way we crossed a
                    small<br/> river called the <geogname key="opekr">Opekon</geogname>,-and it
                    being the first<br/> day of the week, we attended the <a href="/organizations/ridge">Ridge
                        Meeting of Friends<orgname key="ridge"></orgname></a>, after which we spent the remainder
                    of<br/> the day, and lodged at night, at the house of our<br/> friend, <a href="/people/dlupt1">David Lupton<persname key="dlupt1"></persname></a>, at the foot of the <geogname key="norm">North<br/> Mountain</geogname>,-having travelled 18 miles. One
                    of<br/> our horses faltered this morning, having been<br/> too well fed at last
                    night's quarters. </p>

<p>This day travelled 31 miles, and lodged<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_008" n="8"></pb> at Clayton's Ordinary,*
                        <note rend="asterisk">*An Ordinary, is another name for a house
                        afford-<br/>ing indifferent entertainment.</note> having crossed the<br/>
<geogname key="norm">North Mountain</geogname>, <geogname key="timbr">Timber
                        Ridge</geogname>, <geogname key="sandr">Sandy Ridge</geogname><br/> and
                        <geogname key="cacam">Capon Mountain</geogname>; also forded <geogname key="gcacar">Great Capon<br/> river</geogname> and <geogname key="nrive">North river</geogname>. Our road led us through<br/> several long and
                    narrow valleys, which were well<br/> timbered and rich; we have also passed
                    large<br/> tracts of mountainous, uncultivated, and doubt-<br/>less never to be
                    cultivated land. It is said deer<br/> are very plenty in the tract through which
                    we<br/> have passed to-day, but none were discovered by<br/> us. Upon some of
                    the mountains, and also in<br/> the valleys, we observed a few tolerably
                    well-<br/>looking farms; we have also noticed several<br/> small sugar camps in
                    the course of this day's<br/> journey.</p>

<p>Continued our journey,-forded the<br/>
<geogname key="lcacr">Little Capon river</geogname>, the south branch of
                        <geogname key="potor">Poto-<br/>mac</geogname>, <geogname key="pattc">Patterson's creek</geogname>, and the north branch of<br/>
<geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname>. We also travelled over <geogname key="lcacm">Little Capon<br/> Mountain</geogname>, <geogname key="sbranm">South Branch Mountain</geogname> and <geogname key="norbm">North<br/>
                        Branch Mountain</geogname>, passing through <a href="/places/sprin">Springfield<placename key="sprin"></placename></a>,<br/>
<a href="/places/frankf">Frankford<placename key="frankf"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/cres">Cresapsburg<placename key="cres"></placename></a> villages, reaching<br/>
<a href="/places/musta">Musselman's tavern<placename key="musta"></placename></a>, near the foot of the
                        <geogname key="allmo">Alle-<br/>ghany Mountains</geogname>; making a journey
                    of 37 miles.</p>
<p>A snow has been falling for some hours upon<br/> the remains of a former snow ten
                    inches in<br/> depth. Our journey to-day has been very en-<br/>tertaining,
                    notwithstanding the severity of the <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_009" n="9"></pb> weather, and the danger at
                    this time attendant,<br/> on climbing up and descending precipices.</p>
<p>There is much in a journey over these moun-<br/>tains to puzzle, as well as
                    amuse, the naturalist.<br/> Many extraordinary natural curiosities have<br/>
                    fallen under our observation, in the diversified<br/> appearance of mountains,
                    rocks and valleys. We<br/> have passed to-day the most ponderous, craggy
                    and<br/> over-jutting rocks we have heretofore met with,<br/> many of which were
                    elevated several hundred<br/> feet above our heads, and seemed to threaten
                    us<br/> with impending danger; which was not a little<br/> magnified, in our
                    apprehensions, from observing<br/> cast bodies of rock, which had evidently
                    tum-<br/>bled from their lofty summits into the valleys.<br/> Had we been
                    disposed to indulge fancy, we<br/> might have figured to ourselves, in a view
                    of<br/> these rude mountains of rocks, many of those<br/> descriptions met with
                    in Roman, Greek or<br/> Egyptian history, of amphitheatres, obelisks,<br/>
                    pyramids, &amp;c. &amp;c; whilst many others exhibit-<br/>ed such regular, wavy
                    appearences, interspersed<br/> alternately with oaks and pines, and soil of<br/>
                    various hues, as seemed to challenge the painter<br/> with his diversified
                    shades of coloring. And could<br/> we have observed here goats, white bears
                    and<br/> reindeer, with now and then a human being<br/> clothed in skins and
                    furs, and with weather a<br/> little colder, we might, perhaps, have been
                    led<br/> to suppose ourselves in Lapland. A few settle-<br/>ments are made in
                    this tract, which are mostly<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_010" n="10"></pb> in the valleys. Deer are said to
                    be very numerous<br/> upon these mountains-several were seen by us.<br/> We also
                    observed seats erected in the branches<br/> of the trees by the hunters, twenty
                    feet in height,<br/> being concealed stations for the purpose of shoot-<br/>ing
                    deer at the Salt Licks. We have also seen<br/> several flocks of turkeys and
                    pigeons in vast<br/> numbers. </p>

<p>Travelled thirty miles upon the <geogname key="allmo">Alle-<br/>ghany
                        Mountains</geogname>, and at night lodged at Smith's<br/> Ordinary. We have
                    to-day passed through land<br/> heavily timbered, tolerably level, and said to
                    be<br/> rich and clear of stone; of this, the snow pre-<br/>vented us from
                    judging. We also crossed over that<br/> part of the <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany ridge</geogname> which divides the<br/> eastern and western
                    waters of our continent-<br/> the streams all bearing a right hand
                    direction:<br/> Near this part of the mountain, our road led us<br/> through the
                    most beautiful and lofty forest of<br/> spruce and pine I ever saw. This forest
                    is call-<br/>ed the Shades. The trees are generally from<br/> 108 to 180 feet in
                    height, with a body not<br/> more than 12 inches in diameter at the surface<br/>
                    of the earth.</p>
<p>We also forded one of the branches of the<br/>
<geogname key="yough">Youghiogany river</geogname>, called the <geogname key="lcross">Little Crossings</geogname>.<br/> The principal ridges which we
                    passed are called<br/> by the mountaineers the <geogname key="backr">Back-bone
                        Ridge</geogname>, (from<br/> its sharp elevation,) the <geogname key="windr">Winding Ridge</geogname> and the<br/>
<geogname key="negm">Negro Mountain</geogname>. On inquiring into the
                    origin<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_011" n="11"></pb> of the name of the latter, we were informed<br/>
                    that many years ago, a white man and a negro<br/> who were hunting together,
                    accidentally fell in<br/> with an Indian upon this ridge who was armed;<br/>
                    both the negro and the Indian betook them-<br/>selves to trees, presented their
                    guns at each<br/> other, and fired at the same moment, and both<br/> fell dead.
                    Thier images are cut upon the trees<br/> behind which they fell, as a memento of
                    the<br/> circumstance. The ridge has ever since been<br/> called the <geogname key="negm">Negro Mountain.</geogname></p>
<p>Deer and turkies are numerous upon these<br/> mountains. The hunters have in many
                    places<br/> erected seats, as heretofore described, for the pur-<br/>pose of
                    shooting deer.</p>
<p>Over the greater part of our journey to-day<br/> we have found snow two feet in
                    depth. A tolera-<br/>ble track is however beaten for us by a descrip-<br/>tion
                    of pedlars, who pass by the name of Packers.<br/> These people carry on a
                    considerable trade be-<br/>tween the <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a> settlements and <a href="/places/winch">Winchester<placename key="winch"></placename></a>,<br/> in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, as also with several other villages<br/> in the western
                    part of that State.</p>
<p>They take with them upon horses, bags of<br/> flax, which article they purchase
                    at <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a> at<br/> a low price; this they
                    dispose of at an advance,<br/> and in return carry salt, for which they are
                    well<br/> paid at <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>. It is not
                    unusual to meet a<br/> Packer, having under his direction half a dozen<br/>
                    loaded horses. These animals on meeting travel-<br/>lers, do not turn aside from
                    the beaten path. We<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_012" n="12"></pb> were several times under difficulties in
                    making<br/> our way through the snow on their account.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-01">3d mo. 1st.</date><placename key="redst1"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day we travelled thirty six<br/> miles, passed through the villages
                        <a href="/places/woods">Woodstack<placename key="woods"></placename></a><br/> and <a href="/places/uniont">Uniontown<placename key="uniont"></placename></a>, and after night reached the<br/> house
                    of our friend, <a href="/people/jcadw1">Jonah Cadwalader<persname key="jcadw1"></persname></a>, in the<br/>
                    neighborhood of <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/redof">Old Fort<placename key="redof"></placename></a>, and near<br/> the <geogname key="monon">Monongahela river</geogname>. On our way we passed<br/> a place called the
                        <a href="/places/gmead">Great Meadows<placename key="gmead"></placename></a>, upon the<br/>
<geogname key="allmo">Alleghany Mountains</geogname>. This place is noted
                    for<br/> an entrenchment, cast up by <a href="/people/gwash1">General
                        Washing-ton<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, then Colonel Washington, when retreating<br/>
                    from a defeat given to a small force under his<br/> command, (near the junction
                    of the <geogname key="alleg">Alleghany</geogname><br/> and <geogname key="monon">Monongahela rivers</geogname>,) history says by a much<br/> superior body
                    of French and Indians. We also<br/> passed over the spot where <a href="/people/ebrad1">Gen. Braddock<persname key="ebrad1"></persname></a> was<br/> buried. His army of 1200
                    chosen men was de-<br/>feated near <a href="/places/fduqu">Fort Du
                        Quesne<placename key="fduqu"></placename></a>, in an unexpected<br/> attack by the Indians. We are told
                    that the<br/>
<a href="/people/ebrad1">General<persname key="ebrad1"></persname></a> and half this number were killed,
                    and<br/> sixty-four out of eighty-five of his officers; of<br/> those who
                    escaped was <a href="/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, at the time<br/>
                    Aid-de-Camp to <a href="/people/ebrad1">General Braddock<persname key="ebrad1"></persname></a>. The
                    de-<br/>feated army brought off their dead commander<br/> and buried him in the
                    road, in order to elude<br/> the search of the Indians for his dead body.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that the land in the<br/> neighborhood of the <a href="/places/gmead">Great Meadows<placename key="gmead"></placename></a> is very<br/> level and the timber
                    heavy, which indicates the<br/> goodness of the soil. A considerable body
                    of<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_013" n="13"></pb>this land was owned by <a href="/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a> at the time<br/> of his death.</p>
<p>This day's journey has been very disagreeable<br/> and cold, owing to a continued
                    fall of snow.<br/> We greatly regretted that the clouds prevented<br/> a view of
                    the <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a> settlements from the top<br/>
                    of <a href="/places/laure">Laurel Hill<placename key="laure"></placename></a>, this being that part of the
                        <geogname key="allmo">Alle­<br/>ghany Mountains</geogname> from which a
                    descent is made<br/> into the country below. From this commanding<br/> eminence
                    the prospect, we are told, is beautiful<br/> beyond description.</p>
<p>Our disappointment, however, was in some<br/> measure recompensed by finding
                    ourselves, when<br/> upon the top of this hill, not only above the<br/> clouds,
                    but also so elevated in a cloud as to find<br/> the particles of snow resembling
                    fog; a proof<br/> that large spits of snow, as they are called, ac­<br/>quire
                    their size by an accumulation of particles<br/> on their way from the clouds to
                    the earth. I may<br/> here mention, that the difficulties and fatigues<br/> of
                    our journey thus far have been rendered light<br/> by the agreeable company of
                    my brother-in-law,<br/>
<a href="/people/tmoor1">Thomas Moore<persname key="tmoor1"></persname></a>, and our esteemed friend,
                        <a href="/people/ijann1">Israel Janney<persname key="ijann1"></persname></a>, the former joining us
                    at <a href="/places/brook">Brookeville<placename key="brook"></placename></a>,<br/> and the latter in the
                        <a href="/places/shenv">Shenandoah Valley<placename key="shenv"></placename></a>. They<br/> are
                    complying with an appointment by our late<br/> Yearly Meeting, in a visit to a
                        <a href="/organizations/redst">Quarterly Meet­ing at <orgname key="redst"></orgname></a></p>

<p>My dear Brothers, Quakers, listen to what<br/> I now say to you. You
                            always called us Indians<br/> your brothers, and now, dear white
                            brothers, I<br/> am in distress, and all my young men who are<br/> with
                            me.</p>
<p>Brothers, will you please to help me to fill<br/> my kettles and my
                            horses' troughs, for I am afraid<br/> my horses will not be able to
                            carry me home<br/> again.</p>
<p>Neighbors, will you please to give, if it is <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_015" n="15"></pb> but a
                            handful a piece, and fetch it out to us, for<br/> my horses are not able
                            to come after it</p>
<p>This is all I have to say at present.</p>

<p>About the time of the reception of this letter,<br/> some Friends, who resided

<floatingtext type="letter">

<p>Brother Quakers, I have a few more words<br/> to say to you.</p>
<p>Brothers, I want that you should all know<br/> what distress I am in.</p>
<p>Brothers, I want you to know I have got<br/> help from some of my near
                            neighbors.</p>
<p>Brothers, I would be glad to know what you<br/> will do for me, if it is
                            but a little.</p>
<p>Brothers, if you cannot come soon, it will<br/> do bye and bye, for my
                            belly is now full.</p>
<p>Brothers, I hope you have not forgot our<br/> great fathers; when they
                            first met, it was in<br/> friendship; we are of the same race.</p>
<p>My Brothers, Quakers, I hope our friendship<br/> will last as long as the
                            world stands. All I have<br/>to say to you now is, that I shall stay
                            here until<br/> two more moons are gone.</p>

<br/>Addressed to my Brothers, the Quakers.</closer>

<p>A considerable quantity of provisions were<br/> furnished by the Friends to these
                    Indians, for <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_016" n="16"></pb> which they expressed great thankfulness.
                        <a href="/people/tarh1">Tar-hie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> himself divided the presents
                    between man<br/> and man, making no difference for distinction<br/> in rank.</p>
<p>These Friends were informed by <a href="/people/trah1">Tarhie<persname key="trah1"></persname></a>, that<br/>
                    several years ago he had sent a talk to the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">In-dian Committee at <orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, accompanied by a<br/> belt of wampum,
                    worth fifty dollars, and had<br/> long been waiting for an answer, but had
                    not<br/> yet received one.</p>
<p>In consequence of this information, a confer-<br/>ence was held at <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>, between such of the<br/> members of the
                        <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> as could be<br/>
                    convened there. The result was a request made<br/> to four Friends of the
                    neighborhood adjacent to<br/> the Indian camp, to visit <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a>, and inform him<br/> that his talk was not received by
                    the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, and that his belt
                    of wampum never<br/> came to their hands. Also, if he had any thing<br/> now to
                    say, he must write again to the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian
                        Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>.</p>
<p>During our stay at <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>, we had an
                    op-<br/>portunity of seeing and admiring the richness<br/> of the land between
                    the foot of the <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany<br/> Mountains</geogname> and
                    the <geogname key="monon">Monongahela River</geogname>. The<br/> people here
                    seem to live in ease and plenty, and<br/> there is scarcely a plantation that
                    does not afford<br/> stone coal and sugar trees. The coal is, I think,<br/>
                    fully equal in quality to the best Liverpool coal,<br/> and is generally used
                    for fuel in the place of<br/>wood; it being much easier and cheaper to pro-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_017" n="17"></pb>cure a supply of coal, than to procure wood, not-<br/>withstanding
                    that article is in great plenty here.</p>
<p>The sugar trees afford sugar in plenty to those<br/> who are sufficiently
                    industrious to make it. Many<br/> families, we are told, make from five hundred
                    to<br/> a thousand pounds, and others make from eight-<br/>een to twenty-five
                    hundred weight, every spring.<br/> The trees do not appear to be injured by
                    draw-<br/>ing off the sap. Molasses of excellent quality<br/> is also made from
                    this tree, and also small beer,<br/> equal to any thing of the kind we met with
                    at<br/> this place, produced from the sap.</p>
<p>Shall I say, a proof of the instability of the<br/> human mind, under the most
                    bountiful supply of<br/> temporal blessings, is to be drawn from the
                    pre-<br/>sent disposition of the inhabitants of <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a>?<br/> Blest with a country rich and fruitful, and
                    posses-<br/>sing other great natural advantages, there is<br/> nevertheless a
                    general feeling of discontent. The<br/> new country beyond the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, lately opened for<br/> sale, has set the
                    general mind afloat. We saw<br/> people who were well settled, and who some<br/>
                    years ago, too, had passed the meridian of life,<br/> strongly affected with the
                    prevailing mania.</p>
</div>

<p>The river <geogname key="monon">Monongahela</geogname> not having yet<br/> risen,
                    we are greatly disappointed in our wish<br/> and intention to take boat at
                        <a href="/places/redst1">Redstone<placename key="redst1"></placename></a> for the<br/> mouth of the
                        <geogname key="miamr">Miami of the Ohio</geogname>. We have,<br/> therefore,
                    no other alternative than to prosecute<br/> a long and doubtless fatiguing
                    journey by land.<br/> This morning, whilst we were preparing to pro-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_018" n="18"></pb>eed on our route, two young men arrived at our<br/> quarters, for
                    the purpose of accompanying us;<br/> one of them a blacksmith, and a member of
                    our<br/> Society, the other a carpenter, and a steady young<br/> man. They are
                    under the pay of government,<br/> and have engaged to reside in the
                    neighborhood<br/> of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, to be
                    employed for the benefit<br/> and instruction of the Indians. Previous to
                    our<br/> leaving home, we had reason to expect that we<br/> should be overtaken
                    by these young men, and<br/> were glad to have our expectations realized.</p>
<p>Again proceeding on our journey, we passed<br/> through <a href="/places/brown">Brownsville<placename key="brown"></placename></a>, a village on the <geogname key="monon">Mononga-<br/>hela River</geogname>; crossed over that river in a boat,
                    and<br/> rode about twenty-six miles to <a href="/places/wash2">Washington<placename key="wash2"></placename></a>,
                    an<br/> inland town. Our ride to-day has been through<br/> a very hilly country,
                    tolerably rich, though badly<br/> watered. It is said that one of the first
                    survey-<br/>ors of this tract of country, when questioned re-<br/>specting its
                    general appearance, replied, <said who="undetermined">It is<br/> like a large
                        meadow filled with stacks of hay.</said><br/> A comparison very apropos.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that near <a href="/places/brown">Brownsville,<placename key="brown"></placename></a><br/> on the <geogname key="monon">Monongahela,</geogname> are the remains of an old<br/> fortification,
                    including several acres of ground.<br/> Mussel shells are yet very abnndant
                    within the<br/> intrenchment; and nearly opposite to the forti-<br/>fication are
                    two fish pots extending quite across<br/> the river; they are made of stone,
                    weighing gene-<br/>rally from thirty to forty pounds. It is said that<br/> the
                    Indians who resided near the spot at the time<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_019" n="19"></pb> of its discovery
                    by the white men, had not even<br/> a traditional knowledge of the making of
                    these<br/> fish pots, nor of the erection of the fortification. </p>
<p>This day, in passing along, my mind has been<br/> involved in much serious
                    reflection on the im-<br/>portance of our mission. And I trust I have in<br/> no
                    small degree felt the responsibility we are<br/> under, not to men only, but to
                    the Great Author<br/> of all good, with an ardency not to be expressed,<br/>
                    that we may indeed discharge the trust reposed<br/> in us, and perform the duty
                    required of us with<br/> propriety.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-10">10th.</date><placename key="shortc"></placename></dateline>
<p>Travelled thirty-four miles, and after<br/> night were glad to reach the house of
                    our friend<br/><a href="/people/jtayl3">Jonathan Taylor<persname key="jtayl3"></persname></a>, in the State
                    of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>; on our<br/> way we passed through the
                    small villages of <a href="/places/taylt">Tay-lorstown<placename key="taylt"></placename></a> and
                        <a href="/places/westl">West Liberty<placename key="westl"></placename></a>. The tract of coun-<br/>try
                    through which we have travelled is generally<br/> fertile and is mostly settled.
                    In the course of<br/> this day's ride, it is observable that limestone is<br/>
                    to be found on the tops of the highest hills, but<br/> is rarely found in the
                    bottoms.</p>
<p>It may now be noted that the hills between<br/> the <geogname key="monon">Monongahela</geogname> and the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio rivers</geogname>
                    are gene-<br/>rally of a very singular description, having two<br/> or three
                    circular elevations, the surface of each<br/> elevation flat for the space of
                    twenty-five to<br/> thirty feet in diameter. These flat appearances<br/> extend
                    quite around the circumference of the<br/> hills, and seem to vie with art for
                    regularity.</p>
<p>This day we crossed in a boat the great <geogname key="ohior">river<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_020" n="20"></pb> Ohio</geogname>. On approaching it, I felt no small degree<br/>
                    of awe. The slow and majestic movement of so<br/> vast a body of running water,
                    added to the re-<br/>collection of the blood which had been spilt re-<br/>lative
                    to its shores, enforced the sensation. With<br/> what obstinacy the poor Indians
                    resisted the de-<br/>signs of the white men in making settlements<br/> west of
                    this river! Having been driven further<br/> and further westward, relinquished
                    claim to tract<br/> after tract, they here made a stand, fixed in a
                    re-<br/>solve, hitherto ye may come, but no farther!<br/> This river shall be
                    the boundary between us!<br/> It shall limit your encroachment! The
                    resist-<br/>ance they made, and the blood which was split,<br/> sufficiently
                    prove the reluctance with which they<br/> gave up the contest. The bottom upon
                    the west<br/> side of the river where we crossed, which was at<br/> the junction
                    of <a href="/places/shortc">Short Creek<placename key="shortc"></placename></a>, is very rich, but not<br/>
                    wide. In this bottom we observed a mound of<br/> earth cast up to the height of
                    fifteen feet, its<br/> diameter at the base forty-five feet, and said to<br/> be
                    a burial place, but whether made by the In-<br/>dians or not is not ascertained.
                    It is said that<br/> two miles below this is a square fortification<br/>
                    containing several acres of ground, enclosed by<br/> a bank of earth thrown up
                    by art to the height<br/> of eight feet.</p>
<p>Along the east shore of the river great de-<br/>struction was made a few years
                    ago by a species<br/> of caterpillar which infested the trees. They<br/> fed
                    upon the leaves, and thus killed trees of<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_021" n="21"></pb> enormous size. Their
                    havoc extended for many<br/> miles along the river, and reached about seven<br/>
                    or eight miles from the shore. </p>

<p>This day being First-day, we rested<br/> ourselves and horses, and were glad to
                    have an<br/> opportunity of attending a meeting of Friends,<br/> called <a href="/organizations/short">Short Creek<orgname key="short"></orgname></a>
                        Meeting. A Monthly Meet-<br/>ing is lately established here by
                        <a href="/organizations/redst">Redstone
                        Quar-terly Meeting<orgname key="redst"></orgname></a>. About forty Friends were at<br/> this
                    meeting, and most of them were new settlers.<br/> The greater number had moved
                    from <a href="/places/ncaro">North Carolina<placename key="ncaro"></placename></a>. The meeting was
                    held in a log house<br/> or cabin, situated upon a beautiful hill, covered<br/>
                    with lofty timber. The difficulties and incon-<br/>veniences of a new
                    settlement, are rendered the<br/> more easy and tolerable, where, as in the
                    instance<br/> of these Friends, a number of families, by agree-<br/>ment, form a
                    settlement in the same neighbor-<br/>hood. In the afternoon several of them
                    visited<br/> us at our lodgings, and expressed sympathy with<br/> us in our
                    undertaking.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-12">12th.</date><placename key="randt"></placename></dateline>
<p>Proceeded on our journey; travelled<br/> thirty-one miles and reached <a href="/places/randt">Randallstown<placename key="randt"></placename></a>; part<br/> of the day has been rainy,
                    and the riding very<br/> disagreeable. We have passed through a body<br/> of
                    land heavily timbered and very rich. There<br/> are yet but few settlements made
                    on this tract.<br/> The first settlers in this new country erect small<br/> log
                    cabins, which they cover with split timber<br/> called puncheons; these they pin
                    to the rafters<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_022" n="22"></pb> with wooden pins. Nails are rarely to be
                    found<br/> in any part of the house. Their floors are hewn<br/> out of the
                    timber, and pinned to the sleepers<br/> with wooden pins. They clear their land
                    by<br/> killing the timber, which is done by girdling the<br/> trees, that is by
                    cutting the bark around the<br/> trees to the wood. They then proceed to
                    the<br/> cultivation of the soil, which produces them abun-<br/>dant crops.</p>
<p>It is a common practice with them to sow<br/> small grain upon the original
                    surface, which is<br/> harrowed in, and such is the looseness and
                    light-<br/>ness of the soil, there seems but little necessity<br/> for the
                    plough in raising the first crop of grain.</p>
<p>Our road led us across a water of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname><br/>
                    called <geogname key="capte">Captena</geogname>; also several streams belonging
                    to<br/> a river called <geogname key="stillr">Stillwater</geogname>; thus named
                    from its<br/> slow, silent progress to the <geogname key="muskr">Muskingum</geogname>.</p>

<p>This day we travelled twenty-five miles<br/> and reached <a href="/places/beath">Beathe's Ordinary<placename key="beath"></placename></a>. We have had<br/> a very disagreeable day's
                    ride. A continued fall<br/> of rain, hail, and snow, and the road very miry<br/>
                    and fatiguing to our horses. The land through<br/> which we have passed not
                    quite so good gene-<br/>rally as that noted yesterday. We, however,<br/> saw
                    considerable bodies of excellent land, parti-<br/>cularly of bottoms. Some of
                    them were of far<br/> greater extent than any we have heretofore met<br/> with,
                    being heavily timbered and very rich.<br/> Scarcely a settlement has yet been
                    made in this<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_023" n="23"></pb> tract; deer are very plenty here. It is to be
                    re-<br/>marked, that in riding the last fifty miles, we<br/> have scarcely seen
                    one of any of the descriptions<br/> of the feathered tribes, except owls. Birds
                    love<br/> to resort to the haunts of men.</p>
<p>Squirrels appear to be very numerous, and<br/> are mostly of a deep black color.
                    In the notes<br/> made on crossing the <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany
                        Mountains</geogname>, I<br/> omitted to observe that the squirrels we
                    saw<br/> there were mostly red, and less in size than the<br/> grey squirrels of
                        <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>. They are the most<br/> active
                    squirrel I ever saw, and are called by the<br/> mountaineers the Chipparee
                    Squirrel. </p>
<p>We this day crossed several of the branches of<br/><geogname key="willc">Will's
                        Creek</geogname>. This creek we understand derived<br/>its name from Will, a
                    famous Indian, who former-<br/>ly had a town upon its banks called <a href="/places/willst">Willstown<placename key="willst"></placename></a>.</p>

<p>Travelled twenty-five miles, crossing in<br/> our way the main branch of
                        <geogname key="willc">Will's Creek</geogname> and a <br/> water called
                        <geogname key="saltc">Salt Creek</geogname>; at night reached <a href="/places/zanev">Zanes-ville<placename key="zanev"></placename></a>, and lodged at <a href="/people/minti1">M'Intire<persname key="minti1"></persname></a>'s tavern. This is<br/> a town lately laid
                    out on the <geogname key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogname>,<br/> opposite to
                    the junction of <geogname key="lickc">Licking creek</geogname>. Its<br/>
                    situation is very level and handsome, and will<br/> doubtless command the trade
                    of this new coun-<br/>try. As we approached the <geogname key="muskr">Muskingum</geogname>, our road<br/>led us upon a hill of about 200 feet
                    elevation,<br/> upon which we rode for a distance of seven<br/> miles; both upon
                    our right and left hand, were<br/> chains of hills about ten miles from us,
                    in<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_024" n="24"></pb> view, bearing the same westerly direction, with<br/>
                    that upon which we travelled. The appearance<br/>of these hills revived the
                    recollection of the<br/><geogname key="bluerm">Blue Ridge</geogname>, and its
                    parallel mountians. Several<br/> mounds or burial places were to-day
                    observed<br/> by us.</p>

<p>This day we travelled thirty miles and<br/> lodged at a small hut called
                    Trimble's. </p>
<p>We ferried the beautiful <geogname key="muskr">river Muskingum</geogname> at<br/>
<a href="/places/zanev">Zanesville<placename key="zanev"></placename></a>, where it is about 600 feet wide,
                    rode<br/> through a tolerable tract of land, till we reached<br/> a creek called
                        <geogname key="jonac">Jonathan's creek</geogname>. From this<br/> creek to
                    the end of this day's journey, a distance<br/> of twenty miles, we rode through
                    land which we<br/> think preferable to any tract we have yet passed,<br/> being
                    more level, the timber heavier and the soil<br/> very rich; many Germans are
                    making settlements<br/> here. Several mounds fell under our observa-<br/>tion
                    to-day; we also saw many deer; seventeen<br/> of these were together in one
                    wheat field.</p>

<p>Rode thirty-two miles, and at night<br/> were permitted to lodge under a roof
                    called<br/> Gray's. We passed through <a href="/places/newlan">New
                        Lancaster<placename key="newlan"></placename></a>, a<br/> town lately laid out, and situated on the
                        great<br/><geogname key="hockhr">Hock-hocking river</geogname>, as it is
                    called upon the<br/> maps. Its size greatly disappointed me; an ac-<br/>tive man
                    may jump from one of its banks to the<br/> other at <a href="/places/newlan">New
                        Lancaster<placename key="newlan"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>This town as well as the neighboring country,<br/> is being rapidly settled by
                    Germans. During<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_025" n="25"></pb> our day's ride, the extraordinary beauty of
                    the<br/> country, as well as the superior excellency of the<br/> land, excited
                    our admiration. Now and then a<br/> prairie or natural meadow containing from
                    fifty<br/> to two hundred acres, apparently a perfect level,<br/> having neither
                    tree, shrub, stump, or stone, and<br/> the soil the deepest black I ever saw in
                    any com-<br/>position of earths, attracted our notice. These<br/> were
                    surrounded by higher ground, covered with<br/> lofty timber, extending to the
                    next prairie, and<br/> thus on till we reached a tract called the <geogname key="piquap">Piqua<br/> Plains</geogname>. Here our admiration was afresh
                    excited<br/> by a view of the most beautiful scenery we had<br/> yet met with.
                    This tract is perfectly level; it is<br/> situated upon the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto river</geogname>, is seven miles in<br/> length, and
                    generally three miles in width, hav-<br/>ing neither tree, stone or shrub, and
                    composed<br/> of the black earth above described; it is in part<br/> under
                    cultivation. About the centre of the<br/> prairie is a circular mound of large
                    diameter,<br/> and about forty feet in height, cast up by art.<br/> It is
                    covered with lofty timber. The people<br/> who cultivate these plains find them
                    to produce<br/> from eighty to one hundred bushels of Indian<br/> corn, and from
                    forty to fifty bushels of Indian<br/> corn, and from forty to fifty bushels of
                    wheat<br/> per acre. They plant corn at the distance of<br/> two and a half to
                    three feet apart, having six to<br/> eight stalks in a hill.</p>
<p>In the course of this day's journey we have<br/> seen deer and turkeys in
                    abundance, and for<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_026" n="26"></pb> several days past have seen vast numbers
                    of<br/> pigeons.</p>

<p>Travelled fifteen miles and arrived at<br/> the town of <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>, where we were well en-<br/>tertained at Tiffin's
                    tavern. The governor of<br/> the State of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>
                    resides here, who having<br/> heard of our arrival, paid us a visit in the
                    even-<br/>ing and supped with us. We were pleased with<br/> his friendly
                    affability. In the course of this<br/> day's short ride, our road led through a
                    continua-<br/>tion of the finest lands.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there are uniformly<br/> three gradations of elevation,
                    from the banks of<br/> the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto river</geogname>. The
                    first is a bottom of about<br/> one mile in extent, very level and covered
                    with<br/> black walnut, buck eye, blue ash, honey locust,<br/> and sugar trees.
                    Then upon another elevation<br/> of about fifteen feet, a second bottom, which
                    ex-<br/>tends from one to two miles, covered with the<br/> same descriptions of
                    timber, though heavier, and<br/> the trees standing nearer together. Then
                    an-<br/>other elevation about the same height, which ex-<br/>tends for many
                    miles, being a little inclined to<br/> hills; the timber composed of a great
                    variety.<br/> People are settling fast upon this tract, and<br/> several mills
                    are already erected upon a creek<br/> belonging to the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname>, which we crossed, called<br/> the <geogname key="killa">Killakanik</geogname>.</p>
<p>On our way we turned aside from our road<br/> to view an ancient fortification.
                    This fortifica-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_027" n="27"></pb>tion is on the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname> bottom adjacent to the river,<br/> and is shaped
                    thus.</p>

<p>The bank of earth thrown up around the for-<br/>tification is about six feet
                    high, surrounded by<br/> a ditch upon the outside, now four feet in width,<br/>
                    and as many in depth. The bank is covered<br/> with lofty timber, as is also the
                    ground within<br/> the intrenchment. There are several mounds<br/> such as have
                    heretofore been described in the<br/> vicinity, and within the town of
                        <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a> there<br/> is another
                    fortification of which the diameter is<br/> about 450 feet. Near this is the
                    largest mound<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_028" n="28"></pb> we have seen, being 100 feet in diameter,
                    and<br/> thirty feet in height, and is a globular figure of<br/> great
                    regularity. Three miles below the town<br/> of <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>, and between the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname> and <geogname key="paintc">Paint<br/> Creek</geogname>,
                    and near their junction, is a fortification<br/> of the following figure:</p>

<p>The banks of this ancient work are about six<br/> feet in height. The eight small
                    circles opposite<br/> the openings or gates are mounds of considerable<br/>
                    size.</p>
<p>I had omitted to mention, that on the east<br/> bank of the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname>, nearly opposite <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>,<br/> we measured to-day a sycamore tree which
                    was<br/> sixteen feet in diameter. The tree is hollow,<br/> and measures
                    thirteen feet across the hollow.<br/> New settlers have frequently encamped in
                    this<br/> tree with their families, whilst they were making<br/> choice of land
                    to settle upon.</p>

<p>Proceeded upon our journey fifteen<br/> miles and lodged at Platter's tavern. On
                    our<br/> way we passed many mounds. Several of them<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_029" n="29"></pb> were of the
                    shape and size of the one described<br/> in the town of <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>. Our attention was<br/> also arrested by the
                    appearance of a bank thrown<br/> up at some distance from the road; on riding
                    to<br/> it we found it to be a very extensive fortifica-<br/>tion. It is
                    situated upon a level plain near<br/>
<geogname key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogname>, one of the waters of the
                        <geogname key="sciot">Scioto<br/> river</geogname>. As this is a work of
                    great labor and curi-<br/>osity, I shall be minute in my description and<br/>
                    give the following figure.</p>
<figure>
<figdesc>Map of fortification on Paint Creek</figdesc>

<ab>Ancient Fortification on <geogname key="paintc">Paint
                                    Creek</geogname>, near <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>, contain-<br/>ing within the embankments
                                nearly one hundred acres.</ab>
</floatingtext>
</figure>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_030" n="30"></pb>
<p>The bank which is cast up for the fortification<br/> is now fully four feet in
                    height, and thirty-three<br/> in width, at the base covered with lofty
                    timber.</p>
<p>The figure marked (A) is a very regular oval<br/> mound 500 feet in diameter,
                    from one extremity<br/> to another the longest way, and 300 feet in<br/>
                    diameter the other way; perpendicular height is<br/> about thirty feet. This
                    mound is paved over<br/> with stone, and has upon it trees of large size,
                    as<br/> well as the remains of decaying trees, which<br/> after acquiring their
                    full growth have fallen.<br/> The two circles marked (B) are very perfect<br/>
                    globular figures. They are one hundred feet in<br/> diameter, and about thrity
                    feet perpendicular<br/> height.</p>
<p>The remaining eight small circles represent<br/> mounds which are from eighty to
                    one hundred feet<br/> in diameter, and from twenty-five to thirty feet<br/>
                    perpendicular height, being also globular figures,<br/> and all covered with
                    lofty timber. The semi-<br/>circle (C) is a bank of earth thrown up to the<br/>
                    height of about three feet, its diameter about<br/> one hundred and fifty
                    feet.</p>
<p>Near the outer banks of this extraordinary<br/> fortification are many large
                    holes in the earth,<br/> at least one hundred feet in diameter, and of<br/>
                    considerable depth. These are no doubt places<br/> out of which the earth was in
                    part taken for<br/> making this work of labor.</p>
<p>The land through which we have passed to-<br/>day, is a continuation of a
                    country, very level <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_031" n="31"></pb> and beautiful, being situated on <geogname key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogname>;<br/> the soil, the same in appearance
                    as that de-<br/>scribed yesterday, nothing seeming to indicate<br/> its superior
                    richness, unless it be the size of its<br/> timber. The heaviest and most
                    towering trees<br/> we have seen, we met with to-day. Our progress<br/> was
                    impeded by our curiosity to take the girth<br/> of many trees; we measured white
                    oaks<br/> which were from seven to eight feet in diameter;<br/> walnuts, six to
                    seven feet four inches; elms, six<br/> to six feet eight inches; ash, five feet,
                    and<br/> honey locusts four feet in diameter; the girths<br/> taken eight feet
                    above the surface of the earth.<br/> These trees carried their thickness to an
                    amazing<br/>height.</p>
<p>We also measured a few sycamore trees, and<br/> most of them were from eight to
                    ten feet in<br/> diameter; one of the sycamores we measured<br/> which was eight
                    feet in diameter, continued its<br/> thickness forty-five feet without a limb,
                    its top<br/> very branching and large. While we were admir-<br/>ing it,
                        <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>* suggested an opinion<br/>
                    that this tree, could it be split into cord-wood<br/> after the common manner,
                    would measure forty<br/> cords. At first we questioned the statement,<br/> but
                    upon making a calculation, became con-<br/>vinced that his estimate was within
                    bounds. </p>
<p>These were not trees singled out as the only<br/> monuments; we turned not aside
                    to search for<br/> them, but measured such as fell under our own<br/>observation
                    in passing over our road. It is more<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_032" n="32"></pb> than probable that there
                    are trees in the same<br/> tract larger than any we saw. Few settlements<br/>
                    are yet made here. </p>

<p>Rode seventeen miles, and reached the<br/> residence of our friend <a href="/people/wlupt1">William Lupton<persname key="wlupt1"></persname></a>, upon<br/>
<geogname key="lee">Lee's Creek</geogname>, one of the head waters of <geogname key="paintc">Paint<br/> Creek</geogname>. Our road led us eight times across
                        <geogname key="paintc">Paint<br/> Creek</geogname>; passing a great part of
                    the way through<br/> the bottoms of <geogname key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogname>. The land the same<br/> in appearance as remarked
                    yesterday. In the<br/> course of our ride, we saw many hundreds of<br/> poplars
                    which were the more observable, as we<br/> have scarcely noticed a poplar since
                    we crossed<br/> the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>. These trees are
                    generally seven to<br/> eight feet six inches in diameter, many of them<br/>
                    continuing their thickness for fifty feet in height,<br/> and very handsome and
                    sound. On the bot-<br/>toms we saw deer in abundance; they were<br/> so gentle
                    as to allow us to pass by them<br/> quite within gun shot. They appeared to
                    be<br/> busy in cropping the young grass. We have<br/> also observed several
                    mounds and fortifications<br/> near the falls to <geogname key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogname>, and others nearly<br/> adjacent of which the banks are
                    about three and<br/> a half feet high.</p>
<p>Upon this <geogname key="paintc">Creek</geogname> there are many beaver<br/>
                    dams, and beavers are still caught here by the<br/> Indians. For several days
                    past we have seen<br/> many hunting camps but no Indians. Several<br/> families
                    of Friends have settled in this remote<br/> quarter of the Western Territory.
                    They have<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_033" n="33"></pb>removed from <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/ncaro">North Carolina<placename key="ncaro"></placename></a>,
                    and<br/> expect to be followed by others. They tell us<br/> that an indulged
                    meeting is held in one of their<br/> houses.</p>
<p>There is much to induce Friends of the South-<br/>ern States, to remove to this
                    new country; for,<br/> added to the consideration of the superior quality<br/>
                    of the land, and the cheap and easy terms upon<br/> which it is to be purchased,
                    there is an invalu-<br/>able regulation in the Constitution of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, pro-<br/>hibiting the introduction of slaves.
                    The Con-<br/>stitution has also provided that no person with-<br/>in the State
                    shall voluntarily relinquish his right<br/> to freedom. Its framers have even
                    gone further;<br/> they declare that they have made these regula-<br/>tions to
                    be binding both upon them and upon<br/>their posterity.</p>
<p>This truly valuable country is forbidden ground<br/> to the <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a> slave holders. Many of them<br/> have
                    approached as near to its borders as they<br/> have dared, by settling along the
                    east shore of<br/> the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname>; their
                    murmurs induced several<br/> persons in the State of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, to offer themselves<br/> as candidates to the late State
                    Legislature, de-<br/>claring their determination to use their influence<br/> in
                    obtaining an alteration in this part of the<br/> Constitution. We are told that
                    on account of<br/> this avowal, they met with the most pointed and<br/> zealous
                    opposition; the people declaring gene-<br/>rally, that one of the inducements
                    which led<br/> them to emigrate to the State, was the Constitu-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_034" n="34"></pb>tional provision by which slavery was interdicted,<br/> and that any
                    alteration therein would be an in-<br/>supportable grievance.</p>

<a href="/people/hevan1">Hugh Evan's<persname key="hevan1"></persname></a>, upon <geogname key="clearc">Clear

                    The<br/> country through which we have passed is up-<br/>land and lies level.
                    The timber is heavy and<br/> much interspersed with blue ash, hackberry,<br/>
                    walnut and sugar trees. There is scarcely a set-<br/>tlement yet made here.</p>

<p>Our progress has been impeded for<br/> several days past, two of our horses
                    belonging<br/> to our company having faltered. This day we<br/> concluded to
                    rest them by continuing at the<br/> house of <a href="/people/hevan1">Hugh
                        Evans<persname key="hevan1"></persname></a>, who is hearty and cheerful<br/> at seventy-four years of
                    age, his wife equally<br/> so, and seventy-two years of age. The old man<br/>
                    appears to make me welcome at his house, say-<br/>ing he knew my father, having
                    early in life been<br/> his neighbor, and has made many inquiries after<br/> the
                    families of the people who were his old ac-<br/>quaintance. He says he has six
                    children, all of<br/> whom have married to his satisfaction, and that<br/> they
                    lately removed with him from <a href="/places/kentu">Kentucky<placename key="kentu"></placename></a>,<br/>
                    and are settled around him, each of them upon<br/> five hundred acres of land
                    which he has given<br/> them. He says that it affords him great
                    conso-<br/>lation now in the decline of life, to reflect that<br/> his
                    acquisitions are the fruits of his honest in-<br/>dustry.</p>

<p>This day rode twenty-three miles, and<br/> lodged at <a href="/places/sewec">Sewell's Cabin<placename key="sewec"></placename></a>,-a day of snow and<br/> rain. We crossed the
                    ridge which divides the<br/> waters of the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname> from those of the <geogname key="littlemr">Little<br/>
                        Miami river</geogname>. Passed several of the head<br/> branches of the
                    latter, as also a considerable<br/> creek called the <geogname key="eastf">East
                        Fork</geogname> of the <geogname key="littlemr">Little
                    Miami</geogname>.<br/> On one of the bottoms of the creek we noticed a<br/>
                    fortification. The bank cast up around was about<br/> four feet high. We also
                    observed within a few<br/> rods several mounds. It is truly a beautiful<br/>
                    country through which we have passed to-day;<br/> the land is level, covered
                    with lofty timber, and<br/> the soil very rich, scarcely a settlement yet<br/>
                    made.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-23">23d.</date><placename key="wains"></placename></dateline>
<p>Continued our journey, and after riding<br/> fourteen miles, reached the house of
                        <a href="/people/slint1">Samuel Linton<persname key="slint1"></persname></a>, at <a href="/places/wains">Wainsville<placename key="wains"></placename></a>, upon the <geogname key="littlemr">Little
                        Miami<br/> river</geogname>, where we were kindly received. At this<br/>
                    place we rested ourselves and horses, acquired<br/> information respecting our
                    future route, and<br/> equipped ourselves for the increasing difficulties<br/>
                    of the wilderness.</p>
<p>The settlement made here is composed cheifly<br/> of Friends; about thirty
                    families reside in this<br/> neighborhood. A Monthly Meeting is held<br/> here
                    called <a href="/organizations/miamm">Miami Monthly Meeting<orgname key="miamm"></orgname></a>, to which<br/> about
                    thirty families more belong who are scat-<br/>tered over an extensive tract of
                    country.</p>
<p>Our attention was attracted to-day by the ap-<br/>pearance of the stone, not only
                    in the beds of<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_036" n="36"></pb> the rivers and creeks, but also upon the
                    hills<br/> and in the valleys. They are limestone, and are<br/> composed
                    altogether of marine shells. The stone<br/> when broken discovers the size and
                    shape of the<br/>shells very perfectly.</p>
<p>These shells are of the same description with<br/> those I have formerly obtained
                    from the banks<br/> of the <geogname key="chesab">Chesapeake Bay</geogname>, in
                    the lower part of the<br/> State of <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>.
                    It may be remarked, that<br/> no shell-fish of this description are at present
                    to<br/> be found in any of the waters of our Continent.</p>
<p>The country west of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname> through<br/>
                    which we have passed is a limestone country,<br/> the very pebbles and even sand
                    in many places<br/> are limestone.</p>
<p>Heretofore I have omitted to mention that in<br/> the neighborhood of <a href="/places/chill">Chilicothe<placename key="chill"></placename></a>, we amused our-<br/>selves with the
                    earths and stones, which were<br/> dug out of the ground in sinking wells.
                    There<br/> are several layers or strata of limestone, gravel,<br/> and sand,
                    within a few feet of the surface of the<br/> earth. Some of the stones contain
                    the above<br/> description of marine shells, and in breaking<br/> some of the
                    large gravel we found appearances<br/> of the same shells. The stones as well as
                    the<br/> gravel have evident marks of their having been<br/> washed with water,
                    their shape inclining greatly<br/> to rotundity.</p>

<p>Again proceeded upon our journey, and<br/> after riding eight miles reached
                        <a href="/places/dayt">Dayton<placename key="dayt"></placename></a>, where<br/> we lodged. This town is
                    newly laid out, situ-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_037" n="37"></pb>ated upon the <geogname key="gmiam">Great
                        Miami river</geogname>, nearly op-<br/>posite to the junction of <geogname key="stillr">Still Water</geogname> and <geogname key="madr">Mad<br/>
                        river</geogname>, with the <geogname key="gmiam">Miami</geogname>, which is
                    here about one<br/> hundred and sixty feet in width. We have<br/> passed to day
                    the Ridge which divides the waters<br/> of the <geogname key="littlemr">Little</geogname> and <geogname key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogname>, and
                    crossed<br/> several of the streams belonging to the <geogname key="gmiam">Great<br/> Miami</geogname>. The tract of country between the<br/> two,
                    through which we have passed to-day,<br/> is of the most beautiful and desirable
                    de-<br/>scription. The land lies in waves of great regu-<br/>larity, is crossed
                    with heavy towering timber,<br/> and the soil inexhaustibly rich. At <a href="/places/dayt">Dayton<placename key="dayt"></placename></a><br/> were two block houses, which were erected
                    by<br/> the white men, as places of retreat and defence<br/> against an attack
                    by the Indians.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-25">25th.</date><placename key="staunt"></placename></dateline>
<p>Rode twenty-one miles, and reached a<br/> small village called <a href="/places/staunt">Staunton<placename key="staunt"></placename></a>, situated upon the<br/>
<geogname key="gmiam">Great Miami river</geogname>. The country continues
                    to<br/> exhibit a beautiful appearance, though the tim<br/>ber is not generally
                    so heavy as noted yesterday.<br/> We passed several extensive and rich
                    prairies,<br/> and forded <geogname key="madr">Mad river</geogname> a little
                    above its mouth.<br/> The river derives its name from its swift current.<br/> We
                    also crossed several streams belonging to the<br/>
<geogname key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogname>.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-03-26">26th</date>.<placename key="flino"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day after riding fifteen miles, we<br/> reached <a href="/places/flino">Flinn's ordinary<placename key="flino"></placename></a>, where we were disap-<br/>pointed in finding
                    no feed for our horses. We<br/> also received the information that there was
                    no<br/> probability of our obtaining provision for them<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_038" n="38"></pb> short
                    of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>; we therefore despatched<br/> a
                    part of our company to a house we had passed<br/> about four miles, in quest of
                    corn. They obtained<br/> four bushels, and hired a man and horse to travel<br/>
                    with us and bring the corn along. For many<br/> days past our horses have
                    suffered for want of<br/> hay, and being fed altogether upon corn they<br/> have
                    lost their appetites.</p>
<p>The face of the country in the course of this<br/> day's short journey is a
                    continuation of beautiful<br/> land; being level, and finely timbered. We<br/>
                    passed through a handsome prairie containing<br/> several hundred acres called
                    the Lower <geogname key="piquap">Piqua<br/> Plain</geogname>, crossed <geogname key="honeyc">Honey Creek</geogname> and <geogname key="lostc">Lost
                        Creek</geogname>,<br/> two considerable streams of the <geogname key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogname>.</p>
<p>Thus far in our route we have been favored<br/>with respect to the waters, no
                    rain having fallen<br/> lately to raise the creeks and rivers to a height<br/>
                    sufficient to detain us. In fording some of the<br/> streams we have thought
                    that even six inches<br/> greater depth would take our horses off their
                    feet.<br/> There is considerable danger in fording many of<br/> the streams we
                    have passed, from the uneveness<br/> of the stony bottoms of the rivers. The
                    beds of<br/> the rivers are mostly limestone, and being worn<br/> smooth by the
                    washing of the water, horses are apt<br/> to fall. This was to-day the case with
                    my horse in<br/> fording the <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>, from which
                    accident I got<br/> very wet. </p>
<p>During our detention here this afternoon, we<br/> observed a flock of birds
                    alighting from the trees,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_039" n="39"></pb> different in appearance from any we
                    had seen.<br/> Our landlord informed us they were parrots, and<br/> that they
                    were common upon the <geogname key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogname>;<br/> and to
                    gratify our curiosity he shot one. It was<br/> about the size of a dove, and its
                    plumage resem-<br/>bled the green parrot of South America, the<br/> head red,
                    and the wings tipped with the same<br/> color, the tail long and the bill and
                    tongue of<br/> the same description as the chattering parrot.<br/> As they
                    alighted from the trees, they made a<br/> hoarse noise resembling the chattering
                    of the<br/> common parrot.</p>
<p>There is also a woodcock here resembling the<br/> red headed woodcock of
                        <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>, except that<br/> its head is
                    black and its bill ivory.</p>
<p>At this place <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> erected a<br/>
                    fortification when on his march against the In-<br/>dians, a part of which is
                    now standing. Our<br/> landlord occupies one of the houses which was<br/> at
                    that time built and enclosed within the stock-<br/>ade. From the late period in
                    the day at which<br/> our supply of corn arrived for the horses, we<br/> have
                    concluded to remain at our quarters; the<br/> landlord tells us we shall be
                    welcome to sleep<br/> upon his floor, and has promised to make us a<br/> good
                    fire to sleep by. </p>
<p>This is a kind of lodgment to which we have<br/> become well accustomed, having
                    heretofore in<br/> our journey often had to wrap ourselves in our<br/> blankets
                    and to lie upon floors, always observing<br/> the necessary precaution of laying
                    our feet to the<br/> fire; we have in no instance taken cold.</p>

<p>This day rode fourteen miles, and on<br/> our way passed a larger prairie than
                    the one we<br/> saw yesterday, which is called the Upper <geogname key="piquap">Piqua<br/> Plains</geogname>. We have also passed a body of land<br/>
                    heavily timbered, but its very level situation<br/> renders it not desirable.
                    Through this tract we<br/> have found a very deep and miry road, and<br/> have
                    regretted the neccesity of a slow movement.<br/> Our hired man has to lead his
                    horse, the bag of<br/> corn being too heavy for the horse to bear his<br/>
                    weight also. We reached a place called Lora-<br/>mier's store, where we found a
                    shelter and<br/> lodged, having through the latter part of the<br/> day rode
                    through rain. On our way we twice<br/> crossed a considerable water of the
                        <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname> called<br/>
<geogname key="lorac">Loramier's Creek</geogname>.</p>
<p>At this place there is a very large fortification<br/> made by <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> called <a href="/places/floram">Fort
                        Loramier<placename key="floram"></placename></a>.<br/> And here it is that the line of division
                    between<br/> the white people and the Indians passes agree-<br/>ably to the
                    treaty of peace* <note rend="asterisk">*Treaty of Greenville, for which see
                        Appendix.</note> between the Indians<br/> and <a href="/people/gwayn1">General
                        Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>. I may here remark that<br/> for many days in passing
                    along, we have ob-<br/>served hunting camps erected by the Indians,<br/> but no
                    Indians in them.</p>
<p>It is probable they are at present at or near<br/> their towns. We have observed
                    from day to<br/> day many curious, and to us unitelligible In-<br/>dian
                    hieroglyphics cut upon the trees. We have<br/> also been entertained in
                    examining these figures,<br/> sometimes cut, at other times painted on the
                    <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_041" n="41"></pb>wood after cutting away the bark, the figures of<br/> elks,
                    the horns of the elk, the figures of buffaloes,<br/> bears, wolves, deer,
                    raccoons, and various other<br/> wild beasts, and birds of different species;
                    turtles<br/> and reptile creatures; also the representation of<br/> men, women
                    and children, boys with bows and<br/> arrows shooting game, and men with
                    their<br/> guns aiming at game, or in the act of pursuing<br/> it, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
<p>As a testimony in favor of the virtue and<br/> modesty of these men of the woods,
                    I note, that<br/> we have not yet observed amongst this variety<br/> of figures,
                    one unchaste representation.</p>

<p>Rode twenty-two miles through a flat<br/> country, heavily timbered; at night we
                    encamped<br/> in the woods, made a large fire, fared sumptu-<br/>ously upon wild
                    pigeons, wrapped ourselves in<br/> our blankets and slept soundly. Our
                    pigeons<br/> were shot by one of our company who carries a<br/> gun. There are
                    at this time vast numbers of<br/> this fowl scattered over the woods. They
                    breed<br/> here undisturbedly. Squirrels are also very<br/> numerous. We now and
                    then see a few deer.<br/> They are not plenty here. Wolves, opossums,<br/>
                    reaccoons, and some other descriptions of wild<br/> game are abundant. We have
                    not yet seen a<br/> bear, though they are very plenty throughout<br/> the region
                    we have passed over. This is owing<br/> to a remarkable fact in the history of
                    this crea-<br/>ture. They betake themselves to dens in the<br/> holes of trees,
                    at an early period of the winter,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_042" n="42"></pb> where they remain till the
                        <date when="1804-04-01">1st of the 4th month</date>.<br/> During this
                    interval they never leave their holes,<br/> and as they lay up no store for the
                    winter sup-<br/>ply, it is certain they live without eating. The<br/> Indians
                    say they live by sucking their paws.<br/> The means by which their lives are
                    supported<br/> in their recluse situation, I shall not undertake<br/> to
                    determine. I shall however observe that when<br/> taken from their dens they are
                    always very fat.<br/> We have met with much of their meat, and can<br/> assert
                    that we have seen the thickness of four<br/> inches of fat between the skin and
                    the lean which<br/> covers the ribs. During the winter the Indians<br/> find the
                    bears by searching for their dens in the<br/> trees, which they know by the
                    marks made by<br/> the claws of the bear in climbing.</p>
<p>We have now reached the waters of the lakes,<br/> having to day forded one of the
                    forks of the <geogname key="stmar">St.<br/> Mary's river</geogname>. On our way
                    we passed for a few<br/> miles along a road one hundred feet wide, cut<br/> by
                        <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne's<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> army for transporting
                    pro-<br/>visions from the <geogname key="gmiam">great Miami</geogname> to the
                        <geogname key="stmar">St. Mary's<br/> river</geogname>. The road is now
                    grown up with briars<br/> and shrubs.</p>
<p>Shortly after we had made our fire, and with<br/> the approach of night we heard
                    at a short dis-<br/>tance from us, a whooping in the woods. We<br/> had reason
                    to believe from the shrill and uncom-<br/>mon whoop, that it was the voice of an
                    Indian,<br/> and having understood that it was a custom<br/> among them when
                    about to approach a camp, to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_043" n="43"></pb> give notice by a whoop, we failed
                    not to return<br/> the ceremony also by a whoop. In a few mo-<br/>ments two
                    Indian men upon a horse, followed by<br/> two women and a girl upon another
                    horse, rode<br/> up to our camp. Their countenances were smil-<br/>ing and
                    indicative of friendship. As we reached<br/> them our hands, they shook them
                    saying, <said who="undetermined"><foreign xml:lang="del">Saga,<br/> Saga,
                            niches,</foreign></said> which we have since learned was<br/> the
                    salutation, <said>How do you do, brothers.</said> They<br/> could not speak
                    English, but putting their hands<br/> to their breasts expressed, <said who="undetermined"><a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,
                        Dela-<br/>wares,</said> from which we gathered they were<br/>
<a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware Indians<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>. They had their hunting
                    ap-<br/>paratus with them, and pointing several times<br/> to the south, we
                    concluded they wished to make<br/> us understand that their camp was in that
                    direc-<br/>tion, and that they were on their way to it.<br/> After looking upon
                    us for some minutes they<br/> left us.</p>

<p>Very early this morning we again pro-<br/>ceeded, and this day rode thirty miles,
                    a laborious,<br/> fatiguing journey to ourselves and horses. Our<br/> path
                    leading through a flat country we find the<br/> travelling miry and deep. Our
                    horses are to be<br/> pitied, the stock of corn we procured for them<br/> is
                    exhausted, and the only food they can<br/> now get is the grass in the woods.
                    For several<br/> nights past we have turned them loose to graze.<br/> These poor
                    creatures feed around our camps and<br/> appear afraid to leave us.</p>
<p>This day we crossed the <geogname key="stmar">St. Mary's</geogname> where
                    its<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_044" n="44"></pb> width was about one hundred and fifty feet, it is<br/>
                    said to be a very deep river. An old Indian<br/> and his squaw reside here, and
                    he undertook to<br/> ferry us across in a canoe. Our horses swam<br/> the river,
                    and got over well. The old Indian,<br/> whose name is <a href="/people/steph1">Stephen<persname key="steph1"></persname></a>, very unintentionally<br/> swam also. This accident was
                    owing to the mis-<br/>conduct of some of the packers, who, on their<br/> way to
                        <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> with provisions, gave
                        <a href="/people/steph1">Stephen<persname key="steph1"></persname></a><br/> too much whisky. <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> was in the<br/> canoe with him when he
                    accidentely fell over-<br/>board; we were greatly alarmed for his safety,<br/>
                    knowing that he was intoxicated, but after dis-<br/>appearing for a few seconds,
                    he rose to the sur-<br/>face of the water, and soon convinced us that he<br/>
                    could swim. <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> caught him by his
                    blanket,<br/> and got him again into the boat. The old man<br/> laughed very
                    heartily at the accident, saying to<br/> us in broken English, <said who="steph1">No fear, me ferry you<br/> in de canoe yet.</said> Our
                    blacksmith having in-<br/>formed <a href="/people/steph1">Stephen<persname key="steph1"></persname></a> of
                    his expectation of settling in<br/> the Indian country for the benefit of the
                    red<br/> people, and the old man finding also that our<br/> company were all
                    prosecuting their travels for<br/> benevolent purposes, exercised his gratitude
                    by<br/> telling us <said who="steph1">You pay one quarter dollar de man;<br/>
                        nobody keep canoe here but <a href="/people/steph1">Stephen<persname key="steph1"></persname></a>; he
                        make<br/> the white people pay dollar, I make dem packers<br/> pay me de
                        rest.</said> In <a href="/people/steph1">Stephen's<persname key="steph1"></persname></a> hut we
                    observed<br/> several Indians who were asleep. He says they<br/> are Indians who
                    have come a great distance and<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_045" n="45"></pb> are tired. During the greater
                    part of this day<br/> we have rode through a heavy rain. The rain<br/>
                    continuing with the approach of night, we made<br/> a large fire, and erected a
                    shelter in imitation of<br/> the Indian hunting camps, covering it with our<br/>
                    blankets. Under this we slept, and were but<br/> little incommoded,
                    notwithstanding the rain<br/> continued during the greater part of the
                    night.</p>
<p>I must not omit to mention that we to-day<br/> passed through a very level plain
                    containing<br/> many thousand acres. This plain is almost with-<br/>out trees.
                    The soil nearly hid by weeds and<br/> grass of last year's growth; the
                    luxuriance of<br/> which plainly demonstrates its extraordinary fer-<br/>tility.
                    In this plain we observed a small pond<br/> or lake in which were wild geese and
                    ducks in<br/> abundance. We are informed that this is one<br/> of the places
                    where wild fowl raise their young.</p>

<p>Pursued our path and travelled twenty-<br/>three miles through a very fertile,
                    heavily tim-<br/>bered and beautiful country, being a little more<br/> inclined
                    to hills. The ride to-day has been a<br/> pleasing one, in part doubtless from
                    the reflec-<br/>tion that the day would probably close a long,<br/> tedious and
                    arduous journey. We at last reached<br/><a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                        Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>. As we approached the <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,<br/> having reached it within about thirty rods, we<br/>
                    were saluted by a sentinel with the word <said who="undetermined">Halt.</said><br/> We obeyed the command. A sergeant was de-<br/>spatched from
                    the commanding officer, who en-<br/>quired of us on his behalf, <said who="undetermined">Where are you<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_046" n="46"></pb> going,</said> and <said who="undetermined">What is your business.</said> We de-<br/>sired him to
                    inform the commandant that we<br/> were strangers, and that we had an
                    introductory<br/> letter directed to him which would explain our<br/>
                    business.</p>
<p>The officer shortly returned to us with an in-<br/>vitation to advance; we
                    accordingly proceeded,<br/> and were met very politely by the commanding<br/>
                    officer, <a href="/people/awhip1">Capt. Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>, to whom we handed

<p>After delivering this letter we proceeded to<br/> the house of a Canadian trader,
                    who we had pre-<br/>viously been informed would furnish us with<br/>
                    accommodations.</p>
<p>In the evening the Commandant followed us<br/> to our quarters, discovering marks
                    of great re-<br/>spect and attention, and appears to be a gentle-<br/>man. He
                    has urgently pressed us to dine with<br/> him to-morrow, and we have accepted
                    the invi-<br/>tation.</p>

<p>This morning the commanding officer,<br/> accompanied by <a href="/people/jjohn2">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/wwell1">William
                        Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, the two other persons named in the letter<br/> to the
                    Secretary of War, waited upon us. They <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_048" n="48"></pb> expressed to us they
                    were glad to see us, and<br/> invited us with marks of earnestness, each
                    one,<br/> to make his house our home. We thanked them<br/> for their kindness,
                    and accepted the invitation<br/> of the Factor, <a href="/people/jjohn2">John
                        Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a>, whom we accom-<br/>panied to his house.</p>
<p>In an interview with these three persons we<br/> communicated to them more fully
                    the object of<br/> our visit, and consulted with them respecting<br/> the best
                    mode to pursue, in order to effect our<br/> purpose. It was deemed advisable
                    that an ex-<br/>press be sent to the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and to the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                        Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>. The former residing at his town called<br/>
<a href="/places/lturtown">Turtle's Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a>, about eighteen miles from
                    this<br/> place, situated upon <geogname key="eelr">Eel river</geogname>, a
                    water of the<br/><geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, and the latter on the
                    river <geogname key="stjos">St. Joseph</geogname><br/> of <geogname key="lakem">Lake Michigan</geogname>, about forty miles hence, in-<br/>forming them of
                    our arrival at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, and<br/> that we
                    wished to see each of them there at an<br/> early period. This charge <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> readily<br/> took upon himself, and we
                    have no doubt he will<br/> comply with his engagement.</p>
<p>We fulfilled our promise in dining to-day with<br/><a href="/people/awhip1">Capt.
                        Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>, the commanding officer. We<br/> were all accompanied to
                    his house by <a href="/people/jjohn2">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a>, who dined with
                    us. The officer behaved<br/> with a freedom and gentility becoming a well<br/>
                    bred man. After dinner he showed us more<br/> fully the fort. This fortification
                    which was<br/> built by <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>, is

                    army of the<br/> United States, and much of it was formerly done<br/> by the

                    Indian town then at this place contained upwards<br/> of one thousand warriors.

<p>The spot where <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> is situated is
                    ren-<br/>dered famous in Indian history. It was here<br/> that the Indians gave
                    the army of <a href="/people/jharm1">General Har-mar<persname key="jharm1"></persname></a> a second
                    defeat by which several hundred<br/> of his men fell. Their bones lie scattered
                    upon<br/> the surface of the earth, and we are told that<br/> the route by which
                    the army made an escape<br/> can be readily traced for the distance of five

<p>This day is the first day of the<br/> week, and the inhabitants of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> appear<br/> to pay no respect to it. The
                    soldiers are on<br/> duty, and the Canadians who are settled here<br/> are
                    busied with their several occupations. After<br/>breakfast we paid a visit to
                        <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, and<br/> after spending
                    several hours with returned<br/> to our quarters. In the afternoon we
                    observed<br/> three Indians advancing toward our lodgings,<br/> and soon
                    discovered that one of them was the<br/><a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                        Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, the other two were his sons. He<br/> had not heard of our
                    arrival till he reached <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, and
                    the only information he had ob-<br/>tained was that some Quakers had come.
                    Busi-<br/>ness had brought him to the fort. They were<br/> invited into our
                    room, when the chief instantly<br/> recognized us both. He appeared glad to
                    see<br/> us, and shook hands with both of us very hearti<br/>ly. A person being
                    present who understood the<br/><a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>
                    language, he said to him pointing<br/> to me, <said who="undetermined">This is
                        the man who wrote our talks in<br/><a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>.</said></p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_051" n="51"></pb>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> very deliberately and
                    can-<br/>didly replied to our inquiry after his health as<br/> follows: <said who="fmeda1">That in the course of last fall he went<br/> to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, that whilst there the white people<br/>
                        made him drink whiskey. That after he had<br/> accomplished his business
                        there, he set out for<br/> his home, and got upon his horse whilst the<br/>
                        whiskey was in his head. That he had not rode<br/> far before he fell from
                        his horse, and was very<br/> much hurt by the fall, and that ever since
                        that<br/> time he had not been well.</said></p>
<p>After some further mutual inquiries, relative<br/> to the welfare of red and
                    white acquaintance, we<br/> we informed him through an interpreter that we<br/>
                    had come to see our red brethren, that we had<br/> messages for both the
                        <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and himself,<br/> and were
                    glad that it had so happened that we<br/> had come. That we hoped the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/> would come to-morrow, and that we
                    wished to<br/> see them together, having something to say to<br/> them. He
                    appeared pleased with this informa-<br/>tion, and expressed that he had made a
                    camp<br/> not far off, where he would wait for the arrival<br/> of the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>. After some general con-<br/>versation
                    he withdrew, bidding us farewell. </p>

<p>Being invited to dine to-day with<br/><a href="/people/wwell1">William
                        Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, who is interpreter for the In-<br/>dians, we went to his
                    house accordingly, having<br/> the company of our very worthy and kind
                    land-<br/>lord.</p>
<p>About mid-day the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>arrived. He<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_052" n="52"></pb> approached us with a countenance placid be-<br/>yond description;
                    took us by the hand with cor-<br/>diality, and expressed himself in terms of
                    great<br/> gladness at meeting with us. He inquired very<br/> particularly after
                    his friends and acquaintance of<br/><a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, after our own welfare, the path we<br/> had come,
                    and the difficulties we had encoun-<br/>tered on our journey through the
                    wilderness.<br/> Having answered his questions, he replied in<br/> turn to our
                    inquiries as follows: That since he<br/> saw us it had pleased the Great Spirit
                    to take<br/> away two of his brothers and a nephew. That<br/> his nephew was the
                        <a href="/people/toad1">Toad<persname key="toad1"></persname></a>, a young chief who<br/> was with him
                    in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. That he died on<br/> his
                    return from that visit, and within a few miles<br/> of home, of which
                    circumstances he had desired<br/><a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>
                    to inform us. That with respect<br/> to himself, he was but half well, having
                    been<br/> very sick last fall and expected to die. That<br/> his white brothers
                    at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, hearing of<br/> his illness,
                    sent a doctor to him who gave him<br/> physic and made him better. That he had
                    now<br/> seen fifty-three winters, and two of his brothers<br/> being dead, made
                    him think of death, and that<br/> his time would soon come.</p>
<p>He also told us that he had left a brother at<br/> his town who would have
                    accompanied him,<br/> being desirous to come with him, but could<br/> not find
                    his horse in time. After this, other<br/> conversation took place of a general
                    nature. The<br/> interpreter informs us that his complaint is the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_053" n="53"></pb> gout, and that in the time of his illness he (the<br/> interpreter)
                    had told him that his complaint be-<br/>longed to great folks and gentlemen.

</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock we dined. At the head of the<br/> table sat the interpreter's
                    wife, who is a modest,<br/> well-looking Indian woman, and the daughter<br/> of
                    a distinguished chief. She had prepared for<br/> us a large well roasted wild
                    turkey, and also a<br/> wild turkey boiled, and for these she had pro-<br/>vided
                    a large supply of cranberry sauce. The<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> sat at table with us, and with<br/> much sociability we
                    all partook of an excellent<br/> dinner.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, attended
                    by<br/> his sons, visited us at <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells'<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>
                    house,<br/> and the opportunity being a suitable one, we<br/> proposed to them
                    that a formal conference should<br/> then take place between us. This
                    proposition<br/> meeting their assent, we opened the conference<br/> by desiring
                    the interpreter to inform them that<br/> we had received their talk sent to us
                    last fall,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_054" n="54"></pb> informing us that the implements of husbandry,<br/>
                    which we had sent to them last year, had come<br/> to them safely, and that we
                    had carefully ob-<br/>served all that was contained in that talk. That<br/> we
                    were deputed by their brothers and friends of<br/><a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> to come to see them. That we had<br/> accordingly
                    come, and had with us a letter di-<br/>rected to them, which we thought ought in
                    the<br/> first place to be read, and after that we might<br/> have something to
                    say to them. A short pause<br/> having taken place, they expressed a desire
                    that<br/> the letter should be read, which was accordingly<br/> done, and
                    interpreted to them as follows:</p>

<p>Brothers and Friends.- You observe that<br/> the letter which has just
                            been read, makes men-<br/>tion of four of us appointed to visit you.
                            One<br/> of these was an infirm man who thought he<br/> could not endure
                            the fatigue of so long a jour-<br/>ney, and therefore did not come. The
                            other<br/> did not omit to come for the want of love to his<br/> red
                            brethren; family circumstances rendered it<br/> inconvenient for him to
                            leave home. You see,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_056" n="56"></pb> brothers, that it has pleased the
                            Great Spirit<br/> that two of us mentioned in the letter, should<br/>
                            reach the country of our red brethren. Brothers,<br/> we thought it
                            right in the first place to send for<br/> you, and to show you the
                            letter which has just<br/> been read. We are glad that you are now
                            come,<br/> and that we have this opportunity of taking you<br/> by the
                            hand.</p>
<p>Brothers, we believe that we have some things<br/> to say to you which
                            are of great importance to<br/> our red brothers, to their old men, to
                            their young<br/> men, to their women, and to their children.</p>
<p>Brothers, we may now mention that we have<br/> not come merely to talk,
                            but we hope we have<br/> come prepared to do a little for the welfare
                            of<br/> our red brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers, in looking over our business, we<br/> have thought that we
                            should be glad to have an<br/> opportunity of seeing our red brethren
                            together,<br/> and are willing to propose for your consideration,<br/>
                            that you should now fix upon some place, and<br/> agree upon some time
                            to meet us again, and that<br/> our brothers invite their old men, their
                            young<br/> men, their women and their children to meet us,<br/> when we
                            shall have something to say which it<br/> may not be necessary now to
                            say.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,- Should you think<br/> that the proposal which we
                            have now made is<br/> proper, and conclude to meet us in the manner<br/>
                            we have pointed out, we expect we shall have<br/> but little more to say
                            at present.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>Here a pause <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_057" n="57"></pb> for some minutes took place, when the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> inquired, <said who="lturt1">If
                        the Friends had more to<br/> say.</said> He was answered in the
                    negative.</p>
<p>After a further pause and some conversation<br/> between the two chiefs, they
                    rose from their<br/> seats, and perceiving that they were advancing<br/> toward
                    us, we also arose from our seats. On meet-<br/>ing them, they took us by the
                    hand, and with<br/> countenances indicative of great gravity, shook<br/> hands
                    with us and returned to their seats.</p>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> then commenced a speech<br/> as
                    follows:-</p>
<floatingtext>
<dateline><date when="1804-04-02"></date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends: My friend, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Lit-tle
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, and myself, together with my two<br/> sons, who
                            are present, rejoice to have this oppor-<br/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<br/> hand.</p>
<p>My Brothers: We are glad to be informed,<br/> that you received our talk
                            sent to you last fall,<br/> and to find that you are now come to the
                            country<br/> of your red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends: We rejoice that<br/> the Great Spirit has
                            conducted you safely to our<br/> country, and figure to ourselves that
                            in you we<br/> see the rest of our brothers and friends of <a href="/places/balti1">Balti-more<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, and that in taking you by
                            the hand, we<br/> take them by the hand.</p>
<p>Brothers: We know that you have come a<br/> long distance to see the
                            situation of your red<br/> brethren. We have no doubt that you have<br/>
                            things to say which are of great importance to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_058" n="58"></pb>us, and which do not belong to a few only but<br/> to many. </p>
<p>Brothers: Your brethren the Indians do<br/> business not as the white
                            people do. We con-<br/>vene our chiefs, and things of importance
                            are<br/> considered by them. But, brothers, you have<br/> come to see
                            the situation of your red brethren.<br/> It is our wish that you should
                            see it. You shall<br/> not be disappointed. The proposal you have<br/>
                            made to us we think right, and have concluded<br/> that this place
                                (<a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,) is the best
                            place<br/> to be fixed upon for the purpose you wish. We<br/> are
                            pleased to find that you have a desire that<br/> our young men should be
                            present to hear what<br/> you have to say, and as it is your wish to see
                            our<br/> women and children, we desire that you may<br/> have an
                            opportunity of seeing them.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends: Our young men are<br/> out hunting, and our women
                            and children are<br/> now at work at their sugar camps. The time is<br/>
                            not far off when they will all return to our<br/> towns, when it is
                            usual to meet together. We<br/> hope, brothers, that you will not be in
                            a hurry,<br/> but will allow us time to collect our people
                            to-<br/>gether.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>Here a pause took place, when we inquired if<br/> they had any thing further to
                    add. And being<br/> answered in the negative, we addressed them<br/> again in
                    substance as follows:</p>
<floatingtext>
<dateline><date when="1804-04-02"></date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends: When we left our <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_059" n="59"></pb> homes, we knew
                            it was early in the season, and<br/> expected that we should ge to the
                            country of<br/> our red brethren at a time when their young<br/> men,
                            their women and children would be busy.<br/> But brothers, a part of the
                            service* <note rend="asterisk">*The Friends were desirous that their
                                agricul-<br/>turist, <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                                Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, should arrive amongst the<br/> Indians in time to
                                plant corn. T.</note> which we de-<br/>sign to render to you,
                            required that we should<br/> come early, and makes it also necessary
                            that we<br/> should now be in a hurry.</p>
<p>Brothers: We will also add that when we<br/> were chosen by our friends
                            at home to pay a<br/> visit to our red brethren, our women and
                            chil-<br/>dren consented that we should leave them, but<br/> charged us
                            that we should not stay away from<br/> them longer than circumstances
                            really required.<br/> A long time has already past since we left
                            them,<br/> we therefore hope, brothers, that in three or four<br/> days
                            it will be in your power to get together<br/> some of your people. Those
                            that are far from<br/> home we do not wish that you should send for.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> then observed that the
                    res-<br/>sons we had given were good. The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                        Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a><br/> next remarked that at the time proposed, they<br/>
                    could easily convene a considerable number of<br/> their indolent people, who
                    were too lazy to hunt<br/> or make sugar, but such they did not wish us to<br/>
                    see. Their industrious young men and women <br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_060" n="60"></pb>were too far from home to be convened in so<br/> short a time.</p>
<p>Here a short conversation took place between<br/> the chiefs, and afterwards they
                    proposed seven<br/> day's hence as the time; desiring that to-morrow<br/> might
                    not be counted, as it would take them a<br/> day to return home. To this we
                    consented.</p>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> then expressed as follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-02"></date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers, it would have been very desirable<br/> to us if you could have
                            met us at the time of our<br/> counsel. We have very often told our
                            people<br/> of the Quakers. They listen to us, but are at a<br/> loss to
                            know what sort of people the Quakers<br/> are. If you could stay,
                            brothers, they would<br/> have an opportunity of seeing the Quakers,
                            and<br/> of hearing words from your own mouths.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>After this the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> added:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-02"></date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers: We hope the words that you<br/> may say to us at the time we
                            have appointed to<br/> meet will be upon paper. From that paper we<br/>
                            can at some future time have your words de-<br/>livered to our people.
                            This, brothers, will in some<br/> measure answer the end.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>During a pause which occupied several<br/> minutes we asked them if we understood
                    each<br/> other. The <a href="/people/lturt1">Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> replied, <said who="lturt1">Yes, perfectly; we<br/> have nothing further to do now than to
                        look for-<br/>ward to the day appointed.</said></p>
<p>After this we took each other by the hand<br/> and very cordially bade farewell.
                    We then re-<br/>turned to our lodgings.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_061" n="61"></pb>
<p>In the evening we again had the company of<br/> the chiefs, they having been
                    invited by our<br/> landlord to take supper with us.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-03">3d.</date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day rainy, and spent chiefly at<br/><a href="/people/wwell1">William
                        Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>'.</p>
<p>Besides the garrison stationed here, there is a<br/> large store of goods
                    established by the United<br/> States, for the purpose of suppplying the
                    Indians.<br/> The store is kept by our landlord. Several<br/> Canadian traders
                    also reside here, who exchange<br/> goods with the Indians; some of them have
                    re-<br/>sided here for more than thirty years. The In-<br/>dians are daily
                    arriving with their peltry, some<br/> of them exchange them for goods, others
                    re-<br/>quire money. The women bring sugar, which<br/> is generally neatly
                    packed in a square box made<br/> of bark, containing about fifty pounds. It
                    is<br/> made from the sugar tree. This art has long<br/> been known to the
                    Indians. They make and<br/> use large quantities of sugar. We have seen<br/>
                    very white and clear looking sugar of their manu-<br/>facture.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">

<p>Rode about two miles up the <geogname key="stmar">St. Mary's<br/>
                        river</geogname> and viewed the remains of old Indian<br/> houses, also the
                    fields on which they cultivated<br/> corn, where the corn hills are still
                    discernible.<br/> We also observed large numbers of Indian graves.<br/> These
                    are now discernible only by the sunken<br/> cavities in the surface of the
                    earth. In the<br/> course of our route we have seen many Indian<br/> graves of
                    more recent date. They bury their <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_062" n="62"></pb> dead about three feet below
                    the surface of the<br/> earth; and over the grave they either place a<br/> heap
                    of stones or a pen of logs. If the de-<br/>ceased has been a person of
                    distinction, they<br/> plant posts at the head and foot which they
                    orna-<br/>ment very curiously.</p>
<p>In a review of the many circumstantial evi-<br/>dences which have fallen under
                    our observation<br/> of the former population of this western world,<br/> I am

<p>Spent the day with <a href="/people/wwell1">Captain Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>. We
                    walked with him up the <geogname key="stjos">St. Joseph's<br/> river</geogname>,
                    and were shown the ground upon which<br/> the Indians under the command of the
                        <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> defeated a part of the
                    United States army<br/> under <a href="/people/jharm1">General Harmar<persname key="jharm1"></persname></a>,
                    killing 300 out 500<br/> men. We also followed for a considerable dis-<br/>tance
                    the route which the soldiers took in their<br/> retreat, and saw many of their
                    bones. Amongst<br/> these were skulls which had marks of the<br/> tomahawk and
                    scalping knife. Many of them<br/> had fallen on the east bank of the river,
                    and<br/> also within the river. The Indians being sta-<br/>tioned behind trees
                    on the west side shot them<br/> in their attempt to get across.</p>
<p>We were shown the tree behind which the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_063" n="63"></pb>
<a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> took his station, as also a tree
                    near<br/> it behind which <a href="/people/toad1">his nephew<persname key="toad1"></persname></a> fell. This
                    was a<br/> second defeat, the United States troops having<br/> been routed the
                    day before on <geogname key="eelr">Eel river</geogname>.</p>
</div>

<p>Spent the day in the neighborhood of<br/>
<a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, in the course of which we visited<br/>
<a href="/people/awhip1">Captain Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>. This afternoon several
                    In-<br/>dians from different tribes arrived, bringing<br/> with them skins and
                    furs. These are mostly<br/> brought by the women upon their backs, the<br/> men
                    thinking it sufficient to carry their guns<br/> and hunting equipments.</p>
<p>We saw this evening a white woman, who,<br/> when a small girl, had been taken
                    captive, and<br/> has ever since lived amongst the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowatamy tribe<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> of Indians. She tells us (through an
                    in-<br/>terpreter) that she has no knowledge of the<br/> part of the country
                    from which she was taken,<br/> nor of her family. That she remembers her
                    name<br/> was Dolly, which is the only distinct recollec-<br/>tion she retains
                    of herself previous to her cap-<br/>tivity. This woman is dressed in Indian
                    habit,<br/> is painted after the Indian order, and has so<br/> effectually
                    adopted Indian manners, that a nice<br/> observer would not discover from
                    external ob-<br/>servation her origin, except from the color of<br/> her eyes,
                    which are grey.</p>

                    way we passed several sugar camps, at which<br/> were Indian women and children
                    who were em-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_064" n="64"></pb>ployed in making sugar. Their huts were large,<br/>
                    and covered with the bark of the Buck Eye<br/> wood. Their troughs for catching
                    the sugar<br/> water as it is called, are made of the bark of the<br/> red elm,
                    they are made thin, and the ends tied<br/> together. We were shown the places
                    where<br/> stood the houses of several distinguished char-<br/>acters amongst
                    the Indians. <a href="/people/wwell1">Captain Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> also<br/> took us
                    to the ground, where the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/>
                    reviewed his men, and gave them their orders<br/> before going against the army
                    of <a href="/people/gstcl1">General St. Clair<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>. It is an extensive
                    plain near the river.<br/><a href="/people/wwell1">Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> was then one
                    of the number, and says the<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>
                    had one thousand four hundred<br/> men; <a href="/people/gstcl1">St.
                        Clair's<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a> army consisted of a much larger<br/> number, and were
                    about fifty miles distant at<br/> the time. The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> divided his men<br/> into bands or messes, to each mess
                    twenty men.<br/> It was the business of four of this number alter-<br/>nately to
                    hunt for provisions. At 12 o'clock<br/> each day it was the duty of the hunters
                    to re-<br/>turn to the army with what they had killed. By<br/> this regulation,
                    his warriors were well supplied<br/> with provisions, during the seven day's in
                    which<br/> they were advancing from this place to the field<br/> of battle. It
                    is well known that at day break<br/> the Indians commenced an unexpected
                    attack<br/> upon <a href="/people/gstcl1">St. Clair's<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a> forces, killed
                    nine hundred of<br/> his men, and put his whole army to flight.<br/><a href="/people/wwell1">Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> says, that only about thirty Indians were<br/>
                    killed in the battle, and that about twenty died <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_065" n="65"></pb> afterwards of
                    their wounds. He also related<br/> the following anecdote:</p>
<p>A considerable altercation arose amongst the<br/> Indians on the review ground,
                    relative to a<br/> Commander-in-Chief. Some were in favor of<br/>
<a href="/people/buckon1">Buckangehelas<persname key="buckon1"></persname></a>, a principal chief amongst the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, whilst others were in favor of the<br/>
<a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>. At length <a href="/people/buckon1">Buckangehelas<persname key="buckon1"></persname></a> himself<br/> decided the controversy
                    by yielding to the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, saying
                    that he was the youngest and most<br/> active man, and that he preferred him to
                    him-<br/>self. This reconciled the parties, and the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> took the command.</p>
<p>We also rode to view a prairie which extends<br/> from the <geogname key="stmar">St. Mary's river</geogname> to the <geogname key="little">Little
                        river</geogname>, a<br/> branch of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>. The distance from one<br/> to the other is not more than
                    four miles, and<br/> the highest ground is not more than five feet<br/> above
                    the water in either river. The Indians<br/> say that in high freshets they have
                    passed from<br/> one water to the other in their canoes. A canal<br/> might
                    easily be cut here, and at a small expense,<br/> by which the waters of the
                    lakes and the waters<br/> of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, (and of
                    course the <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>)<br/> would be
                    connected. An abundance of furs<br/> and skins taken on the waters of the
                        <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> and<br/> the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, are brought up the latter river in<br/> boats by the
                    Canadians and the Indians, and<br/> thence taken across a portage of eight miles
                    to<br/> the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> of the Lakes,* <note rend="asterisk">*The <geogname key="maume">Maumee river</geogname>.</note>
                    whence they are<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_066" n="66"></pb> again conveyed by water to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>; goods suit-<br/>able for the Indian trade are also
                    transported<br/> back again by the same route.</p>
<p>After spending some time in viewing the re-<br/>mains of several old Indian
                    towns, graves, hiero-<br/>glyphics, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., we returned to
                        <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>' house, where we dined,
                    and in the even-<br/>ing returned to our lodgings.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-08">8th</date>.<placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Paid a visit to the carpenter and black-<br/>smith who accompanied us as before
                    mentioned.<br/> They are both at work. The blacksmith is re-<br/>pairing Indian
                    guns, and the carpenter is at<br/> work upon a council house which the
                    govern-<br/>ment has ordered to be built for the Indians at<br/> their request.
                    The house is to be built of hewn<br/> logs, fifty feet in length, and
                    twenty-five in width.<br/> We also amused ourselves in attending to the<br/>
                    manner of packing furs and skins. Our friend<br/> Jonathan has several Canadians
                    now employed<br/> in that business. They are packed by a ma-<br/>chine
                    constructed for the purpose, by which the<br/> work is performed expeditiously.
                    The packs<br/> are made in squares of about two and a half feet,<br/> and
                    contain from thirty-five to forty deer skins,<br/> or about two hundred raccoon
                    skins.</p>

<p>On the evening of this day, we received<br/> a message from the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, informing us<br/> that the Indians
                    had arrived, and that they<br/> would be ready to meet us at 10 o'clock the
                    next<br/> morning.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-10">4th mo. 10th.</date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>At 10 o'clock this morning we <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_067" n="67"></pb> proceeded to <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>', who, as we before<br/> observed, is
                    interpreter for the Indians. We<br/> were accompanied by our friend <a href="/people/jjohn2">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/awhip1">Captain
                        Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>, <persname>Lieutenants Campbell</persname>
                        and<br/><persname>Simms</persname>, and several other reputable persons,
                    and<br/> were met by the following chiefs:</p>
<p><a href="/people/obass1">O-bas-se-a, (or the Fawn,)<persname key="obass1"></persname></a> a village chief
                    of<br/> great distinction in the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>
                    nation.</p>
<p><a href="/people/osso1">Os-so-mit<persname key="osso1"></persname></a>, a village chief of the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a><br/> nation, and brother to the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p><a href="/people/lturt1">Me-she-ke-na-que<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, or the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, a war<br/> chief of the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> nation.</p>
<p>They were attended by a considerable num-<br/>ber of their principal young men,
                    and by several<br/> women.</p>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> was not present. He had<br/>
                    informed us on taking leave, that circumstances<br/> required him to return to
                    his town, and that the<br/> distance would be too great for him to return
                    in<br/> time to meet us, his infirmities occasioning him<br/> to travel slowly,
                    but that he would send his<br/> brother, who would report to him faithfully
                    all<br/> the proceedings of the council.</p>
<p>After we had taken each other by the hand,<br/> the chiefs took their seats by
                    the side of each<br/> other. Their principal people next seated them-<br/>selves
                    according to the rank or distinction which<br/> they held. After them, their
                    young men in<br/> circular order, seat after seat,- and lastly, the<br/> women,-
                    who occupied seats separate from the<br/> men, being placed near the centre of
                    the room.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_068" n="68"></pb>
<p>We took our seats on the opposite side of the<br/> house and in front of the
                    Indians.</p>
<p>Being all thus seated- I speak literally, when<br/> I say my heart palpitated- I
                    felt the importance<br/> and dignity of our mission; I wished our heads<br/>
                    were wiser, and feared for the result of so in-<br/>teresting an
                    opportunity.</p>
<p>After a few minutes had passed, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> observed, that when we met before, they<br/> had informed
                    us of the difficulty there was in<br/> convening the Indians at so early a
                    period in<br/> the season, and that those of their people then<br/> present with
                    him were all who were likely to<br/> attend to listen to what we had to say.</p>
<p>We then proposed that the letter from our<br/> friends and brothers at home, read
                    to the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> and the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> at the time of our<br/> first meeting,
                    should be again read for the in-<br/>formation of our Indian brethren now
                    attend-<br/>ing.</p>
<p>This proposal was deemed proper, and the<br/> letter was accordingly read.</p>
<p>After a short pause, we addressed them as<br/> follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-10"></date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends: We know that the<br/> most of our Red Brethren are,
                            at present, at<br/> their hunting and sugar camps, and did not
                            ex-<br/>pect to see a large number at so short a notice.<br/> We have,
                            therefore, agreeably to your request,<br/> put upon paper the things we
                            have to say, and<br/> hope you will not fail to have them communi-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_069" n="69"></pb>cated, when, at some future time, you may be<br/> more

<p>One of us, then standing up, read to them the<br/> following address: The

                            others.</opener>
<p>Brothers and Friends: When we were to-<br/>gether, eight days ago, with
                            the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/> and the
                                <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, the letter was read
                            to<br/> them, which has just been read. That letter,<br/> you observe,
                            says that we were appointed by<br/> the people called <orgname key="bym">Quakers, of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></orgname>, to visit<br/> you, and to take you by
                            the hand on their be-<br/>half, desiring that you would receive any
                            com-<br/>munications from us, as coming immediately<br/> from them.</p>
<p>Brothers: After that letter was read, our<br/> hearts were filled with so
                            much love for our Red<br/> Brethren, that, on looking over and
                            considering<br/> the business upon which we had come, we felt<br/> a
                            desire to see as many together as could be<br/> convened- and this day
                            was that agreed upon<br/> for us to meet you.</p>
<p>Brothers: We believed that the things we<br/> had to say were of great
                            importance to our Red<br/> Brethren, and therefore it was that we
                            request-<br/>ed to see you together, that you all might have<br/> an
                            opportunity of hearing what we have to say.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_070" n="70"></pb>
<p>Brothers: Our hearts are filled with thank-<br/>fulness to the Great
                            Spirit, that He has<br/> brought us safely to the country of our
                            Red<br/> Brethren, and protected us through the journey.<br/> We also
                            rejoice that He has given us this oppor-<br/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<br/> hand.</p>
<p>Brothers: It is now a little more than two<br/> years since your Brothers
                            of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> had an<br/> opportunity
                            of becoming acquainted with the<br/><a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                                Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                                    Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/topin1">Tuthinipee<persname key="topin1"></persname></a>,
                            and<br/> some other chiefs. They were glad of that op-<br/>portunity of
                            having a talk with them, and of<br/> enquiring after the situation of
                            their Red<br/> Brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers: We had for some time entertain-<br/>ed apprehensions, that the
                            many changes which<br/> were taking place in circumstances, must
                            greatly<br/> change the situation of our Red Brethren, and<br/> that the
                            time was fast approaching, in which it<br/> would be necessary for them
                            to alter their mode<br/> of living.</p>
<p>Brothers: After our talk with the chiefs<br/> whom we have just
                            mentioned, we were fully con-<br/>vinced that the time was come, in
                            which our Red<br/> Brethren ought to begin to cultivate their
                            lands;<br/> that they ought to raise corn and other grain,<br/> also
                            horses, cows, sheep, hogs, and other animals.<br/> We then proposed to
                            afford them some assist-<br/>ance. They appeared to be glad of the
                            proposal,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_071" n="71"></pb> and informed that many of their people
                            were<br/> disposed to turn heir attention to the cultiva-<br/>tion of
                            the earth. They also expressed a desire<br/> to be assisted by their
                            Brothers of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>Brothers: Having been encouraged by the<br/> opportunity which we then
                            had, we sent to the<br/> care of the Agent for Indian Affairs some
                            ploughs,<br/> harness for horses, axes, hoes, and other imple-<br/>ments
                            of husbandry, which were made for the<br/> use of our Red Brethren, and
                            desired that they<br/> might be distributed amongst them as tokens
                            of<br/> our friendship.</p>
<p>Brothers: We received last fall, through<br/> the hands of the Agent for
                            Indian Affairs, a<br/> talk from the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                            Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>,<br/> and others, informing us that they had
                            received<br/> the implements of husbandry, and requested<br/> that their
                            Brothers of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> would
                            send<br/> some of their people into the country of their<br/> Red
                            Brethren for the purpose of seing their<br/> situation, and showing them
                            how to make use of<br/> the tools, saying they did not know how to<br/>
                            begin. </p>
<p>Brothers: It is for these purposes that we<br/> have now come; and we
                            again repeat, that we<br/> rejoice we have the opportunity of seeing
                            you,<br/> and of taking you by the hand.</p>
<p>Brothers: In coming into the country of our<br/> Red Brethren, we have
                            come with our eyes open.<br/> And although we are affected with sorrow,
                            in<br/> believing that many of the Red Brethren suffer<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_072" n="72"></pb>
                            much for the want of food and for the want of<br/> clothing, yet our
                            hearts have been made glad, in<br/> seeing that it has pleased the Great
                            Spirit to<br/> give you a rich and valuable country. Because<br/> we
                            know that it is out of the earth that food<br/> and clothing come. We
                            are sure, brothers, that<br/> with but little labor and attention, you
                            may raise<br/> much more corn and other grain than will be<br/>
                            necessary for yourselves, your women and chil-<br/>dren, and may also,
                            with great ease, raise many<br/> more horses, cows, sheep, hogs and
                            other valuable<br/> animals, than will be necessary for your own
                            use.<br/> We are also confident, that if you will pursue<br/> our method
                            in the cultivation of your land, you<br/> will live in much greater ease
                            and plenty,<br/> and<br/> with much less fatigue and toil, than
                            attend<br/> hunting, for a subsistence.</p>
<p>Brothers: We are fully convinced, that if<br/> you will adopt our mode of
                            cultivating the earth,<br/> and of raising useful animals, you will find
                            it to<br/> be a mode of living, not only far more plentiful<br/> and
                            much less fatiguing, but also much more<br/> certain, and which will
                            expose your bodies less<br/> to the inclemencies of the weather than is
                            now<br/> attendant upon hunting. It will lead you,<br/> brothers, to
                            have fixed homes. You will build<br/> comfortable dwelling-houses for
                            yourselves, your<br/> women and children, where you may be
                            shelter-<br/>ed from the rain, from the frost, and from the<br/> snow,
                            and where you may enjoy in plenty the<br/> rewards of your labors.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_073" n="73"></pb>
<p>Brothers: In laying these things before<br/> you, we have no other motive
                            than a desire of<br/> heart for the improvement, the benefit and
                            the<br/> welfare of our Red Brethren- and therefore it<br/> is that we
                            speak with freedom, and we hope,<br/> that what we have to say, will go
                            in at one ear,<br/> and not come out the other, but that it will be<br/>
                            remembered by our Red Brethren. For we<br/> know, brothers, that we
                            shall not be ashamed of<br/> what we say, when, in time to come, you
                            com-<br/>pare the things we are saying to you with your<br/> experience
                            in practising them.</p>
<p>Brothers: We will here mention, that the<br/> time was, when the
                            forefathers of your brothers,<br/> the white people, lived beyond the
                            great water,<br/> in the same manner that our Red Brethren now<br/>
                            live. The winters can yet be counted when<br/> they went almost naked,
                            when they procured their<br/> living by fishing, and by the bow and
                            arrow in<br/> hunting- and when they lived in houses no bet-<br/>ter
                            than yours. They were encouraged by some<br/> who came from the
                            sun-rising, and lived amongst<br/> them, to change their mode of living.
                            They<br/> did change- they cultivated the earth, and we<br/> are sure
                            the change was a happy one.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends: We are not ashamed<br/> to acknowledge that the
                            time was when our fore-<br/>fathers rejoiced at finding a wild plumb
                            tree, or<br/> at killing a little game, and that they wandered<br/> up
                            and down, living on the uncertain supplies<br/> of fishing and hunting.
                            But, brothers, for your <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_074" n="74"></pb> encouragement, we now mention
                            that, by turn-<br/>ing their attention to the cultivation of the<br/>
                            earth, instead of the plumb tree, they soon had<br/> orchards of many
                            kinds of good fruits- instead<br/> of wild game, they soon had large
                            numbers of<br/> cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, and other valuable<br/>
                            animals,- and in many places, instead of their<br/> forests, they had
                            large fields of corn and other<br/> grain, as also many other valuable
                            productions<br/> of the earth.</p>
<p>Brothers: We hope your eyes will be open<br/> to see clearly, the things
                            which are best for you,<br/> and that you will desire to pursue them.
                            We<br/> believe, brothers, that it is in the heart of your<br/> father,
                            the President of the United States, to<br/> assist his red children in
                            the cultivation of the<br/> earth, and to render them services which
                            will be<br/> greatly for their benefit and welfare. We hope<br/> that
                            your exertions to change your present mode<br/> of living will be so
                            plain to him, that he will<br/> see them. This will encourage him to
                            continue<br/> to aid you, in your endeavors.</p>
<p>Brothers, we have spoken plainly; we de-<br/>sire to speak plainly. We
                            will now tell you<br/> that we have not come merely to talk to you.<br/>
                            We have come prepared to render you a little<br/> assistance. Our
                            beloved brother, <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>,<br/>
                            who is now present, has come along with us.<br/> His desire is to
                            cultivate for you a field of corn;<br/> also, to show you how to raise
                            some of the other<br/> productions of the earth. He knows how to
                            use<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_075" n="75"></pb> the plough, the hoe, the axe, and other
                            imple-<br/>ments of husbandry.</p>
<p>Brothers, we here ask you, are you still de-<br/>sirous to be instructed
                            by us, in the cultivation<br/> of your lands? If you say you are, our
                            brother,<br/> whom we have just mentioned, will continue<br/> with you
                            during the summer. We shall leave<br/> it to you to show him the spot
                            where to begin<br/> to work.</p>
<p>Brothers, he has left a farm, he has left a<br/> wife, and five small
                            children, who are very dear<br/> to him; he has come from a sincere
                            desire to be<br/> useful to our red brothers. His motives are<br/> pure,
                            he will ask no reward from you, for his<br/> services, his greatest
                            reward will be in the satis-<br/>faction he will feel in finding you
                            inclined to<br/> take hold of the same tools which he takes hold<br/>
                            of, to receive from him instruction in the culti-<br/>vation of your
                            lands, and to pursue the example<br/> he will set you.</p>
<p>Brothers, we hope you will make the situa-<br/>tion of our brother as
                            comfortable as circum-<br/>stances will admit. We hope, also, that
                            many<br/> of your young men will be willing to be taught<br/> by him, to
                            use the plough, the hoe, and other<br/> implements of husbandry. For we
                            are sure,<br/> brothers, that as you take hold of such tools as<br/> are
                            in the hands of the white people, you will<br/> find them to be to you
                            like having additional<br/> hands. You will also find that by using
                            them,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_076" n="76"></pb> they will enable you to do many things
                            which,<br/> without them, cannot be performed.</p>
<p>Brothers, there is one thing more which we<br/> wish to add. The white
                            people, in order to get<br/> their land cultivated, find it necessary
                            that their<br/> young men should be employed in it, and not<br/> their
                            women. Women are less than men. They<br/> are not as strong as men. They
                            are not as able<br/> to endure fatigue as men. It is the business
                            of<br/> our women to be employed in our houses, to<br/> keep them clean,
                            to sew, to knit, spin, and<br/> weave, to dress food for themselves and
                            families,<br/> to make clothes for the men and the rest of their<br/>
                            families, to keep the clothes of their families<br/> clean, and to take
                            care of their children. </p>
<p>Brothers, we desire not to mention too many<br/> things to you, but we
                            must add a little further.<br/> We are fully convinced that if you will
                            turn your<br/> attention to the cultivation of the earth, to
                            rais-<br/>ing the different kinds of grain, to erecting mills<br/> for
                            grinding grain, to building comfortable dwell-<br/>ing houses for your
                            families, to raising useful<br/> animals- amongst others, sheep, for the
                            advan-<br/>tage of the wool, in making clothing- to raising<br/> flax
                            and hemp for your linen; and your young<br/> women learn to spin and
                            weave, that your lives<br/> would be easier and happier than at
                            present,<br/> and that your numbers will increase, and not<br/> continue
                            to diminish. As we observed,<br/> brothers, your land is good. It is far
                            better<br/> than the land the white people near the great<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_077" n="77"></pb> water cultivate. We are persuaded that your<br/> land will produce
                            double the quantity of any<br/> kind of grain, or of flax, or of hemp,
                            with the<br/> same labor necessary near the great water. </p>
<p>Brothers and Friends: We shall now end<br/> what we have to say, with
                            informing you that<br/>all the corn, and other productions of the
                            earth,<br/> which <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> may
                            raise, we wish our<br/> red brethren to accept of, as a token of
                            our<br/> friendship. And it is our desire that the chiefs<br/> of
                                <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowatamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> nations, who<br/> are now present, added to our
                            brothers, the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>,
                            <a href="/people/topin1">Tuthenipee<persname key="topin1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, make<br/> such a distribution
                            thereof as they may think<br/> proper. * <note rend="asterisk">The
                                address was published in pamphlet form in<br/>

<p>The Indians observed great gravity and de-<br/>corum, during the time of our
                    addressing them,<br/> and seemed to reiterate the sentiments delivered<br/> by
                    repeated shouts.</p>
<p>At the close of our communication, a short<br/> pause took place, during which we
                    informed<br/> them that we had no more to add at present,<br/> but wished them
                    to speak freely. After which<br/> a conversation, occupying several minutes
                    took<br/> place between the chiefs, and some of their<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_078" n="78"></pb> principal
                    men, which being in the Indian lan-<br/>guage was to us unintelligible. They
                    then rose<br/> upon their feet, and shook hands with us with<br/> great
                    solemnity, and returned to their<br/> seats.</p>
<p>In a few moments the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> arose

<p>Brothers, it appears to me to be necessary<br/> that I should give you an
                            immediate answer, as<br/> you are about to return to your families
                            from<br/> whence you came.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends, we are all pleased<br/> to see you here, and to
                            take our brothers, the<br/> Quakers, through you by the hand. We
                            re-<br/>joice that the Great Spirit has appointed that<br/> we should
                            this day meet. For we believe, that<br/> this meeting will be of the
                            utmost consequence<br/> to your red brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers, what you have said, we have care-<br/>fully gathered up, we
                            have placed it in our hearts,<br/> in order that it may be communicated
                            to our<br/> posterity. We are convinced that what you<br/> have said is
                            for the good of your red brethren.<br/> We are also convinced that our
                            chiefs and war-<br/>riors, our women and children will be all of our
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_079" n="79"></pb> opinion, and will be glad when they have
                            heard<br/> what you have said.</p>
<p>Brothers, we take you now by the hand, and<br/> through you we take the
                            people who sent you<br/> here by the hand, and assure you we are
                            pleased<br/> that the Great Spirit has let us see each other,<br/> and
                            converse together upon the subjects which<br/> you have communicated to
                            us.</p>
<p>Brothers, you see there is not a large num-<br/>ber of us here. What you
                            have said to us will<br/> not remain with those who are here alone.
                            It<br/> will be communicated to all your red brethren<br/> in this
                            country. And I again repeat, that I am<br/> convinced they will be glad
                            to hear what you<br/> have said to us, to our women and children.</p>
<p>Brothers, when we saw you with the rest of<br/> our brothers in
                                <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, upwards of two
                            years<br/> ago, I expect you recollect perfectly the conver-<br/>sation
                            between us at that time and place. I,<br/> there with my brother chiefs,
                            told you that we<br/> were glad to find you so much disposed to
                            assist<br/> us, our women and children. We told you that<br/> your good
                            wished should be made known to all<br/> your red brethren in this
                            country, which has<br/> been done.</p>
<p>Brothers, ever since that time, I, as well as<br/> some others of my
                            brother chiefs, have been en-<br/>deavoring to turn the minds of our
                            people to-<br/>wards the cultivation of the earth, but I am<br/> sorry
                            to say we have not yet been able to effect<br/> any thing.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_080" n="80"></pb>
<p>Brothers, there are so few of our chiefs now<br/> present, it would not
                            be proper for us to under-<br/>take to give a pointed answer to your
                            talk. We<br/> expect that in a few moons there will be many<br/> of our
                            people together. At that time it will be<br/> proper that we should
                            return an answer to all<br/> the subjects you now mention to us.</p>
<p>Brothers, the things you have said to us re-<br/>quire the greatest
                            attention. It appears to me<br/> to be really necessary to deliberate
                            upon them.<br/> In order to do so, we must beg to leave the paper<br/>
                            upon which they are written, that we may com-<br/>municate them to our
                            chiefs when they assemble.</p>
<p>Brothers, all the words which you have said<br/> to-day were certainly
                            calculated for our good.<br/> You have enumerated to us the different
                            kinds<br/> of grain and animals we ought to raise for our<br/> comfort.
                            You have told us that if we all adopt<br/> the plan you have proposed,
                            we should want for<br/> nothing. This, brothers, myself and many of
                            our<br/> people believe is true, and we hope we shall<br/> finally be
                            able to convince our young men that<br/> this is the plan we ought to
                            adopt to get our<br/> living.</p>
<p>Brothers, you have come a long distance to<br/> render service to us. We
                            hope that you will<br/> meet with the success you wish, you have
                            been<br/> very particular in pointing out to us what will<br/> be for
                            our good. You have also been very par-<br/>ticular in pointing out to us
                            the duties of our<br/> women, and you have told us that in adopting<br/>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_081" n="81"></pb> your mode of living, our numbers would increase<br/> and
                            not diminish. In all this I perfectly agree<br/> with you. And I hope
                            the other chiefs will<br/> also agree with you.</p>
<p>Brothers, we are pleased to hear you say<br/> you are going to leave one
                            of your brothers with<br/> us, to show us in what manner you cultivate
                            the<br/> earth. We shall endeavor, brothers, to make<br/> his situation
                            amongst us as agreeable to him as<br/> will be possible for us.</p>
<p>Brothers, we are convinced that the plan<br/> you propose will be highly
                            advantageous to your<br/> red brethren. We are also convinced that
                            you<br/> have observed very justly that we shall not then<br/> be liable
                            to sickness. We are certain that we<br/> shall then be able to make a
                            more comfortable<br/> living with less labor than at present. And I<br/>
                            hope that this will be the opinion of us all.</p>
<p>Brothers, assure your people who sent you<br/> here, tell your old chiefs
                            that we are obliged to<br/> them for their friendly offers to assist us
                            in<br/> changing our present mode of living; tell them<br/> that it is a
                            work which cannot be done immediate-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_082" n="82"></pb>ly,- that we are
                            that way disposed, and we hope<br/> it will take place gradually.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>Here the speaker sat down for a short time,<br/> and then rose again, saying,</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-10"></date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers, my heart is so overjoyed and<br/> warmed with what you have
                            said, that I find I<br/> had forgot to mention one of the most
                            important<br/> things.</p>
<p>Brothers, at the time we first met at this<br/> place, the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> and myself formed some<br/> idea
                            of your business. We expected you had<br/> come to do for us the things
                            you had proposed<br/> to us when in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. We consulted each<br/> other upon the answer
                            necessary to return to<br/> you in every respect, and I now find that
                            our<br/> idea was right.</p>
<p>Brothers, the sentiments which I have de-<br/>livered to you were his
                            sentiments. You have<br/> now told us, that your brother has a mind
                            to<br/> live amongst us to show us how to cultivate the<br/> earth, and
                            have desired us to show him the spot<br/> where to begin. We agreed
                            then, that he should<br/> be at neither of our villages, lest our
                            younger<br/> brothers should be jealous of our taking him to<br/>
                            ourselves. We have determined to place him<br/> on the <geogname key="wabas">Waash</geogname>, where some of our families will<br/>
                            follow him,-where our young men I hope will<br/> flock to him, and where
                            he will be able to in-<br/>struct them as he wished. This is all I have
                            to<br/> say. I could all day repeat the sentiments I<br/> have already
                            expressed; also how much I have<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_083" n="83"></pb> been gratified in
                            seeing and hearing my brothers;<br/> but that is not necessary. I am
                            sorry, brothers,<br/> that the chiefs of our country are not all
                            present,<br/> that they might all hear what you have said, and<br/> have
                            an opportunity of talking to you.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>At the close of this speech we were informed<br/> that nothing would be added by
                    the Indians to<br/> the communication made by the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>.<br/> We then told them that the words spoken by<br/> the
                        <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> should be carefully
                    carried<br/> home to our brothers and friends who had sent<br/> us. We also
                    informed them that notwithstanding<br/> we were now desirous to return to our
                    homes as<br/> soon as possible, yet we wished to see the place<br/> which they
                    designed to be the station of our<br/> brother, <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                        Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, and hoped some of them<br/> would show it to us. We
                    further added, that<br/> this did not arise from any jealousy in our<br/> minds
                    that the place fixed upon was not suitable.<br/> On the contrary, we had no
                    doubt that they had<br/> judged wisely; but that the love and respect<br/> which
                    we bore to our brother, led us to desire to<br/> bear him company to the place,
                    and also to ren-<br/>der him every assistance in our power before we<br/> left
                    him.</p>
<p>They then informed us that they would con-<br/>sult and fix upon some one to go
                    with us. The<br/> business of the council being then at an end, we<br/> in turn
                    rose from our seats, and shook hands<br/> with them, which concluded the
                    formalities of<br/> the opportunity. After entering into a little<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_084" n="84"></pb> conversation, we told them we should now bid<br/> them farewell, as we
                    expected we should not see<br/> them again. They then took us separately by<br/>
                    the hand, and with marks of great affection and<br/> friendship bade us
                    farewell, and we returned to<br/> our quarters.</p>

<dateline><date when="1804-04-12">4th month 12th</date>.<placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Being a fine pleasant morn-<br/>ing we set out for the place on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> as-<br/>signed by the Indians to <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>. We<br/> were accompanied by <a href="/people/wwell1">Wiliam Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/clear1">Mas-sanonga, (or Clear Sky,)<persname key="clear1"></persname></a> a handsome young man<br/> of
                    the <a href="/organizations/wea">Wea tribe<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a>, deputed by the Indians to<br/> pilot
                    us, who (by the bye) says he shall be the<br/> first young man to take hold of
                        <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>'<br/> plough.</p>
<p>After riding eight miles, we came to the place<br/> called the <a href="/places/port">Portage<placename key="port"></placename></a>, on the <geogname key="little">Little
                        river</geogname>, a navigable<br/> water of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>. Then down the margin<br/> of the river, leaving it to
                    our left. At the end<br/> of four miles, crossed <geogname key="sandy">Sandy
                        Creek</geogname>, another navi-<br/>gable water of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>; then proceeded<br/> through the woods, and at the end of
                    thirteen<br/> miles further again came to <geogname key="little">Little
                        river</geogname>, at a<br/> place called the <geogfeat key="sadd">Saddle</geogfeat>. This name is derived<br/> from a large rock in the bed
                    of the river in the<br/> shape of a saddle. From the <geogfeat key="sadd">Saddle</geogfeat> we pro-<br/>ceeded six miles along the margin of the
                    river<br/> to its junction with the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>.</p>
<p>The bed of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> here is of limestone.<br/>
                    After riding five miles further, we came to a<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_085" n="85"></pb> vein of land
                    about one mile in width, the sur-<br/>face of which is covered with small flint
                    stones,<br/> and which we are told extends for several miles.<br/>On examining
                    these flints, we found them of<br/> excellent quality.</p>
<p>Here the Indians supply themselves with flints<br/> for their guns and for other
                    purposes, and here<br/> formerly they procured their darts. It has
                    cer-<br/>tainly been a place abundantly resorted to from<br/> time immemorial.
                    This is evident from the sur-<br/>face of the ground being dug in holes of two
                    and<br/> three feet in depth, over nearly the whole tract.<br/> This flinty vein
                    is called by the Indians <geogname key="fathf">Father<br/> Flint</geogname>.
                    They have a tradition concerning its<br/> origin which is very incredible. From
                    this we<br/> proceeded, and after riding two miles, reached<br/> the place
                    proposed by the Indians.</p>
<p>This place is thirty-two miles rather south of<br/> west from <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, and is situated on the<br/>
<geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, at a place called the Boat-yard,
                    which<br/> name it obtained from the circumstance of<br/>
<a href="/people/gwilk2">General Wilkinson<persname key="gwilk2"></persname></a> having built some flat,<br/>
                    bottomed boats here, for the purpose of tran-<br/>sporting some of the baggage
                    of the American<br/> troops down the river. It was formerly the seat<br/> of an
                    Indian town of the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, and we are<br/>
                    pleased to find there are about twenty-five acres<br/> of land clear. The
                        <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> here makes a beau-<br/>tiful
                    appearance, and is about sixty yards wide.<br/> A little above is an island in
                    the river, on one<br/> side of which the water runs with a strong cur-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_086" n="86"></pb>rent, and affords a good mill seat. We viewed<br/> the land in this
                    neighborhood for a considerable<br/> distance, and found it high and of
                    superior<br/> quality, being covered with sugar trees of enor-<br/>mous size,
                    black walnut, white walnut, hack-<br/>berry, blue ash, oak buckeye trees,
                    &amp;c., all very<br/> large. The land appears to be equal in quality<br/> to
                    any we have seen, not excepting the bottoms<br/> of the <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname> and <geogname key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogname>. About
                    half a<br/> mile below, a handsome creek falls into the river<br/> from the
                    north, which we traced for a consider-<br/>able distance, and are convinced it
                    affords a good<br/> mill seat. This creek bearing no name, we called<br/> it
                        <geogname key="dennc">Dennis' Creek</geogname> in honor of <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>. </p>
<p>As night approached, <a href="/people/clear1">Massanonga<persname key="clear1"></persname></a>, taking
                    his<br/> knife, left us, and in about fifteen minutes re-<br/>turned with a
                    remarkably fine turkey. This he<br/> prepared and roasted for us in a very nice
                    and<br/> expeditious manner, on which we fared sumptu-<br/>ously. At 9 o'clock
                    we wrapped ourselves in<br/> our blankets, and laid down to sleep before
                    the<br/> fire, having no shelter. The night was frosty;<br/> we, however, slept
                    tolerably and took no cold.</p>
<p>In the night the otters were very noisy along<br/> the river, the deer also
                    approached our fire and<br/> made a whistling noise; the wolves howled, and<br/>
                    at the dawn of day turkies gobbled in all direct-<br/>tions.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-13">13th.</date><placename key="fwayn"></placename></dateline>
<p>Early this morning we arose, and<br/> breakfasted on the remains of the turkey
                    cooked<br/> last evening, after which we fixed upon the place<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_087" n="87"></pb>
                    for <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>' farm; we also staked out
                    the<br/> situation for his wigwam, which is about one<br/> hundred feet from the
                    banks of the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, and<br/> opposite to a
                    fine spring of excellent water issuing<br/> out of the bank of the river.</p>
<p>We are told by several persons well acquainted<br/> with the country, that from
                    hence to <a href="/places/stvin">St. Vin-cennes<placename key="stvin"></placename></a>, on the
                        <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, a distance of two hun-<br/>dred
                    miles by land, and three hundred and fifty<br/> by water, the land on both sides
                    of the river<br/> embracing a very extensive width, is not inferior<br/> to the
                    description given of this location in yes-<br/>terday's notes.</p>
<p>At <a href="/places/missi1">Mississinaway<placename key="missi1"></placename></a>, a large Indian town of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/miami">Miami's<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, situated about thirty miles below
                    us,<br/> on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, stone coal is found,
                    which with<br/> limestone continues for two hundred miles down<br/> the
                    river.</p>
<p>There are no Indians between this and <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                        Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, neither any between this and <a href="/places/missi1">Mississin-away<placename key="missi1"></placename></a>. <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                        Dennis'<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> nearest neighbors will be<br/> at the <a href="/places/lturtown">Little Turtle's town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a>, eighteen miles
                    dis-<br/>tant. Whilst here we have seen four peroques<br/> loaded with peltry,
                    manned by Canadians and In-<br/>dians, on their way up the river to be
                    tran-<br/>sported to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>I may here observe that the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> affords<br/>
                    an abundance of large turtles, called soft shelled<br/> turtles, the outer coat
                    being a hard skin, rather<br/> than a shell. They are esteemed excellent
                    food.<br/> It affords a great variety of fine fish, and<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_088" n="88"></pb> we saw
                    ducks in abundance; we are told it is re-<br/>sorted to by geese and swans.</p>
<p>About 8 o'clock in the morning we set out<br/> for <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                        Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, where we arrived about 3 o'clock<br/> in the afternoon,
                    and after dining with <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>
                    returned to our lodgings.</p>

<p>I may here observe that some days ago<br/> we came to a conclusion to return home
                    by the<br/> way of the lakes; to this we have been induced<br/> from a hope that
                    we shall be subjected to fewer<br/> difficulties and much less fatigue than to
                    retrace<br/> the way by which we came; and I may also<br/> add, that we have
                    been encouraged to this by<br/> the advice of our kind friends heretofore
                    named,<br/> who have with much apparent cheefulness<br/> offered to prepare a
                    way for us; and this morn-<br/>ing being informed by our worthy friend,
                        <a href="/people/awhip1">Cap-tain Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>, that the boat
                    intended for us<br/> would be in readiness against to-morrow, we<br/> spent the
                    day in making preparations, and in<br/> writing to our families.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-15">15th.</date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>This morning we bade both a joyful<br/> and sorrowful farewell to <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, and<br/> the two young men who
                    accompanied us out.<br/> We also took leave of those generally with whom<br/> we
                    had formed an acquaintance, first breakfast-<br/>ing with <a href="/people/awhip1">Captain Whipple<persname key="awhip1"></persname></a>, whose hearty kind-<br/>ness to us has been so
                    often repeated, that his<br/> name will deservedly claim a place in our
                    re-<br/>membrance. He has fitted out a perogue for us<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_089" n="89"></pb> and
                    manned it with a corporal and private<br/> soldier from the fort; and, joined by
                        <a href="/people/jjohn2">John John-son<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, has stocked it with an<br/> apparent
                    superabundant supply both for eating<br/> and drinking.</p>
<p>About 8 o'clock we embarked for <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>,
                    pro-<br/>ceeded about thirty miles down the <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname> of the<br/> lakes, and in the evening encamped under a
                    tent<br/> near the margin of the river. With respect to<br/> the appearance of
                    the country, the same old<br/> phrase must be continued; <q>land of
                        excellent<br/> quality.</q> We several times went ashore to view<br/> the
                    river bottoms, they were extensive and ap-<br/>peared to be first rate land. The
                    timber, buck<br/> eye, ash, elm, sugar tree, oak, hickory, black<br/> and white
                    walnut, &amp;c. We saw ducks in abun-<br/>dance, and <persname>Corporal
                        King</persname> says they breed here<br/> in great numbers. This river
                    affords a variety<br/> of fine fish, and mostly of descriptions very
                    dif-<br/>ferent from those found in our salt waters. Of<br/> these the following
                    are some of the names;<br/> black, yellow, and white bass, covers,
                    pickerel,<br/> suckers, herrings, muscanago, gar, pike, catfish,<br/>
                    sheeps-head, carp, and sturgeon. These are all<br/> caught with the hook except
                    the two last.</p>
<p>The sturgeon are now on their way from the<br/> lake to the head waters of the
                        <geogname key="stjos">St. Joseph's</geogname> and<br/>
<geogname key="stmar">St. Mary's rivers</geogname>. In company with the
                        <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, our friends, <a href="/people/jjohn2">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wwell1">William
                        Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, and some others, whilst at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                        Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,<br/> the conversation turned upon fish, and the
                    then<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_090" n="90"></pb> running up of the sturgeon; the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/> very humorously proposed to <a href="/people/jjohn2">Johnson<persname key="jjohn2"></persname></a> a project,<br/> which was to join in
                    building a stone dam at the<br/> junction of the two rivers, to prevent the
                    sturgeon<br/> from getting back again to the lake, and then said<br/> he <said who="lturt1">you and I will live on them this summer.</said></p>
<p>We observed to-day (<date when="1804-04-15">15th,</date>) several hunting<br/>
                    and sugar camps, and went on shore to visit two<br/> of the latter. The camps
                    were well supplied<br/> with jerk venison, dried raccoon, sturgeon,
                    &amp;c.;<br/> one man only was at the camp, and he was em-<br/>ployed with his
                    knife in making a paddle for his<br/> canoe. A squaw was knitting a bag, and
                    an-<br/>other was preparing the bark of the buckeye for<br/> thread, strings,
                    &amp;c., by beating it with a piece<br/> of wood. We saw amongst them several
                    fat and<br/> healthy looking children, who were playful and<br/> did not appear
                    to be afraid of us. The children<br/> presented us with a quarter of fresh
                    venison, for<br/> which we returned them some salt meat and bis-<br/>cuit, with
                    which they were pleased. Here we<br/> saw a child about six months old fixed to
                    a board<br/> in the genuine Indian fashion. The board was<br/> straight, about
                    fifteen inches in width, and two<br/> and a half feet in length, having at its
                    head a<br/> circular handle, and at the foot a small ledge<br/> To this the
                    child was lashed by cloth bandages,<br/> and so tight that it could not move
                    hand or foot.<br/> The board was placed against a tree, almost
                    per-<br/>pendicularly, and the infant asleep- of course in<br/> a standing
                    position. The child was painted very<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_091" n="91"></pb> red, and had silver
                    bandages about its wrists,<br/> and ornaments of the same metal in its
                    ears.<br/> The Indians are very fond of their children, and<br/> put about them
                    very costly silver ornaments.</p>
<p>I have seen Indian children dressed in a calico<br/> frock which was stuck with
                    silver broaches from<br/> neck to heel, besides ornaments on the wrists,<br/> in
                    the ear, and about the neck and head.</p>

<p>Proceeded very pleasantly<br/> down the river about fifty miles, and at
                    night<br/> encamped under our tent. In the evening a<br/> severe thunder gust
                    came on, with heavy rain,<br/> which continued for several hours after
                    night,<br/> but having a good tent we did not get much<br/> wetted. In the
                    course of the day we saw wild<br/> fowl in abundance, also passed by several
                    Indian<br/> hunting and sugar camps. Our Corporal is very<br/> fond of saluting
                    the camps with an imitation of<br/> an Indian whoop, which they are sure to
                    answer<br/> by a similar not. This whoop very nearly re-<br/>sembles the shrill
                    yelp of a dog. The land ap-<br/>pears to be of an excellent quality, and deer
                    and<br/> turkies are very numerous. Here also<br/>
<q>The prowling wolf howls hideous all night long,<br/> And owls vociferate the
                        dread response.</q></p>

<p>Proceeded about thirty-five miles, and at<br/> night encamped under our tent. We
                    have been<br/> entertained to-day with a diversified scene. The<br/> river
                    covered with wild fowl, fish jumping up<br/> around us, and turkies flying.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_092" n="92"></pb>
<p>We stopped a short time to view the remains<br/> of <a href="/places/fdefi">Fort
                        Defiance<placename key="fdefi"></placename></a>. This fort was built by <a href="/people/gwayn1">Gene-ral Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>, in the course of his march to attack<br/>
                    the Indians. The situation is very beautiful and<br/> commanding, at the
                    junction of the river <geogname key="augl">Great<br/> Au Glaize</geogname> with
                    the <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>. The two rivers<br/> make a large
                    body of water, the width being<br/> about two hundred yards. A Canadian
                    trader<br/> only resides here. We also went on shore several<br/> times to visit
                    Indian towns and camps. Great<br/> numbers of Indians are settled upon the
                    banks<br/> of the Miami; they are chiefly of the <a href="/organizations/odawa">Ottoway<orgname key="odawa"></orgname></a><br/> and <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>
                    tribes. They appeared pleased<br/> at receiving visitors. Their children were
                    very<br/> antic, and seemed to leap for joy on seeing us<br/> land; doubtless
                    from a hope of receiving some<br/> presents. The hunters are returning to
                    their<br/> towns, and many of their wigwams are stocked<br/> with peltry, dried
                    raccoon, and jerk venison.<br/> They are on their way to the foot of the
                    rapids.<br/> The women are mostly employed in knitting<br/> bags and belts and
                    in making moccasins. A<br/> considerable number of Indians are on the river<br/>
                    in bark canoes loaded with peltry. They are on<br/> the way to the foot of the
                    rapids and other places<br/> for the purpose of exchanging their peltry
                    with<br/> the traders for goods. Most of the wigwams we<br/> have seen to-day
                    are covered with rushes sewed<br/> together, which are procured from the shores of<br/>
<geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>, and so put together, that the
                    covering<br/> will turn any fall of rain. An Indian house is<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_093" n="93"></pb>
                    constructed by putting two forks into the ground,<br/> and a horizontal piece
                    from one fork to the<br/> other. Upon this piece rest long pieces of bark,<br/>
                    with the other end upon the earth at a conveni-<br/>ent distance, thus
                    sheltering them from the<br/> weather. Sometimes they make circular
                    wig-<br/>wams, by putting small saplings into the ground<br/> in circular order,
                    then bringing the other ends<br/> to a point, they tie them together. These
                    they<br/> either cover with bark or with the rush mats<br/> before
                    described.</p>
<p>To-day we passed a place called <a href="/places/girtyt">Girty's
                    town<placename key="girtyt"></placename></a>,<br/> noted for the former residence of <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-18">18th.</date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Proceeded about thirty-three miles. In<br/> the earlier part of the day we passed
                    several<br/> creeks and small streams, and at length reached<br/> what is called
                    the head of the <geogname key="miamr1">rapids</geogname>. The river is<br/> here
                    about four hundred yards wide. The noise<br/> of the falls informed us of our
                    approach, long be-<br/>lieve that our peroque was manned by careful<br/> hands,
                    we resolutely entered the <geogname key="miamr1">rapids</geogname> and
                    de-<br/>scended with great velocity down the fall for the<br/> distance of
                    eighteen miles to the foot of the<br/>
<geogname key="miamr1">rapids</geogname>. The whole of this distance is a
                    continued<br/> fall, the land falling with the same regularity,<br/> and
                    generally elevated but a few feet above the<br/> surface of the water. It is
                    needless to say that<br/> we went swiftly down, when I add, that it is a<br/>
                    trip occupying but one hour and a half.</p>
<p>The bed of the river is a solid limestone rock,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_094" n="94"></pb>At the foot of
                    the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname> we lodged all night at<br/> the
                    house of a Canadian trader, who treated us<br/> with great respect, and, though
                    a tavern-keeper,<br/> would receive no pay from us for our supper,<br/>
                    lodgings, or breakfast. A considerable encamp-<br/>ment of Indians, who had come
                    to trade with<br/> him was near his house. They were very merry<br/> for a great
                    part of the night, keeping up a con-<br/>tinued sound of their favorite
                    instruments of<br/> music, amongst them the drum and fife. The<br/> former is
                    made of part of the body of a hollow<br/> tree, with the ends covered with deer
                    skin, upon<br/> which they beat with sticks, the latter they<br/> make of reed
                    into which they bore holes some-<br/>what in imitation of a fife. The foot of the<br/>
<geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname> is rendered well known in American
                    his-<br/>tory, as having been a place of frequent ren-<br/>dezvous by the
                    Indians, previous to their defeat<br/> by <a href="/people/gwayn1">General
                        Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>. Here also the Indians burnt<br/> many of the white men who
                    were taken prisoners<br/> by them. To this place <a href="/people/gwayn1">Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> marched, and<br/> here he met and defeated the Indian
                    army.</p>
<p>About eight miles above the foot of the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname><br/> and near the centre of the river, in a very rapid<br/>
                    situation, is a noted rock called by the Cana-<br/>dians, <geogname key="roche">Rochede Bout</geogname>, (or standing rock.) This<br/> rock is about thirty
                    feet in height above the<br/> surface of the water, and the same in
                    diameter.<br/> The top has the regular appearance of the roof<br/> of a house,
                    and the body of the rock is circular.<br/> Its appearance is additionally
                    handsome from<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_095" n="95"></pb> the circumstance of the roof, as it is called,
                    being<br/> covered with cedar. </p>
<p>Fish are now passing up the <geogname key="miamir1">Rapids</geogname> in
                    great<br/> numbers from the lakes, in so much that the water<br/> smells
                    strongly of them. They are taken very<br/> abundantly by the Canadians and
                    Indians. The<br/> fisherman without seeing them strikes his barbed<br/> spear to
                    the rocks, which often passes through<br/> several at a time, and frequently of
                    different<br/> kinds. The muscanonje are taken here in great<br/> numbers; they
                    are a fish from three to five feet in<br/> length.</p>

<p>This morning we proceeded with diffi-<br/>culty ten miles; owing to high winds,
                    and a rain<br/>coming on, prudence seemed to dictate that we<br/> should put
                    into a harbor, which we did at the<br/> mouth of <geogname key="swanc">Swan
                        creek</geogname>, where is a small fort and<br/> garrison lately established
                    by the United States.<br/> Introductory letters were given us at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, to <a href="/people/lrhea1">Lieutenant Rhea<persname key="lrhea1"></persname></a>, the Commandant,<br/> which we delivered. He
                    treated us with respect,<br/> and with him we spent the remainder of the
                    day<br/> and lodged. On our way we stopped to view an<br/> old fort, called
                        <a href="/places/fmiam">Fort Miami<placename key="fmiam"></placename></a>, which was garrisoned<br/> by
                    the British at the time <a href="/people/gwayn1">Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> defeated
                    the<br/> Indians.</p>
<p>Many Indian villages and wigwams are seated<br/> on both shores of the river, and
                    many Canadian<br/> traders are to be found residing amongst them.<br/> They have
                    generally intermarried with the In-<br/>dians, and adopted their manners. Some
                    of the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_096" n="96"></pb> Indian houses which we passed to-day are built<br/> of
                    small round logs, and are roofed with bark.<br/> Near the mouth of <geogname key="swanc">Swan creek</geogname> is an extensive<br/> valley of which we
                    took a particular view. Here<br/> the Indians placed their wives and children
                    at<br/> the time they agreed to make battle with <a href="/people/gwayn1">Gene-ral Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>The river increases in width from the foot of<br/> the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname> toward the lake. It is more than<br/> half a mile wide
                    opposite <geogname key="swanc">Swan creek</geogname>, and at<br/> present has
                    the appearance of tide water; a<br/> strong east wind having brought a heavy
                    swell<br/> from the lake, which has in a short time raised<br/> the river more
                    than three feet in perpendicular<br/> height. We saw to-day geese and swans
                    in<br/> great abundance.</p>

<p>This morning notwithstanding the very<br/> unfavorable appearance of the weather,
                    it being<br/> rainy and wind high, we again proceeded.<br/> At the end of three
                    miles we reached the mouth<br/> of the river, where we entered a beautiful
                    circu-<br/>lar bay, about six miles in diameter, called <geogname key="maume">Miami<br/> bay</geogname>.* <note rend="asterisk">Now called <geogname key="maume">Maumee Bay</geogname>.</note> The wind continuing high, we
                    proceeded<br/> along the margin of the bay, for about ten miles<br/> to a point
                    called <a href="/places/baypo">Bay Point<placename key="baypo"></placename></a>. This is the ex-<br/>treme
                    point of land, between <geogname key="maume">Miami Bay</geogname> and<br/>
<geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>. We attempted to turn the point
                    in<br/> order to enter the lake, but the situation being<br/> bleak and the wind
                    high, occasioned a heavy<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_097" n="97"></pb> swell, and apprehending danger, we
                    thought it<br/> most advisable, however reluctantly, to put to<br/> shore and
                    encamp.</p>
<p>The shore of that part of the bay which we<br/> have passed, as also of the lake
                    now in view, is<br/> elevated but a little above the surface of the<br/> water.
                    The country is level and appears rich.<br/> The bay is resorted to by vast
                    numbers of wild<br/> fowl.</p>

<p>The last night has been very stormy and<br/> rainy. Our tent, though a good, one
                    did not<br/> shelter us altogether from the rain. The high<br/> swells in the
                    course of the night, breaking over<br/> our peroque, filled and sunk her, which
                    has oc-<br/>casioned our men much labor and difficulty. And<br/> during this day
                    the storm continuing, we have<br/> been obliged to remain under our tent. </p>

<p>About midnight the clouds dispersing,<br/> wind becoming calm, and the moon
                    shining very<br/> refulgently, we were encouraged again to embark,<br/>
                    notwithstanding a considerable agitation of the<br/> lake from the storm, and
                    were successful enough<br/> to turn <a href="/places/baypo">Bay
                    Point<placename key="baypo"></placename></a>, after which we proceeded<br/> without difficulty to
                        <a href="/places/prais">Point Raisin<placename key="prais"></placename></a>, near the mouth<br/> of the
                        <geogname key="raisr">river Raisin</geogname>, (or Grape river,) making
                    a<br/> distance of about twelve miles, when the wind<br/> rising we made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to get<br/> round the <a href="/places/prais">Point<placename key="prais"></placename></a>, and were again obliged to seek<br/> a harbor and wait
                    for a calm. Shortly after we<br/> had put into harbor a fish approached the
                    shore<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_098" n="98"></pb> very near to us and seemed to be at play. One<br/> of
                    our men advanced toward it very cautiously,<br/> and with an oar, gave it a blow
                    upon the tail,<br/> which so disabled it that he caught it. We<br/> found it to
                    be a muscanonje, measuring four feet<br/> two inches in length and
                    proportionally thick.<br/> The muscanonje is from head to tail very
                    beau-<br/>tifully spotted, and is I think not inferior to any<br/> fish I ever
                    tasted.</p>
<p>For several days past we have been not a little<br/> mortified at being confined
                    to a harbor, whilst<br/> the Indians are passing us very frequently in<br/>
                    their bark canoes. It is astonishing to see these<br/> canoes riding large
                    swells without danger. It is<br/> certain that they will ride waves whose
                    height<br/> exceeds their length.</p>
<p>Many of the bark canoes of the Indians have<br/> fallen under our observation.
                    They are gene-<br/>rally made of the bark of the birch tree, and<br/> shaped
                    differently. We have seen bark canoes<br/> loaded with two thousand five hundred
                    weight,<br/> which were so light that two men could carry<br/> them on their
                    shoulders with great ease. The<br/> construction of the smaller description of
                    these<br/> boats is so simple, that in an hour they will<br/> have a canoe made
                    which will carry several per-<br/>sons across their rivers. We have also seen
                    many<br/> of their rafts. These are made for crossing<br/> rivers at those
                    seasons of the year when it is not<br/> easy to strip the bark from the trees.
                    In all the<br/> river bottoms the buckeye wood is to be found.<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_099" n="99"></pb>
                    This they prefer for making a raft, on account<br/> of its lightness when dried,
                    it being a wood nearly<br/> as light as cork. The Indians tie together
                    small<br/> logs of the buckeye wood, to form a square of<br/> about five or six
                    feet, this they cross by pieces<br/> of any other description of wood, confining
                    piece<br/> to piece by bark strings, splits of hoop ash, &amp;c.<br/> Upon a
                    raft of this description, three or four<br/> persons will cross their rivers
                    even though the<br/> currenthe against them.</p>
<p>We had not been long in harbor, before our<br/> anxiety to proceed exceeded our
                    patience, and<br/> observing in view at an apparent distance of one<br/> and a
                    half to two miles from us, about fifty<br/> houses resembling a village, we
                    concluded to<br/> abandon our peroque, walk to the settlement,<br/> and then
                    endeavor to procure horses to take us<br/> to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit.<placename key="detro"></placename></a></p>
<p>At 11 o'clock this morning we set out for this<br/> purpose, followed by our men
                    with our baggage<br/> on their backs, and after walking over a wet<br/> prairie,
                    through mud and water, half a leg and<br/> more in depth, for the distance of
                    nearly six<br/> miles, we reached the place. Viewing this set-<br/>tlement from
                    the lake, and over a tract so level<br/> that the elevation between it and us
                    did not ex-<br/>ceed two feet, occasioned us to be so greatly de-<br/>ceived in
                    the distance. On arriving we found<br/> that, instead of a village, it was a
                    settlement of<br/> French farmers situated along the <geogname key="raisr">river
                        Raisin</geogname>,<br/> and presenting a very beautiful scene. The<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_100" n="100"></pb> farms contain from sixty to eighty acres, laid off<br/> in
                    parallelograms. The buildings are good, and<br/> the gardens and orchards
                    handsome. We un-<br/>derstand that about two miles higher up the river<br/>
                    there is another settlement composed of about<br/> forty families, and upon
                        <geogname key="otterc">Otter Creek</geogname>, about four<br/> miles
                    distant, a third settlement containing about<br/> thirty families. These people
                    are Roman Ca-<br/>tholics. We were soon informed that the dis-<br/>tance from
                    here to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> was thirty-six miles<br/> by
                    land, and that the road passed through so flat<br/> and wet a country, for the
                    greater part of the<br/> way, that at this season of the year, it was
                    almost<br/> impossible to travel it on horseback, and were<br/> advised to wait
                    on the wind for a passage by water.<br/> We, therefore, concluded to take
                    lodgings at<br/> the house of <a href="/people/jbedi1">John Bedient<persname key="jbedi1"></persname></a>,
                    who has offered to<br/> entertain us, and dispatched our men to the boat,<br/>
                    with instructions to come up the <geogname key="raisr">river Raisin</geogname>
                    for<br/> us, as soon as wind and weather permitted; being<br/> so wearied and
                    overcome with our "Jack-o-Lan-<br/>tern" excursion, that we could not consent
                    to<br/> retrace our steps to the boat.</p>

<p>A strong west wind, attended with heavy<br/> rain last night and this day, have
                    prevented our<br/> men from getting to us. It is a fact well-known<br/> here,
                    that northwest and west winds are as certain<br/> to produce cloudy weather as
                    easterly winds with<br/> us. This is doubtless owing to the humidity of<br/> the
                    vast western lakes. The same winds are<br/> severely cold in winter, no doubt
                    from the im-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_101" n="101"></pb>mense bodies of ice then accumulated upon
                    those<br/> lakes.</p>

<p>This morning our men arrived about 8<br/> o'clock, with the peroque, the wind
                    having abated<br/> and weather fair. We again embarked, and<br/> on our way down
                    the <geogname key="raisr">river Raisin</geogname> were amused<br/> with the
                    great numbers of wild geese, which<br/> were at play in the ponds near the
                    margin of the<br/> river. They feed here so undisturbedly, that<br/> though we
                    were within gun shot of them, they<br/> took but little notice of us. We again
                    entered<br/> the <geogname key="lakee">lake</geogname>, and encouraged our men
                    to make the<br/> best of its smooth surface. They proceeded with<br/> great
                    industry, and at night we reached a <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyan-dot
                        town<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, called <a href="/places/browt">Brown's town<placename key="browt"></placename></a>,
                    making a distance<br/> of about thirty miles. Here we concluded to<br/> lodge at
                    the house of <a href="/people/wwalk1">William Walker<persname key="wwalk1"></persname></a>, who is<br/>
                    interpreter for those of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> nation
                    who<br/> are settled on this side of the lake. He is<br/> married to an Indian
                    woman who speaks good<br/> English, and is very conversible. She gave us<br/>
                    for supper bacon, bear's meat, and eggs fried,<br/> also a dish of tea.</p>
<p><a href="/places/browt">Brownstown<placename key="browt"></placename></a> is situated at the mouth of the<br/>
<geogname key="detror">Detroit river</geogname>, and on the American side. The<br/>
<geogname key="detror">river Detroit</geogname> is a vast body of running
                    water.<br/> Its mouth is two miles in width, and the water<br/> passes out of it
                    into the lake with a strong cur-<br/>rent. Its channel is wide, generally ten
                    fathoms<br/> in depth, and in many places much deeper. The<br/> name <geogname key="detror">Detroit river</geogname> is a corruption. Detroit, a<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_102" n="102"></pb> French word, signifies the Strait, a name much<br/> more appropos,
                    it being but an outlet from the<br/> waters of the western lakes to <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>.</p>

<p>This morning our curiosity led us to<br/> take a view of <a href="/places/browt">Brownstown<placename key="browt"></placename></a>. The village contains<br/> about one hundred houses,
                    which are generally<br/> built of small round logs, and roofed with elm<br/>
                    bark. These Indians cultivate a considerable<br/> quantity of corn, and their
                    fields are enclosed<br/> with rails of their own splitting. We saw a<br/> sample
                    of the wheat which they had raised the<br/> last season, which looked well. They
                    have gar-<br/>dens and a considerable number of fruit trees.<br/> They have a
                    small number of cattle, and raise a<br/> large number of hogs. The interpreter
                    says they<br/> are greatly disposed to civilization, and have re-<br/>quested of
                    the United States to furnish them<br/> this year with cattle, instead of goods
                    or money<br/> for their annuity.</p>
<p>After taking breakfast, we again embarked<br/> and proceeded up the <geogname key="detror">river Detroit</geogname>, passing by<br/> another Indian town
                    called <a href="/places/walkv">Walk-in-the-Water village<placename key="walkv"></placename></a>, a name
                    derived from the principal chief<br/> of the settlement. The village contains
                    about<br/> twenty houses, and bears the same civilized ap-<br/>pearance as
                        <a href="/places/browt">Brownstown<placename key="browt"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>After passing the <geogname key="lecas">river Le Cas</geogname> and the <geogname key="rangr">river<br/> Range</geogname>, we came opposite to a British
                    town<br/> called <a href="/places/sandw">Sandwich<placename key="sandw"></placename></a>, where, upon an
                    elevated position,<br/> we beheld the horrible spectacle of two men<br/> hanging
                    in gibbets.</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_103" n="103"></pb>
<p>The white settlements, on both the American<br/> and British shores of the
                        <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, are so near<br/> together, that
                    the farms resemble villages.<br/> Nearly opposite <a href="/places/sandw">Sandwich<placename key="sandw"></placename></a> is <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, which
                    we<br/> reached about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and<br/> proceeded to the
                    boarding house of the <a href="/people/wharr2">widowHarrison<persname key="wharr2"></persname></a>, to
                    whom we had been recommended,<br/> having come eighteen miles. In the evening,<br/>
<a href="/people/cjewi1">Charles Jewett<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a> and several others came to
                    see<br/> us; they told us they had heard of the arrival of<br/> some strangers,
                    and expected we were from the<br/> interior of the United States; that for a
                    long<br/> time they had received no account from the seat<br/> of government,
                    and were anxious to hear the<br/> news. Having an open letter from the
                    Secre-<br/>tary of War, directed to <a href="/people/cjewi1">Charles
                        Jewett<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a>, and to<br/> the commanding officer at <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, we embraced<br/> the opportunity to present

<p>This morning <a href="/people/cjewi1">Charles Jewett<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a> again called
                    upon us, and at his request<br/> we accompanied him to the garrison, and<br/>
                    were introduced to the commanding officer,<br/>
<a href="/people/mpike1">Major Pike<persname key="mpike1"></persname></a>, who appears to be a genteel
                    and<br/> clever old man. He informed us that a public<br/> vessel would sail for
                        <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, about the first of<br/> the
                    ensuing month, and recommended us very<br/> strongly to take passage in her, in
                    preference to<br/> any other vessel, she being in good order, and<br/> under the
                    management of mariners well ac-<br/>quainted with the lake. This vessel is under
                    his<br/> superintendence.</p>
<p>Agreeably to engagement, we dined to-day with<br/><a href="/people/cjewi1">Charles
                        Jewett<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a>. The revenue officer for the port<br/> of <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/cerne1">Captian

<p>This day we dined with <a href="/people/mpike1">Major Pike<persname key="mpike1"></persname></a>, in<br/>
                    compliance with an invitation which he gave us<br/> yesterday. He treated us
                    with great respect and<br/> attention, and appeared to be pleased with our<br/>
                    company. <a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a> being the place of
                    his<br/> nativity, he has considerable knowledge of our<br/> Society. In the
                    course of conversation he in-<br/>quired after <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter
                        Yarnall<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a>, and says that <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a><br/> and himself were in the same military company<br/> during
                    the Revolutionary war; he had not heard<br/> of his death.</p>
<p>The following circumstance, as related by him,<br/> making at the time
                    considerable impression upon<br/> me, I have thought proper to record it. He
                    told<br/> us that several officers with <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a>
                    and himself<br/> were lodging together; that one night <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a><br/> alarmed them all with loud screams to such a
                    de-<br/>gree that on first awaking he supposed the enemy<br/> had fallen upon
                    their army with bayonets. <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a><br/> was on
                    his feet, and appeared to be awake. They<br/> spoke to him repeatedly, and
                    endeavored to ap-<br/>proach him, but every advance they made in-<br/>creased
                    his alarm. Finally he recovered himself<br/> and became composed, and for
                    several days after-<br/>wards, instead of satisfying their inquiries,
                    ap-<br/>peared to be sunk in distress and gloom. He<br/> afterwards told them he
                    considered his alarm as<br/> a warning to him, and that his fright arose
                    from<br/> a plain representation of the devil, come to take<br/> him off.
                        <a href="/people/pyarn1">Peter<persname key="pyarn1"></persname></a> in a short time left the army,<br/>
                    and (said the <a href="/people/mpike1">Major<persname key="mpike1"></persname></a>) I always believed that
                    his<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_106" n="106"></pb> reformation had its rise from that circumstance.</p>

<p>This day we dined with <a href="/people/rmonr1">Robert Monroe<persname key="rmonr1"></persname></a>,<br/>
                    factor of the United States in the Indian Depart-<br/>ment. At his table we met
                    our friend <a href="/people/cjewi1">Charles Jewett<persname key="cjewi1"></persname></a>, the revenue
                    officer before named, <a href="/people/jhenr1">Judge Henry<persname key="jhenr1"></persname></a> and

<p>This day we dined with <a href="/people/fbate1">Frederick Bates<persname key="fbate1"></persname></a>, at
                    his lodgings. He is descended from<br/> Friends, and discovers great partiality
                    for our<br/> company. He is a young man of superior under-<br/>standing, and is
                    much esteemed in <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. I<br/> feel and
                    fear for the situation of this young<br/> man. It is not in human nature to
                    support good<br/> principles unblemished, when left alone to stem<br/> the
                    torrent of fashionable and fascinating vices.<br/><a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> is a place of great corruption.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-04-30">30th.</date><placename key="detro"></placename></dateline>
<p>This day we rode nine miles up the<br/><geogname key="detror">river
                        Detroit</geogname> to take a view of <geogname key="lakst">Lake St.
                        Clair</geogname>.<br/> This lake is thirty miles in length, and twenty<br/>
                    miles in width. We had a beautiful prospect of<br/> it, from a commanding
                    situation. I ought to<br/> have mentioned that bordering the river, the<br/>
                    whole distance from <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> to the lake, the
                    land<br/> is handsomely improved. The houses are so<br/> near each other that
                    the margin of the river<br/> looks like a village. These farms are grants<br/>
                    made by the <a href="/organizations/lowcan">French government<orgname key="lowcan"></orgname></a> nearly a cen-<br/>tury ago. They uniformly lie in
                    parallelograms<br/> containing about one hundred acres. Added to<br/> tolerable
                    dwelling houses are the handsomest<br/>apple orchards I ever saw. The
                    extraordinary<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_107" n="107"></pb> healthfulness of the trees, indicates a
                    suitableness<br/> of climate or soil, or both.</p>
<p>The pear trees also are very large and hand-<br/>some; but their cherry and peach
                    trees do not<br/> thrive well, the climate being too cold for them.</p>
<p>In this little excursion we were accompanied<br/> by <a href="/people/fbate1">Frederick Bates<persname key="fbate1"></persname></a>, and returned in time to com-<br/>ply with an
                    invitation we had received to dine<br/> with <a href="/people/ddavi1">Doctor
                        Davis<persname key="ddavi1"></persname></a>. <a href="/people/mpike1">Major Pike<persname key="mpike1"></persname></a>, and

<p>We this day dined with <a href="/people/dwilk1">Dr. Wilkinson<persname key="dwilk1"></persname></a>, who
                    removed from the lower part of<br/> the State of <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>. Were we as fond of<br/> eating and drinking as the
                    people of <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> ap-<br/>pear to be, it
                    would be no marvel if we should<br/> forget our homes, and think ourselves well
                    enough<br/> entertained where we are; but whilst we have<br/> been under an
                    apparent necessity of yielding to<br/> the invitations we have received during
                    (shall I<br/> say?) our imprisonment here, we know we have<br/> been very
                    anxious for the time to arrive, in which<br/> we may embark homewards, and hope
                    that to-<br/>morrow morning the vessel for which we have<br/> been waiting will
                    sail.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-02">2d.</date><placename key="mald"></placename></dateline>
<p>This morning, wind and weather appear-<br/>ing to permit, we were informed that
                    at 9 o'clock<br/> the vessel would sail. We accordingly bade<br/>farewell to our
                    acquaintance, and went on board<br/> the United States brig called the John Adams,<br/> commanded by <a href="/people/hbrev1">Commodore Brevoort<persname key="hbrev1"></persname></a>. About 9<br/> o'clock sail was hoisted, and
                    we proceeded to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_108" n="108"></pb> the mouth of the <geogname key="detror">river
                        Detroit</geogname>, when night com-<br/>ing<br/> on, and the wind being
                    unfavorable, we<br/> anchored near the British shore, and opposite to<br/> the
                    town of <a href="/places/mald">Malden<placename key="mald"></placename></a>.</p>

<p>Weighed anchor. Winds light and op-<br/>posite; anchored again about 8 o'clock in
                    the<br/> evening, near an island called the <a href="/places/midsi">Middle

<p>About 4 o'clock this morning again<br/> weighed anchor, and a calm coming on
                    about 10<br/> o'clock, we anchored again near <a href="/places/midbi">Middle
                        Bass Island<placename key="midbi"></placename></a>, where we were confined the remainder<br/> of
                    the day. In the afternoon some of us amused<br/> ourselves with fishing. The
                    small boat was<br/> rowed by several hands around the island, whilst<br/> we
                    cast our lines, about thirty feet in length, hav-<br/>ing hooks baited with the
                    skin of pork and<br/> covered in part with the skin of pork and<br/> covered in
                    part with a piece of red cloth. In a<br/> short time we caught upwards of five
                    dozen<br/> black bass, justly esteemed an excellent fish, and<br/> weighing from
                    four to six pounds. The lake<br/> water is so clear, that fish can be seen
                    from<br/> twelve to fifteen feet below the surface. Many<br/> of the fish we
                    caught, we saw advancing to our<br/> hooks.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock this morning again hoisted<br/> sail. Weather windy, attended with
                    rain. We<br/> had not proceeded far before a head wind opposed<br/> our sailing,
                    and we cast anchor at an island<br/> called <a href="/places/middi">Middle

                    leagues<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_109" n="109"></pb> to a harbor called <a href="/places/putib">Put-in-Bay<placename key="putib"></placename></a>, where we lay dur-<br/>ing the night.</p>

<p> During last night lay at <a href="/places/presq1">Presqueile<placename key="presq1"></placename></a>,
                    and<br/> this morning put on shore the passengers bound<br/> for that place,
                    after which, the wind heading us,<br/> we lay at anchor the rest of the day.
                        <a href="/places/presq1">Presqueile<placename key="presq1"></placename></a><br/> is a town on the

                    are<br/> stores. A small garrison of the United States is<br/> stationed

<p>About 10 o'clock last night, a light favor-<br/>able breeze sprung up, which
                    encouraged us to<br/> proceed. The vessel has been all night and du-<br/>ring
                    the day under sail. At 8 o'clock in the<br/> evening we dropped anchor, within
                    four miles of<br/><geogname key="niagr">Niagara river</geogname>. Our commander
                    says that the<br/> channel leading into the harbor, is rocky and<br/> dangerous,
                    and deems it imprudent to attempt<br/> an entrance at night.</p>
<p>It is a pleasing reflection, that we are so near<br/> to the end of our passage
                    over the lake; and we<br/> are gladdened with the hope, that we shall
                    shortly<br/> prosecute the remainder of our journey over<br/> terra firma, where
                    we shall not be subject to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_110" n="110"></pb> the impediments of opposing winds,
                    and be freed<br/> from the dangers of storms. <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname> is a<br/> very beautiful body of water, 300 miles in<br/>
                    length and generally from 50 to 60 in width.<br/> Much of the distance we have
                    sailed has been out<br/> of sight of land. The water of the lake appears<br/> to
                    be of a beautiful deep green color, but when<br/> taken up in a glass vessel, is
                    to be admired for<br/> its transparency. I think it is, without exception,<br/>
                    the sweetest water I ever drank.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock this morning our anchor<br/> was again hoisted, and in about half an
                    hour we<br/> were safely moored at <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie.<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>
                    This is a small<br/> fort on the Canadian shore of the lake, garrison-<br/>ed by
                    the British. Immediately on our arrival,<br/> we set out on foot for <a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, distant 5 miles, a<br/> town situated at
                    the junction of <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogname><br/> with
                        <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>, and near the commencement
                    of<br/> the outlet of the lake, commonly called <geogname key="niagr">Niagara<br/> river</geogname>. The object of this excursion was to
                    ob-<br/>tain a conveyance across the country to the near-<br/>est line of public
                    stages. We were successful in<br/> an application to one of the inhabitants,
                    who<br/> agreed to furnish us with a light wagon, to be<br/> in readiness two
                    day's hence. Here we met with<br/><a href="/people/egran1">Erasmus

                    Indian<br/> affairs. He tells us that many individuals<br/> amongst the Indians

<p>About mid-day we returned in a small boat to<br/> our vessel. After dining on
                    board, we went on<br/> shore at <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>,
                    and joined by our <a href="/people/hbrev1">Commodore<persname key="hbrev1"></persname></a><br/> and <a href="/people/lcox1">Lieutenant Cox<persname key="lcox1"></persname></a>, a passenger with us from<br/>
<a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, we engaged a light wagon to return
                    with<br/> us at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning, to view the<br/>
<geogname key="niagf">Falls of Niagara</geogname>, distant about eighteen miles.
                    We<br/> extended our walk for a considerable distance<br/> along the shore of
                        <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>; it is here composed<br/> of a
                    solid body of limestone, beautifully marbled.</p>

<p>This morning we sat out for the <geogname key="niagf">Falls<br/> of
                        Niagara</geogname>; our road passed near the margin of<br/>
<geogname key="niagr">Niagara river</geogname>, from the lake to the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname>, a dis-<br/>tance of 18 miles, which afforded
                    us a view<br/> both of the river, and of the adjacent improve-<br/>ments. The
                    land is generally under cultivation,<br/> and is tolerably improved. The soil
                    appears<br/> rather cold and stiff; but some of the meadows<br/> are nearly
                    equal to the best I ever saw; some of<br/> the farms belong to members of our
                    society, and<br/> we are told that there is a meeting of Friends<br/> not far
                    distant from the Falls. Considerable<br/> emigrations are making from the United
                    States,<br/> to this as well as other parts of Upper <a href="/places/canad">Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a>,<br/> owing to the very advantageous terms upon<br/>
                    which the British Government dispose of the<br/> land, being scarcely removed
                    from a gift.</p>
<p>We reached a Canadian town called <a href="/places/chipp1">Chippewa<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a>,
                    <br/> to breakfast, after which we walked to the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname>,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_112" n="112"></pb> a distance of two miles. This was a
                    walk, of<br/> which every step seemed to increase curiosity<br/> and surprise.
                    Our attention was soon arrested<br/> by a cloud which hangs perpetually over the<br/>
<geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname> for the height of 600 feet, arising from
                    the<br/> dashing of the waters.</p>
<p>As we advanced to the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname> the solid earth<br/>
                    and rocks shook, or seemed to shake, under our<br/> feet, whilst the roar of the
                    waters so overpowered<br/> every other sound that, notwithstanding we were<br/>
                    tete-a-tete, it was necessary to raise the voice to<br/> a very loud key in
                    order to be heard. Mean-<br/>while the cloud above mentioned issued
                    contin-<br/>ually in what we sometimes hear called a Scotch<br/> mist.</p>
<p>There is a common saying, <q>Those who know<br/> no danger, fear none.</q> This
                    was our case on re-<br/>turning to the extremity of an overjutting rock,<br/>
                    called <geogfeat key="trock">Table Rock</geogfeat>, opposite to the great
                    cataract,<br/> in order to gratify our curiosity, in a peep down<br/> the
                    precipice which is more than 150 feet per-<br/>pendicular. In passing afterwards
                    a short dis-<br/>tance below this rock, we were alarmed with the<br/> discovery,
                    that the place on which we had stood<br/> was but a thin shell, the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname> having under-<br/>mined the rock for many feet.
                    Proceeding a<br/> little lower down the <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname>,
                    we again found that<br/> our second stand was almost as baseless. We<br/>
                    however supposed that the danger was not equal<br/> to our apprehensions, as the
                    names of great num-<br/>bers of visitors were cut in these rocks, near
                    their<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_113" n="113"></pb> extremities. I shall not attempt to give a
                    par-<br/>ticular description of the <geogname key="niagf">Falls of
                        Niagara</geogname>, which<br/> has been done by persons who have visited
                    them,<br/> for the especial purpose of gratifying the curious.<br/> After we had
                    gratified our curiosity in a view of<br/> them we returned to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, and after<br/> night were rowed in a
                    small boat to <a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> town,<br/> in order to
                    be in readiness for setting out home-<br/>ward in the morning.</p>

<p>The person who has engaged to take us<br/> on our journey this morning has
                    disappointed us.<br/> The circumstance is a trial, as we have become<br/> very
                    anxious to reach our homes. Being at lei-<br/>sure we accompanied the Indian
                    agent in a ride,<br/> four miles above <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo
                        Creek</geogname>, to an Indian vil-<br/>lage of the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, one of the tribes of the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six
                        Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>.</p>
<p>They are making considerable progress in<br/> agriculture, live in tolerable log
                    houses, and have<br/> a number of cattle, horses and hogs. We saw<br/> many of
                    them at work; they were preparing the<br/> ground for the plough by rolling
                    logs, taking up<br/> stumps, &amp;c. </p>
<p>We also saw among them a large plough at<br/> work, drawn by three yoke of oxen,
                    and attended<br/> by three Indians. They all appeared to be very<br/> merry, and
                    to be pleased with our visit. The<br/> land upon which these Indians are settled
                    is of<br/> a superior quality. We saw amongst them <a href="/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/farme1">Farmers
                        Brother<persname key="farme1"></persname></a>, and several other dis-<br/>tinguished Chiefs. Many of
                    these Indians wor-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_114" n="114"></pb> in their ears, and round their necks,
                    strung upon<br/> strings, several descriptions of Lake shells. Here<br/> we met
                    with <a href="/people/sacca1">Saccarissa<persname key="sacca1"></persname></a>, a principal chief of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscarora<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> tribe. He has come for the
                    purpose<br/> of being assisted by the agent in vesting fifteen<br/> thousand
                    dollars in the purchase of land from the<br/><a href="/organizations/hollco">Holland Land
                        Company<orgname key="hollco"></orgname></a>. They have greatly de-<br/>clined hunting, and are
                    becoming agriculturists.<br/> The <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscarora
                        Indians<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> removed from <a href="/places/ncaro">North
                        Caro-lina<placename key="ncaro"></placename></a> many years ago, and were received into the<br/>
                    then <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, or Iroquois Indians, who
                    gave<br/> them a small tract of country, which they now<br/> think wants
                    enlarging. It is a fact, that the<br/><a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six
                        Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a> have stock in the Bank of the<br/> United States to the
                    amount of more than one<br/> hundred thousand dollars, from which they draw<br/>
                    regular dividends. This is money which they<br/> received some years ago from
                    our Government<br/> for the sale of their lands.</p>
<p>The Chiefs and principal people took the advice<br/> of <a href="/people/gwash1">General Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, in making bank stock of<br/> their
                    money.</p>

<p>This morning we set out from <a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a><br/> in a
                    farm wagon drawn by two horses, and tra-<br/>velled 32 miles through a rough and
                    inferior<br/> country.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-14">14th.</date><placename key="batav"></placename></dateline>
<p>Proceeded 23 miles and reached <a href="/places/batav">Bata-via<placename key="batav"></placename></a>,
                    a new town, handsomely situated. We have<br/> had a muddy, disagreeable road,
                    through a coun-<br/>try too flat to be desirable. The land is pretty<br/> rich,
                    and very heavily timbered. We have been<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_115" n="115"></pb> all day followed by
                    millions of mosquitoes;<br/> crossed a handsome stream called the <geogname key="toncr">Tantawan-<br/>tae</geogname>, and were told at the Ford that a
                    little dis-<br/>tance above us 120 rattle snakes lay dead. These<br/> snakes
                    were killed by some fishermen with their<br/> spears, the warm weather having
                    brought them<br/> out of their dens. People are making settle-<br/>ments here
                    very rapidly.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1804-05-15">15th.</date><placename key="warnt"></placename></dateline>
<p>Travelled 33 miles, and lodged at <a href="/places/warnt">War-ner's
                        Tavern<placename key="warnt"></placename></a>. The land for the most part tol-<br/>erable. The New
                    England people are making<br/> many handsome settlements here. They have<br/>
                    built fine farm houses, planted handsome or-<br/>chards, and emigration is
                    increasing. The stone<br/> is mostly limestone. We passed for several miles<br/>
                    over a tract covered with limestone, which con-<br/>tained a great variety of
                    curious marine shells.<br/> The country affords many fine springs; one<br/>
                    which we passed contains water sufficient to turn<br/> a mill. We also passed
                    through a large Indian<br/> town, near the <geogname key="genes2">Genesee
                        river</geogname>, and to-day crossed<br/> that river, where its width is
                    about 100 feet.</p>

<div type="entry">

<p>At 6 o'clock this morning we again<br/> proceeded; passed near <geogname key="heml">Hemlock lake</geogname>, and<br/>
<geogname key="honeyl">Honey lake</geogname>, of which the waters empty into the<br/>
<geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname>. The face of the country is
                    gen-<br/>erally tolerable, but stony. We to-day also saw<br/> the same
                    appearances of marine shells as yesterday.<br/> About mid-day we reached the
                    town of <a href="/places/canan">Canan-daigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a>; situated upon a
                    lake of that name, about<br/> 20 miles in length, and from one to two<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_116" n="116"></pb> miles in width; its waters empty into <geogname key="lakeo">Lake<br/> Ontario</geogname>. The improvements on this tract are<br/>
                    astonishingly handsome for a new country, par-<br/>ticularly through a
                    settlement called <a href="/places/bloomf">Bloomfield<placename key="bloomf"></placename></a>.<br/> At
                        <a href="/places/canan">Canandaigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, we exchanged a rough
                    wagon,<br/> for the public stage, a circumstance additionally<br/> gratifying to
                    us from the hope that we shall now<br/> proceed homewards with expedition. At 2
                    o'clock<br/> set out in the stage, and reached the town of<br/><a href="/places/genev">Geneva<placename key="genev"></placename></a> where we lodged. This is a handsome<br/> new
                    town situated upon <geogname key="senec">Seneca lake</geogname>, a body of<br/>
                    water forty miles in length, and from three to<br/> three and a half miles in

<p>Travelled about fifty miles and lodged<br/> at the village of <a href="/places/onond">Onandagua<placename key="onond"></placename></a>. On our way we<br/> reached a handsome
                    wooden bridge one mile in<br/> length, over <geogname key="cayug1">Cayuga

<p>Travelled fifty miles to the handsome<br/> town of <a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a>, situated on the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk
                        river.</geogname><br/> Passed near <geogname key="oneil">Oneida
                        Lake</geogname>, and through a large<br/> settlement of Indians of the
                        <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida tribe<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>. Their<br/> town consists of
                    about seven hundred Indians.<br/> They have good houses, a meeting house,
                    barns<br/> and orchards. Their land is under cultivation,<br/> is level, and
                    appears to be of good quality. We<br/> saw many of them in their fields
                    preparing for<br/> corn. These Indians have been greatly aided in<br/>
                    agriculture, by the <orgname key="pym">Friends of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia.<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname></p>

<p>This morning we again proceeded, and<br/> at night lodged at a small village
                    called <a href="/places/geort">George-town<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, making a distance of
                    fifty miles. Our road<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_117" n="117"></pb> led us the whole distance along the
                        <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk<br/> river.</geogname></p>
<p>The Bottoms along this river are called the<br/><a href="/places/gefla">German
                        Flats<placename key="gefla"></placename></a>, and are very rich and handsome.<br/> They were settled
                    many years ago by the Germans.<br/> We stopped to view the Falls in the river,
                    where<br/> the navigation is made easy by locks; a very<br/> romantic place,
                    there being limestone rock of<br/> enormous size, both in the water and upon
                    the<br/> hills. In proceeding along the bottoms of this<br/> river there are
                    many marks which indicate that<br/> at some period of time there was a vast body
                    of<br/> water covering these Flats. The <a href="/places/gefla">Flats<placename key="gefla"></placename></a>
                    are gen-<br/>erally from half a mile to a mile in width; their<br/>margins are a
                    continuation of hills on each side,<br/>which are from two to three hundred feet
                    in<br/>height; the surface of the hills show stones of<br/> great size, which
                    are washed into all shapes;<br/> added to this, the hills discover evident
                    appear-<br/>ances of those indentures common to river shores. </p>

<p>Again prosecuted our journey, passing<br/> along the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk
                        river</geogname> to the town of <a href="/places/schen">Schen-ectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>, where we crossed the river, and in the<br/>

<geogname key="nrive">North river</geogname>, making a distance of forty
                    eight<br/> miles. I cannot but observe here, that in pro-<br/>ceeding along the
                        <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname> to-day, we came<br/> to the
                    end of those high chains of hills mention-<br/>ed yesterday, where the country
                    made quite a<br/> level appearance; so that we were puzzled to<br/> conjecture
                    what became of the earth which had <br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_118" n="118"></pb> enclosed so great a body
                    of water, as the hills<br/> seem to declare once washed their summits. I<br/>
                    may add, in humble confession, that in the course<br/> of our long journey, I
                    have had frequent occasions<br/> to acknowledge, in a view of those
                    extraordinary<br/> and inexplicable natural curiosities, which have<br/> fallen
                    under our observation, the truth of that<br/> excellent sentiment of a religious

                APPENDIX.
                <p>Whilst engaged in taking a copy of the pre-<br/>ceding journal, I have been
                    induced to examine<br/> the manuscripts left by the late <a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a>,<br/> of <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's
                        Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>, the companion in this em-<br/>bassy of the author of the
                    narrative, to discover<br/> if I could find amongst them any matter
                    concern-<br/>ing the Indians, and of the care manifested by<br/> the <a href="/organizations/bym">Friends of Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> on<br/> their
                    behalf. In the course of this investigation<br/> a variety of material on the
                    subjects mentioned<br/> has presented, from which I have gleaned some<br/>
                    fragments, which, as they promise to be inter-<br/>esting to the readers of the
                    present day, are<br/> herewith presented.</p>
<p>The first extracts are from the unpublished<br/> account of a journey to
                        <a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>, in <date when="1799">1799</date>,<br/> performed by some of the members of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">In-dian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> of <a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,<br/> and written by <a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a>. He appears<br/> to have considered
                    that any narrative of the<br/> kind should be preceded by information
                    con-<br/>cerning the Indians, as they were in former<br/> years; and had
                    therefore prepared a preface to<br/> this work, compiled from the writings of
                        <a href="/people/tjeff2">Jeffer-son<persname key="tjeff2"></persname></a>, and other authorities,
                    from which the fol-<br/>lowing is taken:</p>

                            the year <date when="1607">1607</date>,<br/> the country from the sea
                            coast to the mountains,<br/> and from the <geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname> to the most southern<br/> waters of <geogname key="jamer">James river</geogname>, was occupied by upwards<br/> of
                            forty different tribes of Indians. Of these,<br/> the <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatans<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a>, the <a href="/organizations/manah">Mannahoacs<orgname key="manah"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/monac">Mona-cans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a>, were the most powerful. Those
                            between<br/> the falls of the rivers and the mountains were<br/> divided
                            into two confederacies; the tribes in-<br/>habiting the head waters of
                            the <geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname> and<br/>
<geogname key="rappa">Rappahannock</geogname> being attached to the
                            Manna-<br/>hoars, and those on the upper part of <geogname key="jamer">James<br/> river</geogname> to the <a href="/organizations/monac">Monacans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a>. But the <a href="/organizations/monac">Monacans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a>
                            and<br/> their friends were in amity with the <a href="/organizations/manah">Mannahoars<orgname key="manah"></orgname></a><br/> and their friends, and waged joint and
                            perpetual<br/> war against the <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatans<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a>.
                            We are told that<br/> the <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatans<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a>,
                                <a href="/organizations/manah">Mannahoacs<orgname key="manah"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/monac">Monacans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a>,<br/> spoke languages so radically different,
                            that in-<br/>terpreters were necessary when they transacted<br/>
                            business. Hence we may conjecture that this<br/> was not the case
                            between all the tribes, and prob-<br/>ably that each spoke the language
                            of the nation<br/> to which it was attached, which is known to<br/> have
                            been the case in many particular instances.<br/> Very possibly there may
                            have been anciently<br/> three different stocks, each of which
                            multiplying<br/> in a long course of time, had separated into so<br/>
                            many little societies. This practice results from<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_122" n="122"></pb> the
                            circumstance of their never having submitted<br/> themselves to any
                            laws, any coercive power, or<br/> any shadow of government. Their only
                                con-straints<br/><del resp="undtermined">trasts</del> are their
                            manners, and that moral sense of<br/> right and wrong which, like the
                            sense of tasting<br/> and feeling in every man, makes a part of his<br/>
                            nature. An offence against these is punished<br/> by contempt, by
                            exclusion from society, or, where<br/> the case is serious, as that of
                            murder, by the in-<br/>dividuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as this
                            spe-<br/>cies of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare<br/> amongst
                            them, in so much that were it made a ques-<br/>tion whether no law, as
                            among the native Ameri-<br/>cans, or too much law, as among the
                            civilized Euro-<br/>peans, submits men to the greatest evil; one
                            who<br/> has seen both conditions of existence would pro-<br/>nounce it
                            to be the last, and that the sheep are<br/> happier of themselves, than
                            under the care of<br/> wolves. It will be said that great societies
                            can-<br/>not exist without the aid of government. The<br/> savages
                            therefore break themselves into small<br/> ones. The territories of the
                                <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatan<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a> confede-<br/>racy south of
                            the <geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname>, comprehended about<br/>
                            8000 square miles, 30 tribes, and 2400 hundred<br/> warriors. <a href="/people/jsmit6">Captain Smith<persname key="jsmit6"></persname></a> tells us that within<br/> 60
                            miles of <a href="/places/jtown1">Jamestown<placename key="jtown1"></placename></a> were 5000 people,
                            of<br/> whom 1500 were warriors. From this we find<br/> the proportion
                            of their warriors to their whole<br/> inhabitants was as 3 to 10.<br/>
                            The <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatan<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a><br/> confederacy then would
                            cosist of about 8,000<br/> inhabitants, which was one for every
                            square<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_123" n="123"></pb> mile; being about the twentieth part of
                            our<br/> present population in the same territory, and the<br/> hundreth
                            of that of the British Islands. The<br/> numbers of some of them are
                            stated as they<br/> were in the year <date when="1669">1669</date>, when
                            an attempt was<br/> made by the Assembly to enumerate them.<br/>
                            Probably the enumeration is imperfect, and in<br/> some measure
                            conjectural, and that a further<br/> search into the records would
                            furnish many more<br/> particulars. What would be the melancholy<br/>
                            sequel of their hsitory, may, however, be<br/> augured from the census
                            of <date when="1669">1669</date>, by which we<br/> discover that the
                            tribes therein mentioned and<br/> enumerated, were, in the space of 62
                            years re-<br/>duced to about one-third of their former number.<br/>
                            Spirituous liquors, the small pox, war, and an<br/> abridgment of
                            territory, to a people who lived<br/> principally on the spontaneous
                            productions of<br/> nature, had committed great havoc among them.<br/>
                            That the lands of this country (<a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>,) were<br/> taken from them by conquest, is
                            not so general<br/> a truth as is supposed. We find in our
                            histo-<br/>ries and records, repeated proofs of purchase<br/> which
                            cover a considerable part of the lower<br/> country, and many more would
                            doubtless be<br/> found on further search. The upper country,<br/> we
                            know, has been acquired altogether by pur-<br/>chases made in the most
                            unexceptionable form,<br/> westward of all these tribes, beyond the
                            moun-<br/>tains, and extending to the great lakes on the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/massaw">Massawomics<orgname key="massaw"></orgname></a>, a most powerful
                            confederacy, who<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_124" n="124"></pb> harassed unremittingly the <a href="/organizations/powh">Powhatans<orgname key="powh"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/manah">Man-nahoacs<orgname key="manah"></orgname></a>. These were probably the ancestors<br/>
                            of the tribes known at present by the name<br/> of the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>. Very little can now be
                            dis-<br/>covered of the subsequent history of these tribes<br/>
                            severally. The <a href="/organizations/chickah">Chickalaminies<orgname key="chickah"></orgname></a> removed about<br/>
<date when="1661">1661</date> to <geogname key="mattr">Mattapony

                            of the <a href="/organizations/pamun">Pamunkies<orgname key="pamun"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/matta">Mat-tahonys<orgname key="matta"></orgname></a>, attended the meeting at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, in<br/>
<date when="1685">1685</date>; this seems to be the last chapter in
                            their<br/> history. The <a href="/organizations/monac">Monacans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a> and
                            their friends, better<br/> known latterly by the name of <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroras<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a>, were<br/> probably connected
                            with the <a href="/organizations/massaw">Massawomics<orgname key="massaw"></orgname></a>, or<br/>
<a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>; for though we are told
                            that their<br/> languages were so different that the interven-<br/>tion
                            of interpreters was necessary between them,<br/> yet we also learn that
                            the <a href="/organizations/erigas">Erigas<orgname key="erigas"></orgname></a>, a nation for-<br/>merly
                            inhabiting the <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, were of the
                            same<br/> original stock with the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five
                                Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, and that<br/> they partook also of the <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscarora<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> language.<br/> Their dialects
                            might, by long separation, have<br/> become so unlike as to be
                            unintelligible to each<br/> other. We know, that in <date when="1712">1712</date>, the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Na-tions<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>
                            received the <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroras<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> in their
                            confede-<br/>racy, and made them the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Sixth
                                Nation<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>. All the<br/> nations of Indians in North America,
                            lived in<br/> the hunter's state, and depended for subsistence<br/> on
                            hunting, fishing, and the spontaneous fruits<br/> of the earth, and a
                            kind of grain, which was<br/> planted and gathered by the women, and is
                            now<br/> known by the name of Indian corn. Long po-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_125" n="125"></pb>tatoes, pumpkins, and squashes of various kinds<br/> were also found
                            in use among them. They had<br/> no flocks, herds, or tamed animals of
                            any kind.<br/> Their government a kind of patriarchal confede-<br/>racy.
                            Every town or family has a chief, who is<br/> distinguished by a
                            particular title, and whom we<br/> commonly call <said>Sachem.</said>
                            The several towns<br/> or families that compose the tribes have a
                            chief<br/> who presides over it, and the several tribes com-<br/>posing
                            a nation have a chief who presides over<br/> the whole nation. Those
                            chiefs are generally<br/> men advanced in age, and distinguished for
                            their<br/> prudence and abilities in council; the matters<br/> which
                            merely regard a town or family, are settled<br/> by the chief and
                            principal men of the town,<br/> those which regard a tribe, such as the
                            appoint-<br/>ment of head warriors or captains, and settling<br/>
                            differences between tribes and families, are reg-<br/>ulated at a
                            meeting of the chiefs from the differ-<br/>ent towns; and those which
                            regard the whole<br/> nation, such as making war, concluding peace,
                            or<br/> forming alliances with the neighboring nations.<br/> are
                            deliberated and determined in a national<br/> council, composed of the
                            chiefs of the tribes, at-<br/>tended by their head warriors, and a
                            number of<br/> chiefs from the towns, who are his counsellors.<br/> In
                            every town, there is a council house, where<br/> the chiefs and men of
                            the town assemble when<br/> occasion requires, and consult what is
                            proper to<br/> be done. Every tribe has a fixed place for the<br/> chief
                            of the towns to meet and consult on the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_126" n="126"></pb> business of
                            the tribe. And in every nation,<br/> there is what they call the central
                            council house,<br/> or council fire, where the chiefs of the
                            several<br/> tribes, with the principal warriors, convene to<br/>
                            consult and determine on their national affairs.<br/> When any matter is
                            proposed in the national<br/> council, it is common for the chiefs of
                            the seve-<br/>ral tribes to consult thereon apart with their<br/>
                            counsellors, and when they have agreed, to deliver<br/> the opinion of
                            the tribe at the national council.<br/> And as their government seems to
                            rest wholly<br/> on persuasion, they endeavor by mutual
                            conces-<br/>sions to obtain unanimity. Such is the govern-<br/>ment that
                            still exists among the Indian nations<br/> bordering on the United
                            States. To the north-<br/>ward of these, there was another powerful
                            nation,<br/> which occupied the country from the head of<br/> the
                                <geogname key="chesab">Chesapeake Bay</geogname>, up to the
                                <geogname key="kittam">Kittatinny<br/> mountain</geogname>, and as
                            far eastward as <geogname key="conntr">Connecticut<br/>
                            river</geogname>, comprehending that part of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>,<br/> which lies between the Highlands and the
                            ocean.<br/> All the State of <a href="/places/newje">New
                                Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>, that part of <a href="/places/penns">Penn-sylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> which is watered below the range of<br/>
<geogname key="kittam">Kittatinny Mountains</geogname>, by the rivers or
                            streams<br/> falling into the <geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>,
                            and the County of<br/>
<a href="/places/newcas">New Castle<placename key="newcas"></placename></a>, in the State of
                                <a href="/places/delaware">Delaware<placename key="delaware"></placename></a> as far as<br/>
<geogname key="duckc">Duck Creek</geogname>. It is to be observed that
                            nations<br/> of Indians distinguish their countries one from<br/>
                            another, by natural boundaries, such as ranges<br/> of mountains or
                            streams of water. But as the<br/> heads of rivers frequently interlock
                            or approach<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_127" n="127"></pb> near to each other, as those who live upon
                            a stream<br/> claim the country watered by it, they often
                            en-<br/>croached on each other, and this was a constant<br/> source of
                            war between the different nations.</p>
<p>The nation occupying the tract of country<br/> last described, called
                            themselves <a href="/organizations/delaware">Lenapi<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, and<br/> among us
                            they are better known as <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>;<br/> this nation consisted of five tribes, who all
                            spoke<br/> one language; first, the <a href="/organizations/chili">Chihohocki<orgname key="chili"></orgname></a>, who dwelt<br/> on the west side of the river,
                            now called <a href="/places/delaware">Dela-ware<placename key="delaware"></placename></a>, a name
                            given to it by <a href="/people/twest1">Lord De-la-War<persname key="twest1"></persname></a>,<br/>
                            who put into it on his passage from <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>,<br/> but which was called by the Indians,
                            Chicho-<br/>hocki. Second, the <orgname>Wanami</orgname>, who inhabited
                            the<br/> country called <a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>,
                            from the <geogname key="rarit">Raritan</geogname> to<br/> the sea.
                            Third, the <a href="/organizations/munseeind">Munsey<orgname key="munseeind"></orgname></a>, who dwelt on
                            the<br/> upper streams of the <geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>,
                            from the <geogname key="kittam">Kitta-<br/>tinny mountains</geogname>
                            down to the <geogname key="rarit"> Raritan.</geogname> Fifth, the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/mahican">Mahicon<orgname key="mahican"></orgname></a> or Mahattan, who occupied
                                <a href="/places/stati">Staten Isl-and<placename key="stati"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/yorki">York Island<placename key="yorki"></placename></a>, (which, from its being the
                            prin-<br/>cipal seat of their residence, was formerly called<br/>
                            Mahattan.) <a href="/places/longi">Long Island<placename key="longi"></placename></a>, and that part
                            of <a href="/places/newyo">N.

                            continuance of the <geogname key="kittam">Kittatinny ridge</geogname>
                            down to<br/> the sound. The nation had a close alliance<br/> with the
                                <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, who lived on the
                                <a href="/places/susqueh">Susque-hanna<placename key="susqueh"></placename></a> and to the
                            westward of that river, as far as<br/> the <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany mountains</geogname>, and carried on a long<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_128" n="128"></pb> war with another powerful nation of Indians,<br/> who
                            lived to the north of them, between the<br/>
<geogname key="kittam">Kittatinny mountains</geogname>, or highlands,
                            and <geogname key="lakeo">Lake<br/> Ontario</geogname>, and who call
                            themselves <a href="/organizations/mingo">Mingoes<orgname key="mingo"></orgname></a>, and<br/> are called
                            by the French writers, Iroquois, by<br/> the English, <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, and by the Indians to<br/> the
                            southward, with whom they were at war,<br/>
<a href="/organizations/massaw">Massawomic<orgname key="massaw"></orgname></a>; this war was carrying on in
                            its<br/> greatest fury, when <a href="/people/jsmit6">Captain
                                Smith<persname key="jsmit6"></persname></a> first arrived<br/> in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>. The <a href="/organizations/mingo">Mingo<orgname key="mingo"></orgname></a>
                            warriors had pene-<br/>trated down the <a href="/places/susqueh">Susquehanna<placename key="susqueh"></placename></a> to the mouth of<br/> it. The <a href="/organizations/mingo">Mingo<orgname key="mingo"></orgname></a> nation consisted of five tribes;<br/>
                            three, who are called the Elder, to wit: the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, who live to the west, the
                            Mohawks, to<br/> the east, and the <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondagoes<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> between them;<br/> and two, who are called the
                            younger tribes,<br/> namely, the <a href="/organizations/cayugaind">Cayugas<orgname key="cayugaind"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>. All
                            these<br/> tribes spoke one language, and were thus united<br/> in a
                            close confederacy, and occupied that tract<br/> of country from the last
                            end of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> to<br/>
<geogname key="lakec">Lake Champlain</geogname>, and from the <geogname key="kittam">Kittatinny</geogname> and<br/> highlands to the
                                <geogname key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogname> and the river<br/>
<geogname key="stlar">St. Lawrence</geogname>. This nation turned their
                            arms<br/> against the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Lenapi<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, and as
                            this war was long<br/> and doubtful, they, in the course of it, not
                            only<br/> exerted their whole force, but put in practice<br/> every
                            measure which prudence or policy could<br/> devise to bring it to a
                            successful issue. For<br/> this purpose they bent their course down the<br/>
<a href="/places/susqueh">Susquehanna<placename key="susqueh"></placename></a>, warring with the
                            Indians in their<br/> way, and having penetrated as far as the
                            mouth<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_129" n="129"></pb> of it, they, by the terror of their arms,
                            engaged<br/> a nation, known by the name of the <a href="/organizations/nanti">Nanticocks<orgname key="nanti"></orgname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/organizations/piscaind">Coneys<orgname key="piscaind"></orgname></a> and <orgname>Lutetocs</orgname>,
                            and who lived between<br/><geogname key="chesab">Chesapeake</geogname>
                            and <geogname key="delab">Delaware Bays</geogname>, and bordering<br/>
                            on the territory of <a href="/organizations/chili">Chihohocki<orgname key="chili"></orgname></a>, to enter
                            into an<br/> alliance with them; they also formed an alliance<br/> with
                            the <a href="/organizations/monac">Monahans<orgname key="monac"></orgname></a>, and stimulated them to<br/>
                            war with the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Lenapi<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, and their
                            confederates.<br/> At the same time the <a href="/organizations/mohawk">Mohawks<orgname key="mohawk"></orgname></a> carried on a<br/> furious war down the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname> against the <a href="/organizations/mahican">Mo-hiccons<orgname key="mahican"></orgname></a> and river Indians, and compelled
                            them<br/> to purchase a temporary and precarious peace,<br/> by each
                            acknowledging them to be their supe-<br/>riors, and paying an annual
                            tribute. </p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/delaware">Lenapi<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> being surrounded with
                            enemies<br/> and hard pressed, and having lost many of their<br/>
                            warriors, were compelled at last to sue for peace,<br/> which was
                            granted them on the condition that<br/> they should put themselves under
                            the protection<br/> of the <a href="/organizations/mingo">Mingoes<orgname key="mingo"></orgname></a>,
                            confine themselves to raising<br/> corn, hunting for the subsistence of
                            their fami-<br/>lies, and no longer have the power of making<br/>
                            war.</p>
<p>This is what the Indians call making them<br/> women. Under this
                            condition the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Lenapis<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> were<br/> when
                                <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> first arrived, and
                            began the<br/> settlement of <a href="/places/penn">Pennsylvania<placename key="penn"></placename></a> in the year <date when="1682">1682</date>.</p>
<p>In <date when="1700-09">Sept. 1700</date>, the Indians residing on the<br/>

                            permitted to settle about the head of <geogname key="potor">Potomac</geogname>,<br/> in <a href="/places/penn">Pennsylvania<placename key="penn"></placename></a>. The <a href="/places/cones2">Conestoga<placename key="cones2"></placename></a> chiefs, also,<br/> in 1701, ratified the

<p>The first movement made by the Society of<br/> Friends of <a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> for the<br/> benefit of the Indians,
                    after the conclusion of<br/> the Revolutionary was, was commenced about<br/> one
                    year subsequent to the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>;
                    <br/> whereby a peace had been concluded between<br/> the United States and the
                    hostile tribes, north-<br/>west of the <geogname key="ohior">river
                        Ohio</geogname>. For many years those<br/> Indians had proved themselves to
                    be the for-<br/>midable enemies of the white emigrants who<br/> settled near
                    them, and of the armies of the<br/> United States, sent out to compel them to
                    sub-<br/>mit to the occupation of a territory which they<br/> continued to
                    regard as their own property. Hav-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_132" n="132"></pb>ing been greatly improved in
                    warlike discipline,<br/> and in the use of European firearms, by serving<br/>
                    under the French commanders in former wars,<br/> they adhered to any pacific
                    agreements no longer<br/> than their fears or their interests restrained<br/>
                    them; and rested in the determination never to<br/> abandon their lands
                    northwest of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname>.<br/> They had
                    defeated <a href="/people/jharm1">General Harmer<persname key="jharm1"></persname></a>, with the<br/> loss of
                    the greater part of his army, on the banks<br/> of the <geogname key="stjos">St.
                        Joseph's river</geogname> in <date when="1791">1791</date>; and an
                    ex-<br/>pedition sent against them shortly after, under<br/> the command of
                        <a href="/people/gstcl1">General St. Clair<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>, was com-<br/>pletely
                    routed. In this engagement the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>,* <note rend="asterisk">* Michikiniqua, was the Indian
                        name of this chief.</note> so often alluded to in the foregoing<br/> pages,
                    was the commander-in-chief of the Indian<br/> forces, and displayed feelings of
                    humanity to-<br/>wards his retreating foes, of which few exam-<br/>ples have
                    been furnished in the history of Indian<br/> warfare, and which reflects honor
                    on his cha-<br/>racter.</p>
<p>On beholding the white soldiers fleeing before<br/> the exasperated Indians, and
                    at every moment<br/> cut down by the weight of their tomahawks, his<br/> heart
                    revolted at the sight, and ascending an<br/> eminence, he gave the <del resp="undetermined">singular</del> signal cry, which com-<br/>manded his men
                    to cease from further pursuit<br/> and return to their camps; he also sent out
                    mes-<br/>sengers to inform them, wherever scattered,<br/> that <said who="lturt1">they must be satisfied with the carnage,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_133" n="133"></pb>
                        having killed enough.</said> By this effort on his<br/> part many lives were
                    spared.</p>
<p>After this defeat, so unlooked for by the<br/> United States, <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>, who had suc-<br/>ceeded <a href="/people/gstcl1">General St. Clair<persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>, arrived with his army<br/> upon
                    the location where that officer had been<br/> defeated, in the <date when="1793-09">9th month, (Sept.) 1793</date>, and<br/> immediately built
                        <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>. The next year<br/> he brought
                    the Indians to a decisive engage-<br/>ment in the vicinity, in which they were
                    over-<br/>thrown with great slaughter. This humiliation<br/> lessened their high
                    estimate of their own strength<br/> and disposed them to peace, and a treaty
                    was<br/> concluded between them and <a href="/people/gwayn1">General
                        Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>,<br/> who acted as a commissioner of the United<br/>
                    States, at <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, (<date when="1794">1794</date>), by which the tribes<br/> northwest of the <geogname key="ohior">river Ohio</geogname>, gave up the lands<br/> so long the object
                    of contention, and accepting<br/> a reservation in the neighborhood of the
                    Lakes,<br/> came under the protection of the United States,<br/> upon terms at
                    that time considered mutually<br/> satisfactory and beneficial.</p>
<p>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, who appears to have had
                    a<br/> just idea of the importance of the lands about<br/> to be ceded to our
                    government, remained for a<br/> long time inflexible, resolved upon
                    procuring<br/> more favorable conditions. He was deeply at-<br/>tached to the
                    country which had been his birth-<br/>place, and in common with all his
                    brethren<br/> considered it belonged to the Indians by right<br/> of possession
                    from the Great Spirit, who, they<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_134" n="134"></pb> believed, after he had made
                    the earth, sun,<br/> moon and stars, had placed the red man on this<br/>
                    continent, and bestowed it upon him and his<br/> children. He knew also, that
                    the whole region<br/> around was made dear to them by every cher-<br/>ished
                    remembrance; their recollections of the<br/> happy abode of the red people
                    therein for many<br/> generations before the coming of the white men<br/> to
                    settle amongst them; as connected also with<br/> the sports and pastimes of
                    their youth, and with<br/> the enjoyments of their more manly pursuits in<br/>
                    maturer years, and moreover as containing the<br/> graves and other monuments of
                    their fathers.<br/> These recollections were all quickened and in-<br/>creased
                    in importance by the knowledge that, in<br/> relinquishing the possession of
                    this fine territory,<br/> they yielded up forests filled with herds of
                    deer,<br/> and other game which, by the addition of the<br/> fruits of their
                    grounds, rich and fertile almost<br/> without precedent, gave them, even with
                    their<br/> rude mode of tillage, an ample supply for their<br/> simple wants. He
                    seemed also to be filled with<br/> apprehension, lest when settled within the
                    con-<br/>fined boundaries, which were to be theirs by the<br/> conditions of the
                    treaty, that his countrymen<br/> would be too slow in adopting the habits of
                    civil-<br/>ized life; and as the supply of wild animals must<br/> soon be
                    exhausted, would suffer many privations<br/> in consequence of the change. As
                    such were<br/> his feelings, can any thoughtful person be as-<br/>tonished at
                    his resolutions?</p>
<pb facs="SW_GH1804_135" n="135"></pb>
<p>Convinced at last, that no alternative awaited<br/> him, he consented to sign the
                    compact, remark-<br/>ing to the officers present, as he affixed his
                    sig-<br/>nature, <said who="lturt1">I have been the last to consent to this<br/>
                        agreement; I will be the last to break it.</said> He<br/> remained true to
                    his affirmation.</p>

                            with regard to the In-<br/>dians commenced by a weighty concern
                            being<br/> opened, concerning the difficulties and distress<br/> to
                            which the Indian natives of this land are sub-<br/>ject; and many
                            observations were made on the<br/> kindness of their ancestors to the
                            white people,<br/> in the early settlement of this country,
                            exciting<br/> a deep consideration and enquiry, whether under<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_136" n="136"></pb> the influence of that exalted benevolence and<br/> good
                            will to men, (which our holy profession re-<br/>quires,) anything
                            remains for us to do to pro-<br/>mote their welfare, their religious
                            instruction,<br/> knowledge of agriculture, and the useful
                            me-<br/>chanic arts. A solemnity and uniting calm<br/> prevailing over
                            the meeting, the further consid-<br/>eration of the subject was referred
                            to another<br/> meeting, when the condition of the distressed<br/>
                            Indian natives being again revived, the senti-<br/>ments of many
                            brethren expressed, and a pre-<br/>vailing sympathy felt, it appears to
                            be the united<br/> sense of this meeting, that it be recommended<br/> to
                            our Quarterly and Monthly Meetings to take<br/> this concern into
                            serious consideration, and open<br/> subscriptions among our members for
                            their relief<br/> and the encouragement of school education,
                            hus-<br/>bandry, and the mechanic arts, amongst that<br/> people. As it
                            appears their situation demands<br/> immediate attention, we hope a
                            spirit of liber-<br/>ality will be manifested;* <note rend="asterisk">*

                                thus collected, do not appear to have been<br/> often used to defray

                    which convened at that place, a<br/> very serious consideration of the

<p>In the course of this journey, after having<br/> visited a number of
                            Indian hunting camps and<br/> several of their towns, we had a large
                            oppor-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_146" n="146"></pb>tunity to discover their present situation;
                            often<br/> exposed to the inclemency of the seasons, with<br/> a very
                            precarious and frequently a scanty sup-<br/>ply of food and clothing.
                            From the knowledge<br/> we have obtained of the extensive and
                            valuable<br/> country they have lately given up to the United<br/>
                            States, and of the narrow strip of land yet re-<br/>served for their own
                            use, between the line of<br/> the American garrisons and from <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> to the<br/> mouth of the <geogname key="kentr">Kentucky river</geogname>, we were im-<br/>pressed with
                            a belief that the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawa-nese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> who dwell there, will, unless<br/> they alter
                            their present mode of living, be re-<br/>duced, in a few years, from the
                            scarcity of game,<br/> to a state of extreme want and distress.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>At the upper end of <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky Town<placename key="sand"></placename></a>, they<br/>
                    held a council with two of the principal chiefs<br/> of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> and several of their<br/> former
                    warriors and young men, when <a href="/people/izane1">Isaac Zane<persname key="izane1"></persname></a>
                    interpreted to them the address prepared<br/> by the Friends of <a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>.<br/> He also interpreted the
                    reply of one of the<br/> Chiefs, which was brief but friendly.</p>
<p>They found that <said>the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> were the<br/>
                        principal nation; that everything of importance<br/> must be transacted in
                        their council; they can<br/> transact business by themselves, but the
                            <a href="/organizations/delaware">Dela-wares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> have to apply to them when<br/> any
                        business of consequence is laid before their<br/> people.</said></p>
<p>This reply of the Indians, was presented to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_147" n="147"></pb>
<a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> of Friends with the<br/>

                    Concerns<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>,<br/> and was published in the newspapers of the day. </p>
<p>Afterwards, at a meeting of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian

                    received a letter from <a href="/people/jheck1">John Hecke-welder<persname key="jheck1"></persname></a>,
                    agent for the <a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravian Society<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a>,
                    repre-<br/>senting the distressed condition of the Indians<br/> under his care,
                    in consequence of their having<br/> been driven from their settlement on the

                    and were<br/> now returning thereto in want of provisions and<br/> necessary

                        <a href="/people/jwrig2">Joel Wright<persname key="jwrig2"></persname></a> were appointed <said>to
                        inspect into the<br/> circumstances of those Indians, with liberty, if<br/>
                        they shall believe it necessary, to afford them<br/> some assistance by
                        furnishing them with such<br/> articles as they may be in immediate want
                        of.</said><br/> This delegation reported to the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Commit-tee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, at a meeting held in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> the <date when="1799-04-02">2d of<br/>

                    a<br/> supply of provisions for the winter before his<br/> departure, and that
                    the principal Indians of the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_148" n="148"></pb> settlement were then dispersed,
                    and at their<br/> hunting camps (no date given), they turned<br/> their
                    attention to eight of ten families of other<br/> Indians of the <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroras<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a>, who were very de-<br/>sirous of being
                    instructed in farming, but were<br/> without agricultural implements, and were
                    also<br/> in want of provisions; these they would have<br/> visited, in order to
                    meet their <said>active men,</said><br/> who had invited them to an interview,
                    but were<br/> prevented from doing so by the situation of the<br/>
<geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname>, which was in flood, with vast
                    masses<br/> of ice passing down it. They, however, left a<br/> supply for their
                    relief with <a href="/people/tsmit1">Thomas Smith<persname key="tsmit1"></persname></a>, who<br/> lived near
                        <a href="/places/geort">Georgetown<placename key="geort"></placename></a>, and also engaged a
                    black-<br/>smith to make them some farming utensils.<br/><a href="/people/rcadw1">Reese Cadwallader<persname key="rcadw1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jwrig2">Joel

                    be-<br/>lieved it would be right for the <orgname><a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a></orgname> to send a deputation to the
                    General<br/> Council of the Indians to be held the next<br/> spring.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee on Indian Concerns<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> met
                    again<br/> on the <date when="1799-03-23">23d of Third month, 1799</date>, being
                    a spe-<br/>cial meeting; when a letter from <a href="/people/twist1">Thomas

                    which was delivered at<br/>
<a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a> on behalf of the whole <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>,<br/> on the <date when="1798-09-08">8th day of September, 1798</date>, reminds<br/> the Friends that they once
                    met the Indians at<br/> a certain place <said who="tarh1">where a great many
                        good things<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_149" n="149"></pb> were said and much friendship professed
                        between<br/> them; that they had no place of security for<br/> their
                        speeches, as their white brethren had, and<br/> that their belts of wampum
                        were their only re-<br/>cords;</said> and adds, <said who="tarh1">but, if
                        you examine your<br/> books and papers, you will there find written all<br/>
                        that passed between your forefathers and ours.</said><br/> He speaks further
                    of a <said who="tarh1">belt of wampum given<br/> to us by your forefathers, with
                        a piece of parch-<br/>ment affixed thereto; when you see the belt of<br/>
                        wampum and read the writing on the parch-<br/>ment, you no doubt will then
                        perfectly know us,<br/> and will consider us as brethren united by a
                        chain<br/> of friendship which can never be broken whilst<br/> memory
                        lasts.</said> He informed the Friends that<br/> he understood some of them
                    wished to pay his<br/> people a visit, and adds, <said who="tarh1">We are much
                        pleased<br/> to hear that you still hold us in remembrance.</said></p>

<opener><salute>Dear Friends,-</salute></opener>
<p>The correspondence has,<br/> on our part, been suspended till the
                            account<br/> should be received from the Western Indians,<br/> which is
                            now communicated by you; they pro-<br/>bably conceiving that Friends,
                            wherever situ-<br/>ated, act as one body united. As the <a href="/organizations/pym">Friends of <orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> have had a correspondence
                            with<br/> them at times, from the first settlement of the<br/> country,
                            and as they, in their present address,<br/> have alluded to former
                            transactions, it seems<br/> the more necessary for us to apply to you
                            for<br/> information on that head. We have been aware<br/> of our own
                            inability at present to do any great<br/> matters, and have endeavored
                            to guard against<br/> raising their expectations. A speech was some<br/>
                            time ago communicated to some of the chiefs<br/> of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> nation, at the <a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>,<br/> with a view to inform
                            them that we were de-<br/>sirous of turning their minds to some of
                            the<br/> most simple arts of civil life; and we wished<br/> to know of
                            them whether it would be agreeable<br/> to them to make such a movement.
                            They in-<br/>formed us that they would lay the subject be-<br/>fore
                            their council and return an answer. A<br/> copy of the speech was left
                            with them addressed<br/> to the chiefs of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> and<br/>

<p>We should have been pleased with the re-<br/>ception of the original

                            of which you will<br/> please inform the Superintendent,* <note rend="asterisk">* The seat of Government of the United States

                            may conceive to be necessary. We<br/> also suggest the propriety and
                            usefulness of<br/> your appointing a few Friends to unite in the<br/>
                            visit, since the prudent conducting of the mat-<br/>ter may be of great
                            importance.</p>
<p>As you are better acquainted than we are<br/> with the mode of conducting
                            business with the<br/> Indians, if you think a belt of wampum will
                            be<br/> necessary on our part, you will please to pro-<br/>cure one for
                            us suitable for the purpose, to be<br/> forwarded with the original
                            speech and belt<br/> received by you, and we will remit the amount<br/>
                            so soon as you advise us thereof.</p>

<p>The deputation left their homes on the <date when="1799-05-07">7th of<br/> 5th
                        mo. 1799</date>, on horse-back and with pack<br/> horses to carry a tent,

                    settlements of Friends of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, and useful

                    as the subject has not been al-<br/>luded to before in this Appendix, that of
                    all the<br/> missions we have referred to as sent out by the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> of <a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,<br/> the Friends engaged in them
                    travelled on horse-<br/>back, and experienced privations which in this<br/> day
                    of railroads and telegraphs cannot be appre-<br/>ciated. Valuable gifts for
                    their Red brethren,<br/> their wives, and children, were never omitted on<br/>
                    these occasions.</p>
<p>At the next meeting of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian
                        Commit-tee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, which was held in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, the <date when="1799-10-16">15th</date> and<br/>
<date when="1799-10-16">16th of 10th month, 1799</date>, the Friends who
                    had<br/> been appointed to visit the Indians made their<br/> report, viz:
                        <said>Pursuant to our appointment we<br/> sat out on a visit to the Indians,
                        the <date when="1799-05-07">7th of 5th<br/> month last</date>, and arrived
                        the <date when="1799-06-03">3d of the next<br/> month</date> at <a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>, the principal village<br/> of
                        the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>; we were met there by a<br/>
                        friendly reception from <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie, (the
                            Crane,)<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> the<br/> head chief, and others of the nation who
                        hap-<br/>pened to be at the village.</said></p>
<p>On conferring with them they found that a<br/> mistake in translating their
                    language had led to<br/> a misunderstanding respecting the time of hold-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_155" n="155"></pb>ing the Grand Indian Council, which they now<br/> understood began
                    every year at the full moon,<br/> in the 6th month; they were, therefore,
                    too<br/> early in their visit, and with the impossibility<br/> of collecting the
                    other Indians who would not<br/> be likely to assemble until the council,
                    they<br/> concluded to hold a conference with <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> and<br/> the other chiefs then at <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>, in his house;<br/> and had a free conference with
                    them on the sub-<br/>ject of their visit. Their communication was<br/> kindly
                    received, and an answer delivered on<br/> four strings of wampum, expressive of
                    their<br/> gratitude for the care and friendship of the<br/> Quakers;* <note rend="asterisk">*<a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a> continued ever
                        after to devote himself to<br/> the improvement of his people, and lived to
                        be the<br/> oldest Indian in the West. He had signed a treaty<br/> between
                        the United States and the Indians as early<br/> as <date when="1786">1786</date>, and although obliged by his warriors to take<br/> part in
                        the revolt which soon after took place, and<br/> in the battles subsequently
                        fought, he appears to<br/> have been the first to persuade the Indians to
                        make<br/> a virtue of neccesity, to <said>bury the hatchet,</said> and<br/>
                        yield to the superior power of the white men. He<br/> was cruelly executed
                        by the order of <a href="/people/tecum1">Tecumseh<persname key="tecum1"></persname></a>, in<br/><date when="1810">1810</date>.</note> and as soon as the Grand Council<br/>
                    met, they would communicate to it the concern<br/> the Friends now felt for
                    their improvement, and<br/> inform us by a written speech of their
                    conclu-<br/>sion thereon.</p>
<p>They conclude their report by remarking:</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>While we were at <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a> and in other
                            In-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_155" n="155"></pb>dian villages, our minds were often deeply
                            af-<br/>fected under the sorrowful consideration of the<br/> baneful
                            effect of spirituous liquors on them, being<br/> abundantly supplied
                            with it in almost every vil-<br/>lage by Canadian traders residing among
                            them;<br/> and we are confirmed in the opinion, that unless<br/> the
                            traders can be restrained from furnishing<br/> them with this
                            destructive article, in exchange<br/> for their skins and furs, they
                            will not easily be<br/> persuaded to turn their minds towards
                            agricul-<br/>ture and the useful arts. At the same time, we<br/> have no
                            doubt that these unprincipled men will<br/> make use of the great
                            influence they have over<br/> the Indians to keep them in their present
                            mode<br/> of living, as most conducive to their own in-<br/>terests.
                            Notwithstanding this cause of dis-<br/>couragement, the great affection
                            which the In-<br/>dians have always manifested for our Society,<br/>
                            induces us to desire that Friends may endeavor<br/> to keep under the
                            weight of the concern, and<br/> be prepared to proceed in the benevolent
                            work<br/> before them, whenever the way may open for<br/> service among
                            them.</p>

<floatingtext type="undetermined">
<p>After <a href="/people/ethom1">Evan Thomas<persname key="ethom1"></persname></a> had concluded his
                            dis-<br/>course, which was delivered by paragraphs<br/> through an
                            interpreter, <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie, (the Crane,)<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a>
                            the<br/> principal chief, took into his hand four strings<br/> of
                            wampum, and began his speech. As he<br/> proceeded, he continually kept
                            the strings of<br/> wampum moving, and spoke in a methodical<br/> way,
                            and with the force and manner of an orator.<br/> I make no doubt, if the
                            interpreter had been<br/> able to do justice to the sentiments
                            expressed,<br/> we should have pronounced a verdict highly in<br/> favor
                            of the eloquence of this son of the forest.</p>
<p>After he had finished his speech, he desired<br/> his wife (who occupied
                            an apartment above the<br/> council room, so situated that she could
                            hear<br/> what passed), to hand down to him the papers,<br/> which he
                            had; which she did. We read them,<br/> and found among them <a href="/people/gwayn1">Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>'s treaty, and a<br/> long paper
                            containing much good advice from the<br/> Secretary of War.</p>
<p>When the Indians hold a council, they have<br/> some of their principal
                            women placed in a little<br/> room, either adjourning or overhead, where
                            they<br/> can hear perfectly all that passes. This they<br/> treasure up
                            in their minds, and as they are apt<br/> to have retentive memories,
                            their traditions are<br/> faithfully preserved.</p>

                    special one, and held at <geogname key="pikec">Pike Creek</geogname>, the <date when="1802-05-24">24th of<br/> the 5th month, 1802</date>. This meeting was
                    called<br/> in consequence of a part of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> hav-<br/>ing had a conference with a number of
                    Indian<br/> chiefs in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. The chiefs
                    were on their<br/> way to <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, the seat
                    of Government,<br/> and were waited on at their lodgings, the<br/> Fountain Inn,
                    Light Street, by the members of<br/> the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian
                        Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> and
                        <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>, to confer with
                    them on subjects of deep im-<br/>portance to their Red brethren, viz: the
                    introduc-<br/>tion into their tribes of some of the arts of civil-<br/>ized
                    life, and to remonstrate against the use of<br/> spirituous liquors. The
                        <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a> members pre-<br/>sented to the
                    General Indian Committee the<br/> whole account of their conference, and
                    the<br/> memorial they had presented to Congress<br/> against the introduction
                    of spirituous liquors<br/> into the Indian settlements. As the account of<br/>
                    the conference was published in several of the<br/> newspapers, I give the
                    following extract from one<br/> of them:</p>

<p>Besides the members of the Society of Friends,<br/> many respectable persons of
                    different religious<br/> persuasions were present, and the communica-<br/>tions
                    were taken down with accuracy by <a href="/people/ghopk1">Gerard T.

                    afterwards been adopted by one of the chiefs,<br/> and continued to reside

                    and being possessed of good talents, not only<br/> spoke the language of the

<p>Brothers and Friends: I am desirous in the<br/> early part of this
                            opportunity, that you may be<br/> informed, that the people called
                            Quakers con-<br/>sider all mankind as their brothers: that they<br/>
                            believe the Great Spirit and Father of all man-<br/>kind created all men
                            of one blood; and that it<br/> is the will of Him who also created the
                            sun,<br/> the moon, and the stars, and causes them to give<br/> us
                            light,-the Great Spirit and common Father<br/> of all mankind,-that we
                            should not do one another<br/> hurt, but that we should do one another
                            all the<br/> good we can; and it is on this ground, and this<br/>
                            principle, that we believe it right to take you by<br/> the hand.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>Then after a short time spent in silence, an-<br/>other member of the Society of
                    Friends, <a href="/people/jmcki1">John M'Kim<persname key="jmcki1"></persname></a>, spoke, declaring
                        <said who="jmcki1">that the Quakers be-<br/>lieved it required of them to
                        love all men,<br/> without reference to location or complexion;<br/> that
                        they were convinced it was not in their<br/> power to perform their
                        religious duties to the<br/> Great Creator of all things without his
                        assistance,<br/> and therefore felt it their duty, when entering<br/> upon
                        such important business as that in which<br/> they were about to engage, to
                        sit down in<br/> stillness and wait upon Him.</said> After some-<br/>thing
                    more on this subject, and a reference to<br/> the <orgname key="pym">Yearly
                        Meetings of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname> and
                        <orgname key="bym"><a href="/places/balti1">Balti-more<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></orgname>, he proceeded to say that <said who="jmcki1">the Friends re-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_161" n="161"></pb>membered the friendship which
                        had subsisted<br/> between their Society and the Indians, from<br/> their
                        first settlement in America; and recollect-<br/>ing that the Western country
                        was fast filling up<br/> with white people, and that game would
                        ne-<br/>cessarily become scarce, they feared the Indians<br/> would be
                        brought into a state of suffering.<br/> That, in consequence of the long
                        wars that had<br/> subsisted between them and some of the white<br/> people,
                        the Friends for a long time had not had<br/> an opportunity of taking them
                        by the hand.<br/> That so soon as an opportunity had presented,<br/> after a
                        peace was effected, a concern had arisen<br/> in their council, and several
                        Friends were ap-<br/>pointed to go out into the wilderness and have a<br/>
                        talk with them.</said> He then called upon the<br/> Friend who sat at his
                    right hand, <a href="/people/ethom1">Evan Thomas<persname key="ethom1"></persname></a>,<br/> who had been one
                    of the mission to the Plains<br/> of <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>,
                    to give an account of the move-<br/>ment in this concern. <a href="/people/ethom1">Evan Thomas<persname key="ethom1"></persname></a> then gave<br/> a very concise relation of the
                    journey, and the<br/> conference with the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> Chiefs, (which<br/> has been before alluded to, and of
                    which a<br/> narrative was published some years since by<br/>
<a href="/people/pthom1">Philip E. Thomas<persname key="pthom1"></persname></a>,) and proceeded to inform
                    the<br/> deputation that the Friends had received no re-<br/>sponse to the
                    proposals then made to the In-<br/>dians; but a belt of wampum and a speech
                    had<br/> been sent them from a council held at <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>,<br/> and an invitation to attend their General
                    Coun-<br/>cil. After he had concluded, another member<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_162" n="162"></pb> of the
                    Indian Committee, <a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a>,
                    ad-<br/>dressed the chiefs as follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1801-12-26"></date></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends: We were glad when<br/> we heard that some of our
                            Red brethren were<br/> coming to this city, and felt our minds
                            drawn<br/> to take them by the hand, and have an oppor-<br/>tunity of
                            knowing them. As we have not been<br/> made acquainted with their
                            circumstances, we<br/> have not been able to judge whether any
                            thing<br/> we have had to propose to do for them would be<br/> accepted?
                            Whether they are really under the<br/> necessity of applying to some
                            other mode of<br/> living to obtain a livelihood, and whether game
                            in<br/> their country is yet plenty? We have thought,<br/> brothers,
                            that if it should not yet be the case,<br/> that game is scarce, at the
                            present time, it will<br/> probably be the case in some future time;
                            and,<br/> therefore, we have thought it would be best for<br/> our Red
                            brethren to give some attention to the<br/> cultivation of the soil.
                            This is one of the subjects<br/> which has claimed our attention; and as
                            we feel<br/> in our hearts that we love the Indians and desire<br/>
                            their welfare, we wish to turn their attention to the<br/> subject; we
                            also believe, brothers, that we<br/> derive a very great advantage from
                            reading<br/> books which contain instruction, we wish that<br/> our
                            brethren, the Indians, should partake of the<br/> same means of
                            instruction with ourselves. We<br/> wish you to let us know with candor,
                            whether<br/> you desire these things, and if you do so, that<br/> we may
                            do for you whatever may be in our<br/> power.</p>

<p>After a short pause, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>
                    inquired<br/> if the Friends had any thing more to say, and<br/> being told that
                    we were all willing to listen to<br/> him, he rose up and said:</p>
<p><said who="lturt1">Brothers and Friends: My heart returns<br/> thanks to the
                        Great Spirit above, that has put it<br/> in our power to speak to each
                        other. My<br/> brother chiefs and myself are glad that our<br/> Friends and
                        brothers, the Quakers, have such<br/> great compassion for their Red
                        brethren.</said> He<br/> then spoke of the belief of the Indians, <said who="lturt1">in<br/> one Great Creator of all the men upon the<br/> earth,
                        and who were made when the earth, the<br/> sun, moon, and stars were also
                        made, to be useful<br/> to them and give them light.</said> After
                    referring<br/> to the desire of the Friends to benefit the In-<br/>dians, and
                    their need of that assistance, he<br/> added: <said who="lturt1">You have been
                        kept in the straight<br/> path by the Great and Good Spirit. We<br/> have
                        been led astray by inferior spirits: we<br/> now hope that we may come upon
                        your track,<br/> and follow it.</said> He then said <said who="lturt1">the
                        long and<br/> destructive wars that have raged in the country<br/> of our
                        Red brethren, since your fathers first<br/> came amongst them, have caused
                        their numbers<br/> to be greatly diminished. Those that have come<br/> among
                        us, have very much cheated and imposed<br/> upon us. They found us simple
                        and ignorant,<br/> and have taken great care to keep every thing<br/> from
                        us, in order to profit by our ignorance.</said></p>

<p>Friends and Brothers,-We find you are now<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_164" n="164"></pb> disposed,
                            with open arms to receive us, and we<br/> hope the Great Spirit will

<p>Brothers and Friends,- At the Treaty of<br/>
<a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, which is now a little
                            past six years,<br/> we received some presents by the hand of the<br/>
                            Great War Chief of the Americans (<a href="/people/gwayn1">General
                                Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>)-said to be sent to us by our brothers<br/> the
                            Quakers. After this Treaty I was invited<br/> by the Great War Chief of
                            the Americans to<br/> visit them. It is now four years since I
                            visit-<br/>ed them in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                            whilst the Great Coun-<br/>cil was held in that city. I had there an
                            oppor-<br/>tunity to see our brothers the Quakers, and re-<br/>ceived
                            from their mouths some of their talks:<br/> all these talks I wrapped up
                            in my heart, and<br/> when I returned home to my brothers I told<br/>
                            them all those good things which you had told<br/> us you were desirous
                            to do for us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,-I am happy to say<br/> that these my Red Brothers
                            now present with<br/> me are Chiefs, who in their own country are<br/>
                            equally great with myself; they were rejoiced to<br/> hear your words
                            delivered to them through me<br/> four years ago; and they are equally
                            glad with<br/> myself to hear from the mouths of our brothers<br/> the
                            Quakers the same good words again. If we<br/> understand you right, you
                            wish to add comfort<br/> to our women and children by teaching us
                            and<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_165" n="165"></pb> them some of your ways of living. I am

                            sorry that your efforts have not yet been<br/> successful.</p>

                            of Indi-<br/>ans, and if you wish to do any thing for any of<br/> these
                            nations we will at all times be ready to<br/> render any assistance in

<p>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> then again alluded to the
                    plea-<br/>sure they had received from the words of the<br/><a href="/organizations/pym">Friends of Philadelphia<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>, and
                    were equally pleased<br/> to hear the same good words from the <a href="/organizations/bym">Friends of of Baltimore<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>. He then mentioned that the <a href="/organizations/pym">Friends of <orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> had given them some tools, among<br/>
                    which were <said who="lturt1">two ploughs.</said>* <note rend="asterisk">*
                        Alluded to in the letter of <a href="/people/twist1">Thomas
                        Wistar<persname key="twist1"></persname></a>.</note>
<said who="lturt1">I used them,<br/> and did all I could to keep them from
                        wearing<br/> out; I was pleased with them; they now need<br/> repair; we
                        have nobody among us that can mend<br/> them, and they are now useless to
                        me.</said> He<br/> then referred to a visit they had made to <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> five days since, and the talks
                    they had had<br/> together with the Quakers there, had concluded<br/> by
                    inviting the <orgname key="bym">Friends of <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></orgname> to meet the<br/> Indian tribes at their
                    next Great Council, held<br/> annually at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                        Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, at the time the Indians<br/> receive their annuities from
                    the United States;<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_166" n="166"></pb> and requested that any information intended
                    for<br/> them should be conveyed to them through their<br/> interpreter,
                        <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, Indian agent at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>After taking his seat, this chief appeared to<br/> have reflected that he had not
                    answered fully<br/> the questions proposed to them, and rising again,<br/>
                    said:</p>
<p><said who="lturt1">Brothers and Friends: It is the real wish<br/> of your
                        brothers, the Indians, to engage in the<br/> cultivation of our lands, and
                        although the game<br/> is not yet so scarce but that we can get enough<br/>
                        to eat, we know it is becoming scarce, and that<br/> we must begin to take
                        hold of such tools as we<br/> see are in the hands of the white
                        people.</said> After-<br/>wards he alluded in forcible language to the
                    con-<br/>fidence which the Red men had in the Friends,<br/> and that they knew
                    they desired no compensa-<br/>tion for their services to them, and added, <said who="lturt1">Bro-<br/>thers, we are a jealously disposed
                        people-almost<br/>every white man that comes among us endeavors<br/> to
                        cheat us; this has occasioned jealousy among<br/> us. But your talks,
                        brothers, are different, and<br/> we believe you.</said></p>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> then made a speech, in<br/>
                    which he reiterated much that the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a><br/> had spoken, and continued:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1801-12-26"></date></dateline>
<p>Friends and Broth-<br/>ers, the talks that you have now delivered to<br/>
                            us shall be carefully collected, wrapped up and<br/> put in our
                            hearts,-we will not forget them.<br/> On our return home, we will have
                            them com-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_167" n="167"></pb>municated from the head to the mouth of<br/>
                            the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>,-from this to the <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>, and<br/> up that river until it
                            strikes the lakes, thence<br/> round by <a href="/places/michi">Michillimackanack<placename key="michi"></placename></a> until they come<br/> back again to
                            the same place. What we say to<br/> you does not come from one, but from
                            many,<br/> and what you have now said to us, you speak it to<br/> but a
                            few, but it shall be communicated to many.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends, I observed to our<br/> friends, the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>, five days<br/> ago, what I say
                            now to you, that we wish our<br/> brothers, the Quakers, to render us
                            those services<br/> they have proposed. We promise that nothing<br/>
                            shall be wanting on our part to give aid to so<br/> desirable a thing in
                            our country. Our situation<br/> at present will not admit of carrying
                            such a<br/> plan so fully into execution as we could desire,<br/> but I
                            hope you may not be prevented from ma-<br/>king trial. If we had such
                            tools as you make<br/> use of, and which add so much to your
                            comfort-<br/> for we have been lost in wonder at what we have<br/> seen
                            among you,-if we had these instruments,<br/> we should, I hope, be
                            willing to use them.</p>
<p>From the great things, and astonishing<br/> wonders, which we have seen
                            among you, and<br/> finding they all come out of the earth, it
                            makes<br/> me anxious to try if I cannot get some for my-<br/>self.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>He then expressed his regret that the move-<br/>ments of the Friends towards the
                    Indians had<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_168" n="168"></pb> not met with the success which they deserved,
                    allu-<br/>ding to their having received no satisfactory re-<br/>ply from the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, and<br/> concluded with observing, <said who="fmeda1">There is a great<br/> deal, brothers, in having a good interpreter,
                        and<br/> beginning at the right end of the business.</said><br/> [The Indian
                    Committee who had had the inter-<br/>view with <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie,

                    speech to the Indians was not clearly<br/> translated, of which a hint had been
                    given, and<br/> hence the remarks of the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                        Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>.]</p>
<p>Here the interview with the Indians closed.</p>
<p>After reflecting on the subject of their con-<br/>ference with the Indian Chiefs,
                    the members of<br/> the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>
                    regretted that they had<br/> not made use of that opportunity to express<br/>
                    their opinion on the subject of the use of spirit-<br/>uous liquors. Another
                    meeting of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> and their
                    friends was accordingly called,<br/> and the chiefs were invited to attend. They
                    met<br/> again at the dwelling of <a href="/people/etyso1">Elisha
                    Tyson<persname key="etyso1"></persname></a>. After a<br/> brief representation of the reason for
                    another<br/> interview given by a friend, <a href="/people/ethom1">Evan
                        Thomas<persname key="ethom1"></persname></a> ad-<br/>dressed the chiefs in a forcible
                    communication,<br/> which was full of feeling; after assuring them<br/> that the
                    love he felt for the Indians, and his<br/> interest in their welfare, had taken
                    away all<br/> fear of giving them offence, he proceeded to ac-<br/>knowledge
                    what he had witnessed in his visit to<br/> the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot
                        Nation<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and his belief that the too<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_169" n="169"></pb> frequent use
                    of spirituous liquors was more in<br/> the way of their improvement than
                    anything<br/> else, and appealed to them thus: <said who="ethom1">Are you
                        of<br/>the same mind with us who are your friends, and<br/> have your good
                        at heart; that it would be right<br/> for us to take the subject into our
                        serious con-<br/>sideration, to endeavor to discover whether<br/> there may
                        not be some steps taken that would<br/> put a check upon this pernicious
                        thing?</said></p>
<p>After calling upon the chiefs to express them-<br/>selves freely in regard to the
                    concern, the<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> inquired if any
                    of his broth-<br/>ers, the Quakers, had any further communica-<br/>tion to make,
                    and being desired to proceed, rose<br/> up and said:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">

<p>Brothers and Friends, I am<br/> happy to find it has pleased the Great
                            Spirit,<br/> that we should again meet in the same house in<br/> which
                            we held our council yesterday. I am<br/> happy to find that it is the
                            will of the Great<br/> and Good Spirit that we should discover that<br/>
                            there was something omitted yesterday, that<br/> was highly necessary
                            for your red brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and brothers, I am glad to find that<br/> it has pleased the
                            Great Spirit to put a wish in<br/> your hearts on the subject you have
                            mentioned;<br/> a subject of the greatest importance to us.<br/> What
                            you have said relative to our being one<br/> flesh and blood is true.
                            Your brothers, the In-<br/>dians, believe that it is in this light the
                            Great<br/> Spirit considers all mankind.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> He afterwards<br/> remarked, that the Indians had long been aware<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_170" n="170"></pb> of the great evils which had <said who="lturt1">raged</said> in
                    their<br/> country, but could obtain no redness; that since<br/> the
                    introduction of spirituous liquors among<br/> them, their numbers were greatly
                    diminished,<br/> and taking advantage of the request which had<br/> been made,
                    that they should express themselves<br/> freely, added:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1801-12-26"></date></dateline>
<p>I will now take the liberty to<br/> mention, that most of the evils
                            existing among<br/> the Red people, have been caught from the white<br/>
                            people; not only that liquor which destroys us<br/> daily, but many
                            diseases that our forefathers were<br/> ignorant of, before they saw
                            you.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends:-I am glad you have<br/> seen this business as we
                            do, and rejoice to find<br/> that you agree in opinion with us, and
                            express<br/> an anxiety to be, if possible, of service to us,<br/> to
                            remove this great evil out of our country; an<br/> evil that has had so
                            much ruin in it,-that has<br/> destroyed so many of our lives, that it
                            causes our<br/> young men to say, <said>We had better be at war<br/>
                                with the white people.</said> This liquor that they<br/> introduce
                            into our country, is more to be feared<br/> than the gun or the
                            tomahawk; there are more<br/> of us dead since the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, than<br/> we lost by the years
                            of war before, and it is all<br/> owing to the introduction of this
                            liquor among<br/> us. This subject, brothers, composes a part of<br/>
                            what we intend to make known to the Great<br/> Council of our White
                            brethren. On our arrival<br/> there, we shall endeavor to explain to our
                            Great<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_171" n="171"></pb> Father, the President, a great many evils
                            that<br/> have arisen in our country, from the introduc-<br/>tion of
                            this liquor by the white traders. </p>
<p>Brothers and Friends: In addition to what<br/> I have observed of this
                            great evil in the<br/> country of your red brethren, I will say
                            further,<br/> that it has made us poor. It is this liquor that<br/>
                            causes our young men to go without clothes, and<br/> our women and
                            children to go without anything<br/> to eat, and sorry I am to mention
                            now to you,<br/> brothers, the evil is increasing every day, as the<br/>
                            white settlers come nearer to us, and bring those<br/> kettles they boil
                            that stuff in they call whiskey,<br/> of which our young men are so
                            extremely fond.<br/> Brothers, when our young men have been out<br/>
                            hunting, and are returning home loaded with<br/> skins and furs, on
                            their way, if it happened that<br/> they come along where some of this
                            whiskey is<br/> deposited, the White man who sells it, tells them<br/>
                            to take a little drink; some of them will say<br/> no, I do not want it;
                            they go on until they<br/> come to another house, where they find more
                            of<br/> the same kind of drink; it is there again offered,<br/> they
                            refuse, and again the third time; but<br/> finally the fourth or fifth
                            time, one accepts of it<br/> and takes a drink, and getting one, he
                            wants<br/> another, and then a third, and fourth, till his<br/> senses
                            have left him. After this, reason comes<br/> back to him; when he gets
                            up and finds where<br/> he is, and asks for his peltry, the answer is,
                            you<br/> have drunk them. Where is my gun? It is<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_172" n="172"></pb> gone.
                            Where is my blanket? It is gone.<br/> Where is my shirt? You have sold
                            it for<br/> whiskey! Now, brothers, figure to yourselves<br/> what a
                            condition this man must be in;<br/> he has a family at home, a wife and
                            children,<br/> who stand in need of the profits of his hunting,<br/>
                            what must their wants be, when he himself is<br/> also without a shirt.
                        </p>

<p>After expressing his<br/> hope that the Great Spirit would aid the<br/> Friends
                    in their efforts to assist the Indians, and<br/> that they would use any
                    influence they possessed<br/> with the great council of the United States
                    on<br/> their behalf, and again alluding to the baneful<br/> effects of
                    spirituous liquors, and the bad advice<br/> of wicked men who wished to keep
                    them in ig-<br/>norance, he finished by declaring that he desired<br/> all that
                    he had said should be made public,<br/> provided the Friends had no objection
                    thereto. </p>
<p>The <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a> then rose and said:-<said who="fmeda1">My<br/> Brothers and Friends: I have nothing to say on<br/> the
                        subject we have now been talking over. My<br/> friend, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, has given you a full<br/> answer
                        to those things you have mentioned to<br/> us; we are but one people, and
                        have but one<br/> voice. We hope, brothers, that your friendship<br/> and
                        ours may never be broken.</said></p>
<p><a href="/people/ethom1">Evan Thomas<persname key="ethom1"></persname></a>, then adressed them again as<br/>
                        follows.-<said who="ethom1">Friends and Brothers: What you<br/> have
                        communicated at this time, has been<br/> clearly understood, and we are glad
                            to find we<br/> see things in the same light that you see them.<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_173" n="173"></pb> The several matters you have mentioned, and<br/> the
                        difficulties you have stated, claim our sym-<br/>pathy and solid
                        consideration, and we shall, I<br/> trust, take the subject up, and if way
                        should<br/> open for us to move forward, in aiding you in<br/> your
                        application to the General Government, we<br/> shall be willing, either on
                        this occasion, or any<br/> other, to render you any service in our
                        power.</said><br/> The conference then broke up, and the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> prepared and forwarded to
                    the Con-<br/>gress of the United States, the following me-<br/>morial.</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><salute>To the Congress of the United States:</salute></opener>
<p>The memorial of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee appointed for
                                Indian affairs<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> by the <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly Meeting
                                of Friends held in <orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>, respectfully
                            repre-<br/>sents:</p>
<p>That a concern to introduce amongst some<br/> of the Indian tribes
                            north-west of the <geogname key="ohior">river Ohio</geogname>,<br/> the
                            most simple and useful arts of civil life,<br/> being several years
                            since laid before our <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,
                            a <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> was appointed by
                            that<br/> body, to visit them, to examine their situation,<br/> and
                            endeavor to ascertain in what manner so<br/> desirable a purpose could
                            be effected. A part<br/> of that <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, after having obtained the<br/> approbation of
                            the President of the United<br/> States, proceeded to perform the
                            service assigned<br/> them, and the result of their enquiries and
                            ob-<br/>servations, as reported to the <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly
                                Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,<br/> was, that the quantity of spirituous liquors
                            with<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_174" n="174"></pb> which the Indians are supplied, by traders,
                            and<br/> frontier settlers, must counteract the effect of<br/> every
                            measure, however wise and salutary,<br/> which can be devised to improve
                            their situa-<br/>tion.</p>
<p>The truth of this assertion is abundantly<br/> confirmed by a speech made
                            before us, by a<br/><a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> chief, the
                                <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, (of which we<br/>
                            herewith transmit a copy for your consideration.)<br/> and we also
                            acknowledge our belief, that the<br/> evil is of such magnitude, that
                            unless it can be<br/> altogether removed or greatly restrained, no<br/>
                            national hope of success in the proposed under-<br/>taking can be
                            entertained. We are therefore<br/> induced to solicit the attention of
                            the National<br/> Legislature to this interesting and important<br/>
                            subject; a subject which we consider involves,<br/> not only their
                            future welfare, but even their very<br/> existence as a people.</p>

<p>These Friends soon after repaired to the seat<br/> of government, presented their
                    memorial to<br/> Congress, and were gratified by the passage of<br/> the law,
                    which they so much desired. Whilst<br/> in <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a> they waited on the Secretary of<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_175" n="175"></pb>
                    War. The law passed by Congress, authorized<br/> the President of the United
                    States <said who="undetermined">to take<br/> such measures from time to time, as
                        to him may<br/> seem expedient, to prevent or restrain the vend-<br/>ing or
                        distributing of spirituous liquors, among<br/> all or any of the Indian
                        tribes.</said></p>
<p>On the subject of civilization the law states<br/>
<said who="undetermined">that in order to promote civilization amongst<br/> the
                        friendly Indian tribes, and to secure the con-<br/>tinuance of their
                        friendship, it shall be lawful<br/> for the President of the United States
                        to cause<br/> them to be furnished with useful domestic ani-<br/>mals, and
                        implements of husbandry, and with<br/> goods or money as he shall judge
                        proper, and to<br/> appoint such persons from time to time, as
                        tem-<br/>porary agents to reside amongst the Indians, as<br/> he shall think
                        fit; provided that the whole<br/> amount of such presents and allowance to
                        such<br/> agents shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars<br/> per

<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> reported their progress to

                    and informed them of the<br/> conferences which had been held with the

                    interview with the Sec-<br/>retary of War, with the information received<br/>
                    from him. The War department at this period<br/> of the government of the United
                    States had the<br/> care of Indian affairs, and the Secretary informed<br/> the
                    Friends that, agreeably to the request of the<br/> Indians, the government had
                    established a tra-<br/>ding house at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort

                        <a href="/people/eelli1">Elias Ellicott<persname key="eelli1"></persname></a> had<br/> been Treasurer of

<p>The Friends who accomplished this journey<br/> together have now for many years
                    been num-<br/>bered with the dead. <a href="/people/gelli1">George

                        <date when="1834-03-27">27th of 3d month, 1834</date>,<br/> in the 66th year
                    of his age.</p>
<p><a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, who accompanied them to<br/>
<a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> with the intention of
                    instructing<br/> the Indians in agriculture, faithfully performed<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_181" n="181"></pb> the duty, so far as he alone was concerned. The<br/>
<a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> had in one of his interviews
                    with<br/> the Friends told them <said who="lturt1">our young men are not<br/> so

<a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> found this represen-<br/>tation
                    of them fully verified in his experience.<br/> After he had, with some
                    assistance from the In-<br/>dians, enclosed his plantation with a rude
                    fence,<br/> only one, or at the most two of the red men<br/> evinced any
                    disposition to labor. They would<br/> take a seat either on the fence, or in the
                    trees,<br/> near the premises, and watch him with apparent<br/> interest in his
                    daily engagement of ploughing<br/> and hoeing, but without offering to lend a
                    help-<br/>ing hand. He found the land very fertile, and<br/> raised a large crop
                    of corn and other products,<br/> which, after gathering into a storehouse he
                    built<br/> for the purpose in the autumn, he left in charge<br/> of some of the
                    neighboring chiefs for a winter<br/> supply for the necessitous members of the
                    tribes<br/> for whom he had labored, and returned to his<br/> home at <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>.</p>
<p><a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> lived some years afterwards,<br/>
                    a respectable member of the Society of Friends,<br/> and died on his farm in

<p>The promise made at the commencement of<br/> the foregoing brief history of the
                        <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> of <a href="/organizations/bym">Baltimore Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>, from its<br/> appointment in

                    this Appendix have been already exceeded; but<br/> the very interesting
                    character of the concern in-<br/>duces me (before producing a copy of the
                    Trea-<br/>ty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, which from its
                    influence on the<br/> condition of the Indian Tribes ought to be pre-<br/>sented
                    to the reader) to add the following ac-<br/>count.</p>
<p>From the last meeting of the committee, as<br/> above related, in <date when="1804">1804</date>, to the commencement of<br/> the war with <a href="/places/gbrit">Great Britain<placename key="gbrit"></placename></a>, the affairs of the<br/> Indians
                    continued to increase in importance, and<br/> their friends were frequently
                    flattered with the<br/> hope of a successful and permanent settlement of<br/>
                    the Tribes, to whom the United States under<br/> certain conditions had
                    guaranteed their lands, in<br/> the neighborhood of the Lakes.
                    Philanthropists,<br/> not only in our country, but, also, of the<br/> more
                    enlightened European nations, continued<br/> to accord to the efforts of the
                    Friends of this<br/> country the meed of their approbation, and from<br/>
                    members of the Society of Friends in <a href="/places/gbrit">Great
                        Britain<placename key="gbrit"></placename></a>, the <orgname key="pymind">Indian Committees of
                            <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname> and
                        <orgname key="bymindian"><a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></orgname> recieved donations of<br/> money, paid to
                    them in two instalments of several<br/> thousand dollars each, to be applied to
                    the im-<br/>provement of the condition of the Indians, which<br/> greatly
                    increased their opportunities of useful-<br/>ness; to these donations was
                    afterwards added<br/> a bequest from a friend of <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, of much less<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_183" n="183"></pb> amount, it is true,
                    but, nevertheless, a valuable<br/> contribution to the cause of humanity.</p>
<p>Portions of these different sums of money were<br/> faithfully applied, with
                    those collected from<br/> their own members, in giving encouragement<br/> to the
                    civilization of the Indians; in the pro-<br/>motion of a good system of
                    agriculture; in sup-<br/>porting schools; in building small mills for<br/>
                    grinding Indian corn, and in endeavoring to<br/> discountenance the hard
                    servitude of their<br/> women.</p>

                    to<br/> be applied in accordance with the instructions<br/> received for its

                    Cana-<br/>dian frontier, by the war with the British na-<br/>tion, produced its
                    effect on the friendly tribes,<br/> and, after much consultation among
                    themselves,<br/> and repeated visits of Chiefs to <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>,<br/> they concluded to cede all the lands to

                            friendly Indians except himself and<br/> the <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a>, had persuaded him to make the<br/> journey,
                            hoping he would discover, as he passed<br/> along, so many evidences of
                            the strength of the<br/> people he professed to despise, as to be
                            induced<br/> to prefer peace to war, on any terms. No favor-<br/>able
                            change, however, had been the result. He<br/> had refused every civility
                            tendered him while in<br/><a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>,
                            remaining shut up with his wife,<br/> in his apartments, while all the
                            rest of his com-<br/>panions partook of every enjoyment offered
                            them.<br/> He had refused to meet the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian
                                Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a><br/> in <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, (but was afterwards induced to do<br/> so,)
                            and remained in the same mood on his arri-<br/>val at <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>; and although <a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a> assured him he could
                            promise him a<br/> welcome and kind treatment at his house, he<br/>
                            still declined. The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>
                            endeavored to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_186" n="186"></pb> change his purpose; rallied him on his
                            obsti-<br/>nacy, ill-humor and laziness, and told him he<br/> was too
                            large a man to give so poor a display of<br/> Indian politeness, and
                            that he would return to<br/> his home in the same state of ignorance in
                            which<br/> he had left it; but all to no purpose. He bore<br/> the
                            raillery with apparent good humor, but re-<br/>mained unmoved. <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a> was of very large<br/> stature, and in
                            the prime of manly vigor. His<br/> dress was entirely made up of the
                            skins of wild<br/> animals, which had been killed by his own<br/>
                            hands.</p>
<p>Having heard so much of the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>,<br/> I determined to be present when he and
                            the<br/> other Chiefs were introduced at the house, where<br/> they were
                            to be entertained as guests. He was<br/> the first to enter the parlor,
                            and bowed grace-<br/>fully as he was introduced to the family, and<br/>
                            made a short address, in which he acknowledged<br/> the pleasure it
                            afforded him thus to meet the<br/> wife and children of a friend to whom
                            he felt<br/> obliged, and of whom he entertained the highest<br/>
                            opinion.</p>
<p>The interpreter then introduced the rest of<br/> the party, who shook
                            hands, and took their seats.<br/> Afterwards a pleasant conversation
                            took place<br/> between the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> Chiefs,
                            the Interpreter, and<br/> some of the residents of the village, in
                            which<br/> the Indians drew a comparison between savage<br/> and
                            civilized life, and in favor of civilization.<br/> The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> was anxious to have a
                            flour<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_187" n="187"></pb> mill erected in his town, and appeared
                            earnestly<br/> desirous of promoting the improvement of his<br/> people.
                            The <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, the <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a> and his<br/> wife, and the <a href="/people/beav1">Beaver<persname key="beav1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/crow1">Crow<persname key="crow1"></persname></a> listened in<br/> silence.</p>
<p>The dress and mantle of the <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a> bore
                            a<br/> close resemblance to those worn by <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a>,<br/> and were of similar material. He was
                            esteemed<br/> the greatest hunter of the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Potowatomies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>, and<br/> occasionally visited the <geogname key="rockm">Rocky Mountains</geogname> in<br/> pursuit of game, and
                            on his last excursion to<br/> that distant range, had killed a grizzly
                            bear of<br/> immense weight and size, whose skin, dressed<br/> with the
                            claws and teeth attached, he wore on<br/> this occasion, thrown over his
                            shoulders. His<br/> face was painted; the cheeks and forehead<br/>
                            black, and across one of his cheeks was a heavy<br/> dash of vermillion,
                            which looked like a deep and<br/> gaping flesh wound. His hair, which
                            was thick<br/> and coarse, was cut about six inches long in<br/> front,
                            and hung about his face, but was its full<br/> length behind, and tied
                            in several places with<br/> bands of buckskin, and powdered with red
                            paint;<br/> and he wore on the top of his head, a small<br/> coronet of
                            eagle's feathers, Attached to an<br/> embroidered belt hung his tobacco
                            pouch, made<br/> of the entire skin of a beaver, and by its side<br/>
                            his tomahawk and scalping knife. </p>
<p>With his large and muscular proportions, ac-<br/>companied by the
                            disfigurements of the paint,<br/> he was only saved from the appearance
                            of a bar-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_188" n="188"></pb>barous and unrelenting savage, by a
                            countenance<br/> expressive of the utmost good humor.</p>
<p>The wife of the <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a> was a young and
                            hand-<br/>some woman, of a modest and downcast expres-<br/>sion. She did
                            not seem to entertain the preju-<br/>dices against civilized
                            manufactures, which ex-<br/>isted in her husband's mind, and wore a
                            blue<br/> cloth habit, though made in Indian style; a hat,<br/> covered
                            with braided ribbon, feathers of different<br/> sorts, and tinsel
                            ornaments. Her moccasins were<br/> beautifully embroidered with moose
                            hair, inter-<br/>spersed with plaited rows of porcupine's quills;<br/>
                            her necklace was made of several rows of beads<br/> of many colors, and
                            her ear ornaments, which<br/> were drooping, and hung nearly down to
                            her<br/> shoulders, were also of beads; and she wore,<br/> wrapped
                            around her person, a fine Makinaw<br/> blanket.</p>
<p>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/rushe1">Rusheville<persname key="rushe1"></persname></a>, the <a href="/people/beav1">Beaver<persname key="beav1"></persname></a><br/> and <a href="/people/crow">Crow<persname key="crow"></persname></a>,
                            and the two <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, were
                            dressed<br/> in a costume usually worn by our own citizens<br/> of the
                            time: coats of blue cloth, gilt buttons,<br/> pantaloons of the same
                            color, and buff waistcoats;<br/> but they all wore leggings, moccasins,
                            and large<br/> gold rings in their ears. The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> ex-<br/>ceeded all his brother Chiefs in
                            dignity of ap-<br/>pearance-a dignity which resulted from the<br/>
                            character of his mind. He was of medium<br/> stature, with a complexion
                            of the palest copper<br/> shade, and did not wear paint. His hair
                            was<br/> a full suit, and without any admixture of grey,<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_189" n="189"></pb> although from what he said of his age, at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, in <date when="1804">1804</date>,
                            being then fifty-three, he must<br/> at this time have been fifty-seven
                            years old.<br/> His dress was completed by a long, red, military<br/>
                            sash around the waist, and his hat (a chapeau<br/> bras) was ornamented
                            by a red feather. Imme-<br/>diately on entering the house, he took off
                            his<br/> hat, and carried it under his arm during the<br/> rest of the
                            visit. His appearance and manners,<br/> which were graceful and
                            agreeable, in an un-<br/>common degree, were admired by all who
                            made<br/> his acquaintance.</p>
<p>When seated at table they seemed to enjoy the<br/> repast which was set
                            before them. A large<br/> dish of hominy- a national dish with the
                            In-<br/>dians- had with a variety of other dishes been<br/> served up,
                            especially in reference to their tastes,<br/> and was acceptable to
                            them. The <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a>,<br/> on taking his
                            seat, immediately pointed it out to<br/> his wife, who sat at his side,
                            and spoke for the<br/> first time since his entrance, to request to
                            be<br/> helped bountifully to the hominy, having seen<br/> nothing he
                            liked so well since he had left the woods.</p>
<p>The visit ended very agreeably; the deputa-<br/>tion shook hands with the
                            Friends who had en-<br/>tertained them, and returned to their
                            hotel.<br/> They found <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a> and his
                            wife quietly seated<br/> by the fireside, but soon understood they
                            had<br/> just returned from a walk, having passed the<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_190" n="190"></pb>
                            day on the hills, and in the fields on the banks<br/> of the <geogname key="patapr">Patapsco</geogname>.</p>
<p>We were told that they spent a part of the<br/> day seated upon the
                            rocks, contemplating the<br/> scenery before them; they were afterwards
                            at-<br/>tracted to a point where hickory nuts and per-<br/>simmons were
                            abundant, and the Chief was seen<br/> climbing the trees, and gathering
                            the persim-<br/>mons and nuts, and throwing them down to his<br/> wife,
                            who seemed fond of them. Thus, they had<br/> passed the day, and looked
                            refreshed thereby.</p>
<p>Both <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a> and the <a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a>, whilst on their<br/> journey, were
                            careful to present themselves, on<br/> all occasions, where there was a
                            chance of their<br/> being seen, painted and adorned in their most<br/>
                            approved style. Thus, while in <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a><br/> and <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, although in comparative retire-<br/>ment, as
                            he did not go out, <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a> was said
                            to<br/> spend two or three hours daily, in the duties of<br/> the
                            toilet, painting his face, dressing his hair,<br/> and arranging his
                            appearance, by a small mirror,<br/> held up before him by his wife, who
                            stood near him<br/> for the purpose, pronouncing occasionally on
                            the<br/> effect produced, and giving instructions. Similar<br/>
                            attentions were conferred by the wife of the<br/>
<a href="/people/rave1">Raven<persname key="rave1"></persname></a> on her husband, but as he was of
                            lower<br/> rank, and rather older than <a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a>, his toilet<br/> was less elaborate, and occupied
                            less time.</p>
<p>The next day after this ramble, the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Potawo-
                                tamies<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> all went together to visit the places where<br/>
<a href="/people/marp1">Marpau<persname key="marp1"></persname></a> and his wife had walked the day
                            before.<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_191" n="191"></pb> The other Indians, with the interpreter,
                            examined<br/> all the objects of interest in the neighborhood.<br/> They
                            had begun to be aware of the importance<br/> of mechanical operations,
                            and spoke with as<br/> much approbation as an Indian ever speaks of<br/>
                            things which he admires, of the ingenuity ex-<br/>hibited in the flour
                            and paper mills. The next<br/> day all the deputation left for their
                            homes in the<br/> west.</p>
<p>About a week subsequent to their departure,<br/> a member of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Indian Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> on passing<br/> by the
                            hotel at <a href="/places/ellic">Ellicott's Mills<placename key="ellic"></placename></a>, saw the
                            western<br/> public stage arrive with a party of Indians and<br/> their
                            interpreter, and was much surprised to find<br/> among them the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> Chief, the <a href="/people/beav1">Beaver<persname key="beav1"></persname></a>.<br/> The <a href="/people/beav1">Beaver<persname key="beav1"></persname></a>, according to the statement of the,<br/> interpreter,
                            had left his party at <a href="/places/cumb">Cumberland<placename key="cumb"></placename></a>,<br/>
                            and had joined the present deputation in order<br/> to present the
                            grievances of his nation to the atten-<br/>tion of the President of the
                            United States. For<br/> several years their annuities, both as
                            regarding<br/> goods and money, had been badly paid, and during<br/> his
                            recent visit to <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a><br/> had uniformly objected to
                            allude to the subject,<br/> under various pretexts. The <a href="/people/beav1">Beaver<persname key="beav1"></persname></a> thought<br/> there was something wrong
                            somewhere, and was<br/> determined to seek redness. The interpreter<br/>
                            asked advice of the Friend who met him at the<br/> hotel, and was
                            encouraged to make a faithful<br/> statement of wrongs done to the
                                <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>
<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_192" n="192"></pb> tribe. An investigation was made in <a href="/places/wash">Washing-ton<placename key="wash"></placename></a> by the President's
                            orders.</p>
<p><a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> was found to be a
                            defaulter<br/> to a large amount, and was discharged from the<br/>

                            and in <date when="1811">1811</date>, joined the party of<br/><a href="/people/tecum1">Tecumseh<persname key="tecum1"></persname></a> and the <a href="/people/tensk1">Prophet<persname key="tensk1"></persname></a>, in their warfare<br/> against the United
                            States, very contrary to the<br/> desires of the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, who with his allies<br/> had remained
                            deaf to all the arguments of <a href="/people/tecum1">Te-

<p><a href="/people/wwell1">William Wells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a> after a short residence in<br/>
<a href="/places/canad">Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a>, was taken prisoner by the

                            death with great barbarity. The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little

<p>The following matters of interest in the his-<br/>tory of the Indians, together
                    with the copy of<br/> the Treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, has been kindly fur-<br/>nished from the records
                    of <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, by a<br/> gentleman of that
                    city. </p>
<p>The treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>* <note rend="asterisk">*The treaty purports to have been made at<br/>
<said who="undetermined"><a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>,</said> but the place is frequently,
                        perhaps<br/> most generally, written <said who="undetermined"><a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>.</said></note> was concluded
                    on<br/> the <date when="1795-08-03">3d day of August, 1795</date>, at the Head
                    Quar-<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_193" n="193"></pb>ters of <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Anthony
                        Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>, commanding<br/> the army of the United States, northwest
                    of the<br/><geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, between that officer, acting
                    as Commission-<br/>er for the United States, and the Sachems, Chiefs<br/> and
                    warriors of twelve tribes of Indians. The<br/> treaty was mainly the result of a
                    victory ob-<br/>tained by <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> over
                    the Indians in a<br/> battle fought the previous year, near the <geogname key="miamr">Mau-<br/>mee</geogname>* <note rend="asterisk">* At the time of
                        the treaty called the <geogname key="miamr">Miami of the<br/>
                            Lake</geogname>.</note> river, and terminated the hostilities which<br/>
                    for nearly twenty years had been carried on be-<br/>tween the Indians, northwest
                    of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, and<br/> the white settlers in
                        <a href="/places/kentu">Kentucky<placename key="kentu"></placename></a> and western <a href="/places/virgi">Vir-ginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>. Sundry abortive efforts had been
                    made<br/> by the government to procure peace. Partial<br/> treaties were entered
                    into, which had no<br/> effect in restraining the great body of the tribes,<br/>
                    and several military expeditions, which had been<br/> sent into their country to
                    subdue them, met with<br/> disasters, and by their failure only
                    strengthened<br/> the Indians. In <date when="1793-04">April, 1793</date>, three
                    Commission-<br/>ers, with ample powers, were sent to negotiate a<br/> treaty,
                    and were intrusted to offer much better<br/> terms than were afterwards granted
                    the Indians<br/> by the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>. In the instructions<br/> given them it was stated,
                        <said who="undetermined">that the Society of<br/> Friends had, with the
                        approbation of the President<br/> of the United States, decided to send some
                        of<br/> their respectable members in order to contribute<br/> their
                            influence to induce the hostile Indians to<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_194" n="194"></pb> a peace,</said>
                    but I do not find from the Journal of<br/> the Commissioners that any Friends
                    attended.</p>
<p>The negotiation failed. The Indians insisted<br/> upon the removal of the white
                    settlements and<br/> Forts from the country northwest of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>,<br/> which the Commissioners refused to accede
                    to,<br/> maintaining the claims of the United States to<br/> certain portions of
                    the country under treaties<br/> from other tribes who were believed
                    competent<br/> to make title to it.</p>
<p>By the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a> the Indians
                    ce-<br/>ded to the United States a tract of country com-<br/>prising about
                    twenty five thousand square miles,<br/> or sixteen million acres, some of which
                    however<br/> was included in previous grants from other tribes.<br/> They also
                    ceded sixteen smaller tracts as sites<br/> for Forts, trading stations, &amp;c.
                    They received<br/> in consideration of the cession, twenty thousand<br/> dollars
                    in goods, and permanent annuities amount-<br/>ing to eleven thousand dollars;
                    $9,500 in goods<br/> delivered, the cost of delivery and distribution<br/> being
                    $1,500. The annuities, at 5 percent re-<br/>presents a capital of $220,000; thus
                    the entire<br/> payment would be $240,000 for 16,000,000<br/> acres of land, or
                    one cent and a half per acre.</p>
<p>The annuities of several of the tribes com-<br/>menced at once, and are still
                    paid regularly<br/> under the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, and they re-<br/>ceive additional annuities under
                    other treaties.<br/> Indeed all the tribes who were parties to the<br/> treaty
                    of <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, received regular
                    annuities<br/><pb facs="SW_GH1804_195" n="195"></pb> from the Government, but I have not been
                    able<br/> to trace in them the specific amounts granted by<br/> that treaty. </p>
