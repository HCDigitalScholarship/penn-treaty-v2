<p>In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A
                    (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American Literature”) transcribed
                    a number of journals, both published and in manuscript form, which document the
                    interaction of Quakers and Native Americans. In 2014 a decision was made to
                    encode these and other journals as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library.</p>

<p> In the second volume of Friends' Miscellany, was published, <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>'s Account of a Journey to attend
                    this Treaty, with preli<br/>minary remarks and a brief history of the
                    circumstances which led to<br/> this measure. The following Journal, while it
                    corroborates <a href="/people/jlindl">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlindl"></persname></a>'s account,
                    presents a view of divers interesting incidents<br/> and occurrences, not noted
                    in that narrative. <a href="/people/jmooor3">Joseph Moore<persname key="jmooor3"></persname></a> was a<br/>
                    valuable friend and minister belonging to Kingwood monthly meet-<br/>ing, New

<dateline>On the <date when="1793-04-01">17th of 4th mo. 1793</date>, <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p>I set out for Philadel-<br/>phia, and attended the <a href="/organizations/pymsufferings">meeting for sufferings<orgname key="pymsufferings"></orgname></a>, where<br/> were divers Friends who had
                    given up to attend the<br/> Indian treaty proposed to be held at <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, on<br/> the waters of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> — having previously obtained
                    <br/>certificates from our several monthly meetings for<br/> that purpose. The
                    commissioners appointed by go-<br/>vernment are,<a href="/people/genlinc">general

<p>In the afternoon set out in company with <pb n="290"></pb>
<br/>
<a href="/people/grand1">Beverly Randolph<persname key="grand1"></persname></a>,<a href="/people/jparr1">John

<a href="/people/habee1">Henry Cornplanter<persname key="habee1"></persname></a>, or Obeal — got that evening to<br/>
<a href="/places/norrist">Norristown <placename key="norrist"></placename></a>, where <a href="/people/cpic">colonel Pickering<persname key="cpic"></persname></a> met us. Next<br/> day we proceeded to
                        <a href="/places/readi">Reading<placename key="readi"></placename></a> — thence to <a href="/places/harrisb">Harris-burgh<placename key="harrisb"></placename></a> and over the <geogname key="broadm">Broad Mountain</geogname>, <a href="/places/mackin">Mackinoy<placename key="mackin"></placename></a>, and<br/>
<a href="/places/tuscar">Tuscarora<placename key="tuscar"></placename></a>, to <a href="/places/sunb">Sunbury<placename key="sunb"></placename></a> — thence crossed the <geogname key="susqueh">Susque-<br/>hanna</geogname> at <a href="/places/northu">Northumberland<placename key="northu"></placename></a>, a town standing in the<br/> point where the
                    east and west branches come toge-<br/>ther. Here, leaving the commissioners
                    behind, we,<br/> in company with <a href="/people/jhain2">Josiah

                    meeting of Friends.<br/> After which, went to <a href="/people/swall1">Samuel

<p> The forepart of this day, we passed<br/> a rapid stream, called the <geogname key="loyalso">Loyalsock</geogname> — and in the af-<br/>ternoon we crossed
                    another large stream, called <geogname key="lyc">Ly-<br/>coming</geogname>,
                    seven times — lodged at <a href="/people/jkyle1">James Kyle<persname key="jkyle1"></persname></a>'s.
                    Next<br/> day rode forty-three miles without any entertain-<br/>ment on the way,
                    except what we had with us. —<br/> Where we put up, there was no hay to be had
                    for<br/> our horses, so we fed them with oats, and tied them<br/> up for the
                    night— went to bed, or rather lay on the<br/> floor with our own blankets, in a
                    very small house;<br/> but rested well. In the morning, the weather was<br/>
                    fine and pleasant — rode to major <a href="/people/slind">Samuel
                        Lindley<persname key="slind"></persname></a>'s,<br/> crossed the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname> twice, and the <geogname key="cowni">Cownisky</geogname>;
                    then to<br/> the <a href="/places/ppost">Painted Post<placename key="ppost"></placename></a>, crossing the
                        <geogname key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogname> at <a href="/people/dfull">David Fuller<persname key="dfull"></persname></a>'s. On our way here, we swam our horses<br/>
                    over the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>, and went ourselves in a canoe.
                    The<br/> country from <a href="/places/northu">Northumberland<placename key="northu"></placename></a>to this
                    place, abounds<br/> with large streams of water, and abundance of flat<br/> land
                    on their banks, exceedingly rich. We observed<br/> in many places, old Indian
                    fields, with signs of the <br/>
<pb n="291"></pb> old corn hills. On each side of these creeks and flats,<br/> are
                    ridges of mountains. We have now travelled ac-<br/>cording to the several
                    distances from place to place,<br/> two hundred, and forty-seven miles. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-09">9th.</date><placename key="willi"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode about thirty miles, and a little be-<br/>fore night, got to an old Indian
                    cabin, with fire in<br/>the middle, where we lodged. We let our horses<br/>
                    browse awhile in the woods, then fed them with oats<br/> we had with us, and
                    tied them up for the night. —<br/> This cabin stands on the bank of the
                        <geogname key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogname> . The<br/> roads here are new, and
                    of course rough, which is<br/> trying to the poor horses that are rid hard all
                    day,<br/> and at night tied to a tree. Next day, rode thirty-<br/> six miles to
                        <a href="/places/willi">Williamsburgh<placename key="willi"></placename></a>. Some parts of the
                    road<br/> very rough. We passed over some of the steepest<br/> hills I ever saw
                    travelled. But the country is new<br/> — and I have no doubt in a few years, the
                    roads will<br/> be much improved, as there is abundance of excel-<br/>lent land
                    that is settling fast in some places. Stayed<br/> this night at captain
                        <a href="/people/cwilm">Charles Williamson<persname key="cwilm"></persname></a>'s, where we<br/> were
                    kindly entertained. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-11">11th.</date><placename key="willi"></placename></dateline>
<p> This morning the commissioners despatch-<br/>ed a messenger to <a href="/places/canan">Canandaigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a> for an interpreter;<br/> so we rested
                    here and were finely refreshed. Set<br/> out again next day, and rode to
                        <a href="/people/gberr">Gilbert Berry<persname key="gberr"></persname></a>'s, on<br/> the bank of the
                        <geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname>. Here we found<br/> about
                    fifty Indians collected, amongst whom were<br/> some of their chiefs; <a href="/people/farme1">Farmer's Brother<persname key="farme1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/redja1">Red
                        Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/litbi1">Little Billy<persname key="litbi1"></persname></a>, and others, to all of whom a
                    dinner<br/> was given by the commissioners. They expressed<br/> their gladness
                    in seeing us, and we also in seeing<br/> them. In the evening we had some
                    weighty con-<br/>versation together, wherein the commissioners im-<br/>parted a
                    little of their business concerning the treaty; <br/>
<pb n="292"></pb> which appeared to give general satisfaction. After<br/> which, the
                    Indians gave our friend <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> a<br/>
                    new name, which they in their language call <foreign xml:lang="iro">Sutte-<br/>kutte</foreign>, and signifies plain or level. This name
                    was<br/> given by <a href="/people/farme1">Farmer's Brother<persname key="farme1"></persname></a>, at which
                    there was a<br/> small shout, in their way, and they would have given<br/> us a
                    song on the occasion; but understanding we were<br/> a plain people, not
                    accustomed to singing, it was<br/> omitted, and nothing further followed than a
                    little<br/> pleasantry. Near ten o'clock we all retired and <br/> rested
                    bravely. </p>
<p> In the morning the Indians showed no inclination<br/> to depart while the
                    commissioners were here.<a href="/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a> , at
                    the close of one of his speeches last even-<br/>ing, signified, that when he was
                    in Philadelphia, the<br/> white people had proposed a method for them to<br/>
                    turn buffaloes into cows, deer into sheep, and bears<br/> into hogs; he thought
                    it now a fit time for the com-<br/>missioners to show them a piece of their
                    skill; as<br/> they were now on their way to <a href="/places/canan">Canandaigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a> for<br/> some clothing, &amp;c, and that a good
                    buffalo would be<br/> very agreeable for provision on the way. The
                    com-<br/>missioners used some endeavours to obtain a fat cow;<br/> but as there
                    was none to be had here, they gave them<br/> a quantity of salt beef, pork, and
                    corn, at which they<br/> appeared satisfied. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-14">14th</date>.<placename key="buffc1"></placename></dateline>
<p> We prepared to move forward; divers other<br/> people fell in company with us
                    from <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>
<br/>and other places, who were going into <a href="/places/canad">Upper
                        Cana-da<placename key="canad"></placename></a>. We swam our horses over the <geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname><br/> with some difficulty, and we, with our
                    baggage,<br/> crossed in a canoe. In the evening we put up in the<br/> woods by
                    the side of <geogname key="tonnec">Tonnewanta creek</geogname>, where we<br/>
                    sheltered for the night with a good fire, and tied up <br/>
<pb n="293"></pb> our horses as before. The following day we travel-<br/>led hard,
                    being very desirous to reach some house<br/> to lodge in. According to the
                    account given us, we<br/> rode about fifty miles, and truly we thought them<br/>
                    long enough. Arrived at <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogname> about
                    sun<br/> set, and put up at <a href="/people/winney">landlord Winney<persname key="winney"></persname></a>'s;
                    most of us<br/> lodged on the floor and slept well; also, had plenty<br/> of
                    grass for the horses. The country we have pass-<br/>ed through the last two
                    days, is Indian lands, and<br/> one continued wilderness. Much of the land
                    ap-<br/>pears very good, with a variety of timber, such as<br/> oak, hickory,
                    sugar maple, elm, ash, beech, linn,<br/> pine, cherry, butternut, &amp;c. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-16">16th</date>. <placename key="nav"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode about three miles to the ferry, nearly<br/> opposite <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, most of the way along the beach<br/> of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>. Here we crossed over the outlet of<br/>
                    the lake, a large and strong current, landed in the<br/>
<a href="/places/brit">British dominions<placename key="brit"></placename></a>, and rode down the banks of
                    the<br/> river to <a href="/people/cwils">Charles Willson<persname key="cwils"></persname></a>'s near the
                        <geogname key="niagf">great falls</geogname>. The<br/> whole distance to
                    this place is four hundred and<br/> twenty-seven miles. In the evening, walked
                    to<br/> the brow of the bank to view the mighty cataract.<br/> Next morning went
                    again, descended a very steep<br/> hill and walked to the rock over which the
                    water<br/>falls, which appears tremendous indeed. There are<br/> rapids above
                    the cataract that fall, it is said, fifty feet<br/> (and it looks likely to be
                    so) within the distance of<br/> little more than half a mile. After satisfying
                    our<br/> curiosity here, the commissioners went on to <a href="/people/gsim">gover-nor Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>'s, at <a href="/places/nav">Navy
                        Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>, sixteen miles. This is<br/> nearly opposite the <a href="/places/niafo">garrison<placename key="niafo"></placename></a>, which stands on a point<br/> of land in
                    the United States. <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>,<a href="/people/jelli1"> John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>, and myself, went about two miles
                    to our <br/>
<pb n="294"></pb> friend <a href="/people/wlund1">William Lundy's<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>, where we
                    were kindly en-<br/>tertained, and spent most of the next day. </p>

<p> Being first of the week, and having appoint-<br/>ed a meeting to be held here at
                    the eleventh hour;<br/> about the time there attended a pretty large
                    collection<br/> of people, more than the house could contain. We<br/> thought it
                    a favoured opportunity. After dinner we<br/> had a solid opportunity with the
                    family and divers<br/> friends who had stayed with us. Then went about six<br/>
                    miles to our friend <a href="/people/jhill1">John Hill's<persname key="jhill1"></persname></a>, who, with his
                    wife,<br/> had been at the meeting. Here we were kindly en-<br/>tertained and
                    lodged. In the morning, had a solid<br/> opportunity with the family, and set
                    out for <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>, a messenger having been
                    sent to invite us to<br/> dine with the governor. He appears to be a plain<br/>
                    man, and remarkably easy of access. At table we<br/> had the company of the
                    commissioners, <a href="/people/cbutl1">colonel But-ler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/mlit">majors Little<persname key="mlit"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/hal">Hales<persname key="hal"></persname></a>,
                    &amp;c. The governor, when<br/> we were walking in his garden, said our coming
                    for-<br/>ward at this time, did our society great honour. To-<br/>ward evening
                    we rode up the lake about two miles<br/> to <a href="/people/peacock">landlord
                        Peacock<persname key="peacock"></persname></a>'s, and lodged. </p>

<p> We went up the lake twelve miles to <a href="/people/bpaul">Ben-jamin
                        Paulin<persname key="bpaul"></persname></a>'s and his brother <a href="/people/jpaul">Jesse<persname key="jpaul"></persname></a>'s
                    — our friend,<br/>
<a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, having a letter from their
                    connexions in<br/> Philadelphia. Here we were kindly entertained. In<br/> the
                    woods we came through, we observed the great-<br/>est quantity of pigeons, I
                    think I ever saw; they<br/> were flying up the lake, being chiefly young
                    ones,<br/> and very fat. The people take abundance of them<br/> with clubs,
                    poles, &amp;c. </p>

<p> The weather has been warm and dry since<br/> the time of our arrival in this
                    country. I continue<br/> very poorly, but went three miles to our friend
                        <a href="/people/jtayl2">John
<persname key="jtayl2"></persname></a> though hardly able to travel. Here
                    we<br/> were kindly treated and lodged. I believe many<br/> were made glad in
                    seeing their friends come amongst<br/> them, for whom in their wilderness
                    situation, we<br/> often felt near sympathy. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-23">23d</date>. <placename key="short"></placename></dateline>
<p> I felt much better in health, and understand-<br/>ing divers Friends live at a
                    place called the <geogname key="short">Short<br/> Hills</geogname>, about twelve
                    miles off, we concluded to go<br/> there. On the way we dined at <a href="/people/trice1">Thomas Rice<persname key="trice1"></persname></a>'s, and<br/> thence proceeded to
                        <a href="/people/jgilh1">Joshua Gillam<persname key="jgilh1"></persname></a>'s. We passed<br/> through
                    some land where we saw the effects of a<br/> hurricane that was on the 1st of
                    the 7th month last,<br/> and truly I may say, I never saw so great
                    destruc-<br/>tion of timber. For about two miles in width, and<br/> said to be
                    many miles in length, there was scarce a<br/> single tree left that was not torn
                    up by the roots, or<br/> broken off. This tract, as far as we have passed
                    over,<br/> appears excellent land, with a variety of good tim-<br/>ber — white
                    and black oak, hickory, chestnut, poplar,<br/> white pine, walnut, cherry,
                    &amp;c. We, finding a few<br/> Friends settled in this neighborhood, concluded
                    to<br/> stay amongst them over first-day, and have a meet-<br/>ing with them. In
                    the interval, we visited at <a href="/people/jcraw1">James
                        Crawford<persname key="jcraw1"></persname></a>'s, <a href="/people/esnig1">Enoch Scrigley<persname key="esnig1"></persname></a>'s,
                    and <a href="/people/jdarl1">John Dorlin<persname key="jdarl1"></persname></a>g's,<br/> where the meeting is
                    proposed to be held. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-26">26th</date>. <placename key="nav"></placename></dateline>
<p> We had a considerable gathering of people<br/> that behaved orderly, among whom
                    we had a satis-<br/>factory opportunity. In the afternoon, set out on<br/> our
                    way to <a href="/places/nav">Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a> , and lodged at <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>'s. Having heard of the arrival
                    of the other<br/> Friends that came by the way of <a href="/places/alban'">Albany<placename key="alban'"></placename></a>, we rose<br/> early next morning, and went to our friend
                        <a href="/people/bhill1">Benja-min Hill<persname key="bhill1"></persname></a>'s, where we took
                    breakfast — then rode to<br/> the landing, and thence to <a href="/places/nav">
                        Navy Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>. Spent a little <br/><pb n="296"></pb> time at the
                    governor's, and went back to the landing,<br/> where we met with <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>,<br/> and <a href="/people/whart">William
                        Hartshorne<persname key="whart"></persname></a>, who had come on by wa-<br/>ter. Our stores were
                    landed here, and we all dined<br/> at <a href="/people/csmith">captain
                        Smith<persname key="csmith"></persname></a>'s, at the mess house. In the after-<br/>noon we set up our
                    tents on the hill, and lodged all<br/> together. This seemed very pleasant,
                    being all in<br/> health, and they having had a favourable passage from<br/> New
                    York to this place, and very agreeable compa-<br/>ny with <a href="/people/genlinc">general Lincoln<persname key="genlinc"></persname></a>, in their covered <term>batteaux
                    </term>,<br/> two of which they propose taking up to <geogname key="lakee">Lake

<p> Having had a good night's rest in our tents,<br/> were in the morning all
                    bravely. When we shall<br/> move forward from this place appears at present
                    un-<br/>certain, as the commissioners sent off an express yes-<br/>terday to
                        <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> on some important
                    occasion,<br/> and expect to wait his return. Young <a href="/people/habee1">Cornplanter<persname key="habee1"></persname></a><br/> went some days ago to his father's, about one
                    hun-<br/>dred and fifty miles from this place. The Indians,<br/> we understand,
                    are gathering from many parts to the<br/> place appointed. Some of the <a href="/organizations/Mohawk">Mohawks<orgname key="Mohawk"></orgname></a> are now<br/> here. We shortly expect a number
                    of the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Na-tions<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>. <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a> being desirous to see <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>, we two rode there, spent the
                    afternoon, and<br/> lodged. The weather cool and cloudy, with east-<br/>erly
                    winds. The next day was rainy. We are now<br/> within about three miles of the
                    great cataract — the<br/> noise of which is much like the roaring of the sea
                    in<br/> time of storm. The people gave us a particular ac-<br/>count of their
                    distressed situation, about four years<br/> ago, for want of bread, and their
                    loss of cattle and<br/> horses; which was truly alarming ; but through the<br/>
                    goodness of kind Providence, they have now plenty <br/><pb n="297"></pb> of bread
                    and other necessaries; and plenty of good<br/> sugar which they make from the
                    maple tree. </p>

<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> came up from our camp at the<br/>
                    landing, and we, with <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a> and
                        <a href="/people/bhill1">Benjamin Hill<persname key="bhill1"></persname></a>, went to the <geogname key="niagf">Falls,</geogname> where <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>
                    had not been,<br/> and viewed them in a different direction from what<br/> we
                    had done before. In this as well as many other<br/> things, the mighty works of
                    Providence are emi-<br/>nently displayed, being far beyond the power of
                    hu-<br/>man art to form. Some of our company descended<br/> the mighty hill, by
                    the clefts of rocks and the help<br/> of Indian ladders, to the water below,
                    supposed one<br/> hundred and ten feet. Here they saw divers curi-<br/>osities,
                    and brought up some memorials of stone,<br/> bones, &amp;c. We then returned to
                    our camp, and I<br/> lodged at <a href="/people/bcanb1">Benjamin

<p> We had at our little camp, the company of<br/>
<a href="/people/haupa1">captain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a> and several other Indians,
                    that fed<br/> on our provisions — and a white man, lately from<br/>
<a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, informed that the Indians from the
                    south-<br/>ward were coming on. </p>

<p> The weather wet and little business<br/> to be done — though the article
                    provision meets with<br/> a large consumption — we being all in pretty good<br/>
                    health, and for the most part a number of Indians and<br/> others at our camp.
                    The commissioners are most of<br/> the time at <a href="/places/nav">Navy
                        Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a> with <a href="/people/gsim">governor Simcoe.<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>
                    We<br/> expect to move forward in a day or two, towards<br/>
<a href="/places/ferie"> Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, to take passage in a vessel for
                        <a href="/places/detro">Detriot<placename key="detro"></placename></a> —<br/> the commissioners not
                    likely to go from this under<br/> a week or ten days. We endeavour to fill up
                    our<br/> time in seeing our friends. This afternoon <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Par-rish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>,
                    crossed the river and went to <br/><pb n="298"></pb> an Indian settlement of about

<p> and first of the week, we held a meeting about <br/>four miles from the landing,
                    in a large barn, of which<br/> previous notice had been given. The collection
                    was<br/> large, and proved a solid opportunity. I hope it<br/> tended to the
                    advancement of our religious testimo-<br/>ny. Divers Friends came many miles to
                    attend it.<br/> After which, <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery
                    <persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>and <a href="/people/whart"> William Harts-horne<persname key="whart"></persname></a>
                    returned to our camp, in order to send for-<br/>ward our baggage to-morrow to
                    the upper landing<br/> above the Falls. <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob

                    myself, went to <a href="/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>'s and<br/>
                    dined — thence to <a href="/people/wlund1">William Lundy<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>'s and lodged.
                        <a href="/people/eburc1">Es-quire Burch<persname key="eburc1"></persname></a> was at meeting, and
                    kept company with<br/> us thus far. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-06-03">3d</date>.<placename key="ferie" type="unattested"></placename></dateline>
<p> Went on to <a href="/people/eburc1"> esquire Burch <persname key="eburc1"></persname></a>'s, where we
                    dined.<br/> Bought three barrels of flour and sent forward to<br/>
<a href="/organizations/chip">Chipaway<orgname key="chip"></orgname></a>, to be carried on with the rest of
                    our<br/> baggage, to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>.<a href="/people/jparr1"> John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jelli1">John
                        Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a><br/>, and myself, rode up the river about seven miles
                    and<br/> lodged at our friend <a href="/people/richa">Richardsun's<persname key="richa"></persname></a>.
                    Next morning<br/> went to <a href="/people/bwill1">Benjamin Willson<persname key="bwill1"></persname></a>'s,
                    whose wife is a near<br/> relation of mine. <a href="/people/bwill1">Benjamin<persname key="bwill1"></persname></a> went with us six miles<br/> to the Fort. Here are the
                    king's stores, and a har-<br/>bour for shipping — several topsail vessels were
                    then<br/> lying here. We went on board the Dunmore, <a href="/people/cford1">cap-tain Ford<persname key="cford1"></persname></a>, bound to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. The cabin passengers<br/> besides ourselves were
                        <a href="/people/rinn1"> Robert Inne<persname key="rinn1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/Newm">Newman<persname key="Newm"></persname></a><br/> and servant,<a href="/people/rhill1"> Richard Hillery

                        <a href="/people/wwils1">William Willson<persname key="wwils1"></persname></a>. These, with the
                    sailors and marines(be<br/>ing a king's ship) and about sixty Indians of
                    four<br/> different tribes bound to the treaty, made our whole<br/>
<pb n="299"></pb> crew about ninety. We left our horses in the care<br/> of
                        <a href="/people/bwill1">Benjamin Willson<persname key="bwill1"></persname></a> — next day set sail and
                    steered<br/> up the lake. We had fine pleasant weather until the<br/> 8th, when
                    being near the islands towards the head <br/>of the lake, and dark night coming
                    on us, we stood<br/> off and on till morning — had several squalls of rain,<br/>
                    and short blasts of high wind, with thunder and<br/> lightning — which was
                    somewhat alarming, as our<br/> ship had on board a large quantity of powder.
                    But<br/> through the goodness of kind Providence we were<br/> preserved from
                    damage. </p>

<p> and first of the week; — fine pleasant morning<br/> with light airs of wind. The
                    islands now appeared<br/> in sight. This day we had a small meeting in the<br/>
                    cabin with our fellow passengers and two Indian<br/> chiefs. In the evening
                    entered the mouth of <geogname key="detro"> Detriot<br/> river</geogname>, and
                    anchored till morning; when we ran up<br/> the beautiful river a northerly
                    course, with a fair<br/> wind to <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>.
                    This is a small garrison town, with<br/> a variety of inhabitants. Here is much
                    of the sound<br/> of drums and trumpets, but not much religion. The<br/> people
                    here, as well as those on board our ship, were<br/> very respectful to us — and
                    there was great harmony<br/> amongst ourselves. Thanks be to kind
                    Providence<br/> for all his unmerited favours. Here we landed our<br/> small
                    baggage, and took lodgings at <a href="/people/mdols">Matthew
                        Dol-son's<persname key="mdols"></persname></a> for the present. </p>

<p> Found our accommodations comfortable and<br/> easy. We visited the
                        commandant,<a href="/people/cengl1">colonel Eng-land<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, and
                    showed him our passport from <a href="/people/gsim">governor
                        Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>, at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, and are
                    now waiting the com-<br/>missioners coming forward, which we hope may be<br/>
                    soon. From the present complexion of things, it<br/> looks likely to be some
                    time before the treaty com-<br/>
<pb n="300"></pb>mences; so that we find patience very necessary to<br/> be
                    exercised. We hear many sentiments expressed,<br/> some favourable and some
                    otherwise. Hope our<br/> minds may not be diverted by either from that
                    hum-<br/>ble dependence on the omnipotent Arm of power,<br/> under whose banner,
                    I trust, we have enlisted in the<br/> righteous cause of peace-makers. </p>

<p> Took a walk down the bank of the river,<br/> about three miles to a fine spring,
                    of which there<br/> are few hereabouts. The inhabitants mostly use the<br/>
                    river water, which is said to be very wholesome.<br/> The banks of this river
                    for many miles above and<br/> below the town, are very thickly settled,
                    mostly<br/> with French, who have fine orchards and meadows,<br/> and good wheat
                    growing. Their grain is mostly<br/> manufactured by wind-mills, of which there
                    are<br/> many in sight. The inhabitants of the town are as<br/> great a mixture,
                    I think, as I ever knew in any one<br/> place. English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch,
                    French, Ame-<br/>ricans from different states, with black and yellow,<br/> and
                    seldom clear of Indians of different tribes in the<br/> day time. These are all
                    turned out by nine o'clock<br/> at night, and the gates are shut — sentries are
                    placed<br/> constantly in various parts round tire town, which is <br/>enclosed
                    with high pickets. There is no place of wor-<br/>ship except one <a href="/organizations/catholic">Roman Catholic<orgname key="catholic"></orgname></a> chapel. There are<br/> large ships
                    employed on these waters, some of which<br/> are from one hundred to one hundred
                    and fifty tons<br/> burden; they sail up to <a href="/places/michi">Michillimackinac<placename key="michi"></placename></a>, several<br/> hundred miles from this place,
                    and return with<br/> abundance of peltry — the staple commodity of this<br/>
                    country. </p>

<p> Took passage in a small boat, bound up the<br/> river <geogname key="latr">Latrench</geogname>, on the east side of <geogname key="lstc">Lake St.
                        Clair,</geogname>
<br/> with a fair wind — passed through the lake, more than<br/> twenty miles
                    over, and went up the river about fif-<br/>teen miles, to <a href="/people/idols">Isaac Dolson<persname key="idols"></persname></a>'s, where we lodged. —<br/> Next day, with some
                    Indians in a canoe, proceed-<br/>ed up the river about twenty miles, to
                        <a href="/people/edwa1">Edward Watson<persname key="edwa1"></persname></a>'s, son of <a href="/people/twat1">Thomas<persname key="twat1"></persname></a>, of New York<br/>, an intimate<br/>
                    acquaintance. The respect I felt for him and his<br/> connections induced me to
                    take this tour to see him,<br/> and know how he fared here. He and his wife
                    re-<br/>ceived me kindly. They are connected with the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravian brethren<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a>, and were very civil to me.
                        <a href="/people/jheck1">John Heckewelder<persname key="jheck1"></persname></a>, Indian interpreter
                    and Moravian <br/>minister, was passenger with me as far as <a href="/people/jdols1">Dolson<persname key="jdols1"></persname></a>'s,<br/> where he took horse and went up the
                    river to visit<br/> his brethren at a settlement of that people. This<br/>
                    appears to be a beautiful new country, just settling;<br/> fine wheat, corn,
                    peas, &amp;c. now growing, and grass<br/> in abundance; — the timber, white and
                    black oak,<br/> cherry, hickory, black and white walnut, ash, linn,<br/> poplar,
                    &amp;c. I am informed it continues in that way<br/> for one hundred and fifty
                    miles up this river — the<br/> the general course of which runs about east from
                    its<br/> mouth, and the farther up, it is said, the better the<br/> land. The
                    inhabitants here appear to want as much<br/> cultivation as the lands they live
                    on. May the Lord's<br/> power so reach their hearts, as to bring them into<br/>
                    subjection to his Divine will. </p>

<p> Went early into the town — found all my<br/> dear friends well; they gave me an
                    account of two<br/> public meetings held by them; one with the inhabi-<br/>tants
                    of the town and soldiers, and a number of the<br/> officers, in the forenoon;

                    time of <br/> the opening of the treaty, and hear many frightful <br/> stories
                    about the conduct of the Indians; but we en-<br/>deavour to keep our minds
                    quiet, trusting in the<br/> arm of divine power for preservation, and
                    believing<br/> we are engaged in the righteous cause of promoting<br/> peace on

                    of our company, to wit, Friends, went down the<br/> river in a small boat, about

<a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, who mostly called us <foreign xml:id="undetermined">Shemucteman</foreign>, or<br/> long knives, the term

                    what<br/> we were, they signified they had heard of our being<br/> come, and
                    were glad. This day, we were visited<br/> by several that had just come to town.
                    We observ-<br/>ed the generality of all the tribes had a remarkable<br/> thirst

                    who behaved quietly. The meeting held about two<br/> hours and a half, and I

<a href="/organizations/ojibwe"> Chipaway nation<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>; one of whom, called a chief,

<p> The Indians are every day here, on their<br/> way to the treaty. Twenty-eight
                    are just arrived<br/> from <a href="/places/michi">Michillimackinac<placename key="michi"></placename></a>,
                    some of whom I saw this<br/> morning; they were well dressed, curiously
                    painted,<br/> and decorated with wampum, and ear and nose bobs;<br/> all young,
                    and the handsomest I think I have as<br/> yet seen. They appeared good humoured
                    and plea-<br/>sant, <br/>
<pb n="305"></pb> having, as I was informed, brought no arms or<br/> warlike
                    instruments with them, except their bows<br/> and arrows, with flutes for music,
                    of their own<br/> making, which appeared simple, but pleasing to<br/>
                    themselves. Some of the British officers asked<br/> them to play, which they
                    readily did, by putting<br/> the instrument to the mouth, and sometimes to
                    the<br/> nose; as handily to the one as the other.</p>
<p> This evening had the company of <a href="/people/cdrak1">capt. John

                    in a sloop of se-<br/>venty or eighty tons burthen. He gave us some<br/> account
                    of the north-west fur trade, and the man-<br/>ner of its being carried on by the
                    companies con-<br/>cerned, who employ many hundred men, that stay<br/> many
                    years in the country, travelling and trading<br/> with the northern Indians for
                    peltry; an abundance<br/> of which, of the richest kind, is brought from
                    the<br/> high northern latitudes, which nets the companies<br/> very large
                    profit. But among what people, or in<br/> what part of the world, except the
                        <a href="/organizations/lowcan">Canadian French<orgname key="lowcan"></orgname></a>,<br/> could persons be found
                    for their purpose, I know<br/> not. They are allowed a very small portion
                    of<br/> provisions from this to the <a href="/places/grandp">Grand
                        Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>, at the<br/> head of <geogname key="lakes">Lake
                        Superior</geogname>, which is about eight hun-<br/>dred miles; there they
                    are allowed about one bushel<br/> (forty-two quarts French measure) of Indian
                    corn<br/> per man, for a year, and a little fat, which they<br/> may use at
                    their own discretion. The corn is pre-<br/>pared in a curious manner at
                        <a href="/places/detro"> Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, being first<br/> boiled in
                    strong lye, which takes off the outside<br/> hull; afterwards it is spread out
                    and dried, then<br/> packed up for use. With this they set out, and re-<br/>
                    turn not until the end of the year, when a fresh <br/>
<pb n="306"></pb> supply of goods is taken up with canoes, &amp;c. by<br/> many
                    hundred men to the <a href="/places/grandp">Portage<placename key="grandp"></placename></a>, where they
                    ex-<br/>change commodities to a very great amount. Thus<br/> goes on the trade
                    from year to year. The men in<br/> the north live principally on fish, and the
                    flesh of<br/> beasts of divers kinds, without bread or salt, and<br/> when they
                    return appear as robust and healthy, and<br/> even more so than those who live
                    on the greatest<br/> delicacies. The principal fish in <geogname key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogname> are<br/> the white fish and salmon trout, which
                    are fine<br/> and delicate: we have eat of them, brought fresh from<br/> the
                    lake to this place in six days. </p>
<p> We understand one <a href="/people/mkenz1">M'Kenzie<persname key="mkenz1"></persname></a> is now out
                    with<br/> ten men, exploring the <a href="/places/northw"> North-west
                        Territory<placename key="northw"></placename></a> : he<br/> once attempted it before; was out more than
                    a year,<br/> and discovered large frozen waters in the north, but,<br/> whether
                    lakes or ocean, he knew not — supposed the<br/> latter, the water being salt. </p>
<p>
<a href="/people/cdrak1">Captain Drake<persname key="cdrak1"></persname></a>, by his own account, had been
                    se-<br/>veral voyages to <a href="/places/afri">Africa<placename key="afri"></placename></a>, in the horrid
                    business of <br/>fetching slaves, which he now very much condemns.<br/> He told
                    us many curious tales; — and is certainly<br/> a very temperate man with respect
                    to drink, taking<br/> nothing but water — a rare instance in a seafaring<br/>
                    man. Happy would it be for many thousands in<br/> the world, were his example
                    followed in that re-<br/>spect; families would be preserved from ruin and<br/>
                    distress, morality increase, the poor Indians be<br/> saved from many acts of
                    violence, and the end of<br/> our creation be more fully answered by
                    honouring<br/> God, our Creator. </p>

<p> We are frequently visited by the officers of<br/> this place, both civil and
                    military, who appear<br/> friendly, and treat us with much respect, often <br/>
<pb n="307"></pb> wishing us success in our laudable undertaking; as-<br/>suring us,
                    that nothing should be wanting that lay<br/> in their power, to render us happy
                    and comfortable.<br/> The commandant said, that if he apprehended dan-<br/>ger
                    at any time, he should lay his commands on us<br/> not to depart the place. But,
                    although we sought<br/> not the protection of military power, we were not<br/>
                    insensible of his great good will towards us, which<br/> we were not wanting to
                    acknowledge. </p>
<p> Visits from the Indians are almost every day re-<br/>peated, by different tribes
                    constantly coming in,<br/>, this being the thoroughfare for all the northern
                    In-<br/>dians. It would be difficult to describe the various<br/> appearances
                    they make, and languages they speak.<br/> It is wonderful to find the vast
                    expense the <a href="/organizations/brit">British government<orgname key="brit"></orgname></a> is at with
                    this people. <a href="/people/gsim1">Governor Sim-coe<persname key="gsim1"></persname></a> said it cost
                    them thirty thousand pounds per an-<br/>num. Here are agents appointed, that are
                    daily<br/> giving out large quantities of provision, &amp;c. </p>

<p> This day had a visit from a <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> chief,<br/>
                    who appeared to have much concern respecting the<br/> approaching treaty, and
                    mentioned the remem-<br/>brance of some long and broad belts that were
                    given<br/> out in former treaties, intended to bind us by the<br/> hands and
                    arms, so that no small accident in future<br/> should be able to make a
                    separation; and, notwith-<br/>standing all that had happened, they (<a href="/organizations/wyandot">the Wyan-dots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>) felt some of the old affection
                    to remain, and he<br/> hoped we would find it so at the general council;<br/>
                    but could speak for none but themselves. We as-<br/>sured him we had the same
                    love and friendship for<br/> them and all others, as our forefathers had, and
                    that<br/> our principles had always restrained us from war;<br/> and when we
                    believed the government was disposed <br/>
<pb n="308"></pb> to make peace with them on principles of justice,<br/> we were
                    made willing to leave our homes and take<br/> this long journey to endeavour to
                    promote it, and<br/> to be present at the concluding of so good a work.<br/> He
                    said, he knew long ago, we did not fight, but<br/> were for peace, and that, as
                    we had come a long<br/> journey, preserved in health, it was evident the<br/>
                    Great Spirit was pleased with our coming, and he<br/> hoped some good would be
                    done, and that the<br/> Great Spirit would bring us home in health and<br/>
                    safety. </p>
<p> We had a visit also this morning from <a href="/people/Ab">Abram<persname key="Ab"></persname></a>,
                    an<br/> Indian chief, <a href="/people/katha">Katharine<persname key="katha"></persname></a> his wife, and
                    their daugh-<br/>ters, richly clad, with plates of silver, &amp;c. </p>
<p> The introduction of distilled spirits among the<br/> people appears to have been
                    their ruin. The frauds,<br/> in consequence of it, imposed upon them, taking
                    in<br/> the ravages and depredations of war made amongst<br/> themselves, with
                    multiplied murders and thefts,<br/> seems to have prevented their being a
                    wealthy peo-<br/>ple. The contrary with many is sorrowfully their <br/>
                    situation, I fear to our condemnation; yet the his-<br/>tory of Indian
                    barbarity, and breach of faith to<br/> white people, and to one another, which
                    we have<br/> heard related since we came here, would be shock-<br/>ing to
                    recite, and is almost at times ready to stagger<br/> the faith of their best
                    friends. One of the <a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravian missionaries<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a>
                    signified his sense, that if peace should<br/> be concluded, it would not last
                    long, until they were<br/> further chastised. <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> asked, by what<br/> means? Did he mean the sword? He was
                    answered,<br/> yes. This sentiment, from one of those who make<br/> profession
                    of the peaceable principles of the gospel,<br/> was really discouraging. </p>
<pb n="309"></pb>
<p> We often hear many frightful things suggested; as,<br/> that we shall be either
                    killed, or kept as hostages at<br/> the ensuing council. This, with the accounts
                    of the<br/> Indian warriors in time past, frequently passing with<br/> numbers
                    of scalps and their disconsolate prisoners,<br/> seemed dreadful; yet we are not
                    discouraged from<br/> pursuing our first prospect; believing he that put us<br/>
                    forth, will go before us, if we are not wanting on our<br/> part. </p>
<p> It must be said to the honour of British humani-<br/>ty, and in commendation of
                    this government of Up-<br/>per <a href="/places/canad">Canada<placename key="canad"></placename></a>, and
                    its truly respectable and generous<br/> officers, that they have interfered to
                    the relief of<br/> great numbers of persons, and obtained their redemp-<br/>tion
                    at a great price; divers of whom that we met<br/> with appeared as the outcasts
                    of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> ; some of<br/> them, as <a href="/people/cengl1">colonel England"<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a> and other officers told us,<br/>
                    hardly had manners or gratitude to acknowledge<br/> the kindness, though in some
                    instances it cost one<br/> hundred pounds. But in the case of a real
                    Ameri-<br/>can, they never grudged it. </p>

<p> First of the week. This morning we were<br/> visited by a principal man of the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, called<br/> the <a href="/people/bchie1">Blind Chief<persname key="bchie1"></persname></a>, with his nephew, grand, and great<br/>
                    grandson; with whom we had some friendly con-<br/>versation. He told us eight of
                    their principal men<br/> were gone on to the council. We held meetings<br/> fore
                    and afternoon in the king's sail loft, to a good<br/> degree of satisfaction;
                    being largely attended by the<br/> citizens, officers, and soldiers, who behaved
                    quietly. </p>

<p> Took breakfast with <a href="/people/celli1"> captain Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>,<br/>
                    Indian commissioner. After which, went to the bu-<br/>rial of <a href="/people/ishon">Isidore Shone<persname key="ishon"></persname></a> at the Roman chapel. He was<br/> an old
                    Indian interpreter, supposed to have shorten-</p>
<p>
<pb n="310"></pb> ed his days by the immoderate use of strong drink.<br/> On this
                    occasion there was a good deal of form and<br/> ceremony, in their way. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-07-02">2d</date>. <placename key="detro"></placename></dateline>
<p> Yesterday arrived the ship Ottoway,<a href="/people/ccow"> captain
                        Cowan<persname key="ccow"></persname></a> , from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>. He
                    brought about eighty<br/> Indians — more than sixty were landed at <geogname key="miamr1">Mia-<br/>mi rapids</geogname>, with <a href="/people/cbutl1">colonel Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a>; eighteen of the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Onei-das<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> were on board here. It was said <a href="/people/cbutl1">Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a> was<br/> fearful they might be hurt by some
                    other Indians<br/> that were there, on account of some dislike they had<br/> to
                    one of their chiefs, who had given his interest in<br/> favour of the Americans,
                    in such a manner as to cre-<br/>ate jealousies amongst them. They,
                    notwithstand-<br/>ing apprehend themselves quite safe in the British<br/> lines,
                    where the tribes of all the nations from east,<br/> west, north, and south, are
                    daily supplied with pro-<br/>visions, &amp;c. And we hear nothing but wishes for
                    <br/> peace among the people every where.</p>
<p> This day we crossed the river in our landlord's<br/> boat, with himself, wife,
                    &amp;c. to his farm, where we<br/> regaled ourselves with fine ripe cherries,
                    and to-<br/>wards evening returned. The weather very warm,<br/> and for many
                    days past it has been very wet — but<br/> through divine favour we are all
                    preserved in good<br/> health. </p>
</div>

<p> We had a visit from <a href="/people/cengl1">colonel England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>, who
                    is<br/> constantly manifesting his regard in a very respect-<br/>ful manner. He
                    invited us to walk with him to his<br/> garden, and some of our company went. We
                    had<br/> also the company, at our lodgings, of a young <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shaw-neese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> chief, neatly and richly dressed in Indian<br/>
                    style; he stayed and dined with us, behaving with<br/> decency at table. But we
                    sometimes find great dif-<br/>ficulty in conversing with the Indians, in such
                    man-<br/>
<pb n="311"></pb> tier as we wish, on account of our interpreter's sen-<br/>timents
                    and prospects differing in some respects so<br/> widely from ours. </p>

<p> I was this day very poorly with a fever.—<br/> We were visited by fourteen of
                    the Indians that<br/> came in the Ottoway, with one Shawnee, who find-<br/>ing
                    our <a href="/people/wmcco1">doctor M'Caskey<persname key="wmcco1"></persname></a> had been with <a href="/people/gstcl1">St. Clair's army <persname key="gstcl1"></persname></a>at the time of the defeat,
                    told him, <said who="undetermined">you're<br/> my friend, though you ran away
                        from me once.</said>
</p>
<p> The commissioners are not yet arrived — we are<br/> still in suspense, and weary
                    of our long detention<br/> here — though we are well supplied with
                    provisions,<br/> &amp;c, and decently treated by our respectable land-<br/>lord
                    and landlady, as well as by the inhabitants in<br/> general, being often invited
                    to dine, &amp;c. In the even-<br/>ing I felt better and slept pretty well. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-07-05">5th</date>. <placename key="detro"></placename></dateline>
<p> We are much confined within the narrow<br/> limits of this small garrisoned
                    town, where, the<br/> streets being narrow, there is a want of air. A
                    fa-<br/>vourable opportunity presenting for a small tour on<br/> the water, we,
                    except <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/whart">William Hartshorne<persname key="whart"></persname></a>, went in a boat, provided by
                    our friend<br/>
<a href="/people/wbak1">William Baker<persname key="wbak1"></persname></a>, up the river about nine miles, to<br/>
<a href="/people/nwill1">Nathan Williams<persname key="nwill1"></persname></a>'s, where we were kindly
                    received,<br/> and dined. His place is situate at the entrance of<br/><geogname key="lakst"> Lake St. Clair</geogname>. While here, Nathan gave us an
                    ac-<br/>count, that in digging a cave for a root house, they<br/> found, about
                    six feet below the surface of the<br/> ground, large quantities of human bones,
                    that must<br/> have been for a long time there: and at another<br/> place on the
                    bank of the lake, it being washed away<br/> when the lake was high, there were
                    seen great<br/> numbers of the same kind, which they gathered up<br/> and
                    buried. The Indians said they must have been <br/>
<pb n="312"></pb> from people a great while ago that they knew no-<br/>thing of.
                    There is also near this lake, as we are in-<br/>formed, the appearance of old
                    forts, curiously made<br/> in ancient time, where pieces of earthenware are<br/>
                    often found, though large trees are now standing in<br/> the entrenchments, of
                    which the present Indians<br/> can give no account. We seem pretty generally
                    led<br/> to believe, from various circumstances, that the na-<br/>tives of this
                    land must be the descendants of old<br/> Jacob, and are of the scattered tribes,
                    who probably<br/> found their way here through <a href="/places/rus">Russia<placename key="rus"></placename></a>, and crossed<br/> over the narrow strait from <a href="/places/kams">Kamschatka<placename key="kams"></placename></a> to the west<br/> side of America. Be all
                    this as it may, we find them<br/> here in great numbers, at present a savage,
                    barbarous<br/> people when at war, and more particularly when in-<br/>toxicated
                    with strong drink, which has been intro-<br/>duced by the white people that
                    suppose themselves<br/> by far their superiors in religious and natural
                    under-<br/>standing. Happy would it have been for them and<br/> us, had we used
                    those superior talents, in mercy<br/> conferred upon us, more to the honour of
                    God, by<br/> following the example of our holy leader, Christ<br/> Jesus, who
                    said he <quote type="biblical">came not to destroy men's lives,<br/> but to save
                        them.</quote> May all Christendom more and<br/> more labour to experience a
                    renovation of heart and<br/> mind, submitting and conforming to the will of
                    hea-<br/>ven in all our conduct, consistent with the design of<br/> our
                    creation. Then might we have reason to hope<br/> for a blessing on our labours,
                    tending to stop the<br/> effusion of human blood, and the establishment of<br/>
                    Christ's kingdom on the mountain of love and holi-<br/>ness, where the lion and
                    the lamb might lie down<br/> together, there being nothing to make us
                    afraid.<br/> In the afternoon we re-embarked and returned to <br/>
<pb n="313"></pb> town. <a href="/people/wsave1">Wm. Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/whart">Wm. Hartshorne<persname key="whart"></persname></a> in our<br/> absence, were visited by a
                        <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> warrior, who<br/> announced to
                    them what had frequently been sug-<br/>gested to us before, by divers persons,
                    that if the<br/> commissioners did not immediately agree that all<br/> the land
                    west of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> should be given up by the<br/>
<a href="/places/usa">United States<placename key="usa"></placename></a>, or even hinted any thing to the
                    con-<br/>trary, by offering gifts or money as purchase, that<br/> not one of
                    them or their company would go off the<br/> ground alive; for their fathers, who
                    were all gone,<br/> had sold lands for knives, rum, &amp;c. till they were<br/>
                    now driven almost to the sun setting, where they<br/> were determined to make a
                    stand. He also pointed<br/> out very sensibly, the sad effects strong drink
                    had<br/> on their fathers in general. He then appeared per-<br/>fectly sober —
                    informing that four days before he left<br/> the <geogname key="miamr1">Miami
                        Rapids</geogname>, a deputation of two chiefs from<br/> a tribe, embarked
                    for <a href="/places/niagf">Niagara<placename key="niagf"></placename></a> to meet the commis-<br/>sioners,
                    and let them know the outlines of their con-<br/>clusions; and that if the white
                    people would settle<br/> to the banks of the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> on the east side, and agree<br/> that the river should be
                    the line, they would be glad,<br/> and take them by the hand and call them
                    brothers.<br/> But we apprehended no such power lay with the<br/> commissioners,
                    nor of its being the design of govern-<br/>ment, — the cloud looked dark and
                    heavy, and por-<br/>tended some dreadful scenes of desolation, except<br/> the
                    Lord should be pleased, in his abundant mercy,<br/> to interpose and spare this
                    wicked generation. </p>
<p> The aforesaid Indian, notwithstanding his sensi-<br/>bility and calmness, about
                    two hours after, returned<br/> much intoxicated with rum — behaved very
                    rudely,<br/> and drew a stroke with his tomahawk at one <a href="/people/sash1">Sylves-ter Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a>, an interpreter, who had long resided with <br/>
<pb n="314"></pb> the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, and now lives at
                        <a href="/places/fpitt1">Fort Pitt<placename key="fpitt1"></placename></a>. We sup-<br/>posed he had a
                    grudge against him for leaving them;<br/> but <a href="/people/sash1">Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a> prevented his doing him mischief. This,<br/> with other
                    insolent behavior to our landlord, caused<br/>
<a href="/people/cmuns1">captain Munsey<persname key="cmuns1"></persname></a>, who was there, to send for
                    some<br/> soldiers to turn him out of the garrison. These<br/> things look
                    gloomy, and tend to confirm us that no-<br/>thing short of wisdom from above
                    will do for us to<br/> lean to. </p>

<a href="/people/cbutl1">colonel Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>. The schooner<br/> Nancy also just arrived from

<p> First of the week. We held a meeting in<br/> the forenoon in the old sail loft:
                    it was to good satis-<br/>faction, being large and solid. In the afternoon
                    we<br/> went about five miles to the <geogname key="rushr">river
                        Rushe</geogname> — held a<br/> meeting with the inhabitants there and
                    several who<br/> went with us from the town. This also we thought<br/> was
                    comfortable and edifying. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-07-08">8th</date>. <placename key="detro"></placename></dateline>
<p> The weather hot and sultry — a heavy thun-<br/>der shower. We have no account
                    from the commis-<br/>sioners — hope they may come on with the Indian<br/>
                    deputies, if any thing is likely to be done. This is<br/> truly a trying scene
                    to us, to be kept in this expen-<br/>sive place so long in suspense; yet hope it
                    may not<br/> be altogether in vain. We think we have done the <br/>
<pb n="315"></pb> best we could in our present circumstances. Various<br/> reports
                    are daily coming in, with respect to the In-<br/>dians' disposition. We much
                    desire an opportunity<br/> with them in council, if it could be come at
                    proper-<br/>ly, whether the commissioners come or not. The<br/> opinion of many
                    is, there will be no general treaty.<br/> We received a letter from <a href="/people/amcke1">colonel M'Kee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a> in answer<br/> to one written him some
                    time ago; — says he will at-<br/>tend to our request, and give us every
                    intelligence<br/> he apprehends necessary; — and yesterday, one from<br/>
<a href="/people/haupa1">captain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>, at the <geogname key="miamr1">rapids of Miami</geogname>, request-<br/>ing some favours from
                    us, — which were granted.<br/> And truly we have many requests, that in our
                    pre-<br/>sent circumstances we are not able to comply with<br/> to the full.
                        <a href="/people/haupa1">Hendrick<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>s' account is more favourable<br/>
                    than some others we have had. He expresses a<br/> hope there will be a peace.
                    The general cry among<br/> the gentlemen and more knowing inhabitants of
                    this<br/> place is, <said who="undetermined">for God's sake, gentlemen, don't
                        venture<br/> yourselves to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>.</said> This we believe is from<br/> motives of entire
                    friendship and good will to us,<br/> and makes it at times very trying. And
                    though we<br/> have not felt any slavish fears — yet hope to move<br/>
                    cautiously, as wisdom, which is profitable to direct,<br/> may point out the
                    way. One of the Indians, a <a href="/organizations/delaware">De-laware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,
                    that brought <a href="/people/haupa1">captain Hendricks'<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a> letter,
                    says<br/> the western Indians keep their runners constantly<br/> out to watch
                    the motion of <a href="/people/gwayn1">general Wayne's<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a> army,<br/> from
                    whom they have some fearful apprehensions;<br/> which we hope are
                    groundless.</p>

<p> We had a visit from <a href="/people/bljac1">captain Blue Jacket<persname key="bljac1"></persname></a>,
                    a<br/> principal warrior among the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>. He
                    was in<br/> command at the defeat of St. Clair's army. He was<br/> richly
                    dressed. His appearance is lofty and mascu-<br/>
<pb n="316"></pb> line.He said he had heard of the Quakers — that<br/> they were a
                    harmless people that did not fight; and<br/> was glad now to see us. We had also
                    a visit from<br/> several others of the same tribe. One of a solid<br/>
                    countenance said, he heartily desired we might<br/> succeed in the great work of
                    peace; and appeared<br/> much pleased to see us. We have several capable<br/>
                    interpreters with us; but our sentiments being peace-<br/>ful, serious and
                    religious, are so opposite to theirs,<br/> that when they do interpret, it is
                    with such reluc-<br/>tance as puts it out of our power to relieve our<br/> minds
                    so fully as we could wish. This day received<br/> a letter from the <a href="/organizations/moraind">Moravian Indians<orgname key="moraind"></orgname></a> and their minis-<br/>ter,
                    expressing their grateful sense of Friends' kind-<br/>ness to them. </p>

                    Dunmore which was<br/> nearly ready to sail, and may be soon expected, if<br/>
                    not met with by the <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chipaway<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a>, and detained by

<p> First of the week. For some days I have<br/> felt rather dull and heavy — my
                    spirits low. I feel<br/> the importance of our embassy with much weight. —<br/>
                    The dark conversation frequently heard respecting<br/> war, is truly distressing
                    and discouraging. I am <br/>frequently led to recur back to the first
                    principles<br/> from whence the concern took its rise; and have, as<br/> yet, no
                    cause to doubt of its propriety, although<br/> many discouraging prospects are
                    frequently thrown<br/> in our way. We are comfortably preserved in unity<br/>
                    one with another in the main cause we are engaged<br/> in, hoping we shall not
                    be shaken from the right<br/> ground by the enemies of peace, — of which
                    there<br/> are many. </p>
<p> This day we had another meeting in the usual<br/> place, which was large and
                    solid. </p>

<p> Had an interview with <a href="/people/celli1">captain Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, who<br/>
                    had just returned from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, where the
                    Indians<br/> are collected; but nothing further has transpired.<br/> He appears
                    somewhat reserved; and our anxious<br/> state of suspense still continues. We
                    are apprehen-<br/>
<pb n="318"></pb> sive the Indian embassy to the commissioners may<br/> prevent the
                    proposed treaty. We wrote a letter to <br/><a href="/people/amcke1">colonel
                        McKee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a>, and an epistle to the Indians, to be<br/> forwarded the
                    first opportunity. </p>
<p> Here we observe a species of Indian slaves called<br/>
<a href="/organizations/pawnee">Pawnees<orgname key="pawnee"></orgname></a>, or Punins, — who are captives taken
                    by<br/> the <a href="/organizations/chippewa">Chipaways<orgname key="chippewa"></orgname></a> from the <a href="/organizations/sioux">Suse<orgname key="sioux"></orgname></a>, or <a href="/organizations/pawnee">Pawnee<orgname key="pawnee"></orgname></a>
                    nations.<br/> It is sorrowful to think that a nation so famed for<br/> liberty,
                    should hold them, and a number of the Afri-<br/>can race, in a state of bondage
                    during life. The go-<br/>vernment here, we understand, has made some essay<br/>
                    towards their enlargement, which, it is hoped, will,<br/> in time, amount to a
                    total abolition. </p>

                        El-liot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, deputy agent for Indian affairs, and again
                    ex-<br/>pressed our anxious desires to him, that a solid peace<br/> might take
                    place; we also queried if it would be<br/> proper for us, or any of our company,
                    to visit the In-<br/>dians in their present council at the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, where<br/> he was now about to return. He
                    told us, he thought<br/> in the present state of things, it would not be
                    eligi-<br/>ble to move that way. He gave us to understand,<br/> that the Indians
                    were generally acquainted with our<br/> being here, and our views towards them;
                    and hoped<br/> on the return of the Indian embassy, some way would<br/> open for
                    our relief. For the present, we concluded<br/> to forward the letters to and the
                    <a href="/people/amcke1">M'Kee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a> Indians, by<br/>
<a href="/people/celli1">Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, and as our having a personal interview
                    with<br/> the Indians appeared doubtful, we forwarded Friends'<br/> Address to
                    them, to be read by <a href="/people/amcke1">M'Kee<persname key="amcke1"></persname></a> in case we<br/>

                    as we hear hostilities<br/> between them and the whites have been renewed
                    to<br/> the southward. These accounts are alarming and<br/> discouraging. The
                    commissioners are not yet come.<br/> We wait as patiently as we can, until we
                    hear fur-<br/>ther from them. </p>

<p> This morning had an interview with <a href="/people/cwell2">cap-tain
                        Wellbank<persname key="cwell2"></persname></a>, who came with the detachment of<br/>
<a href="/organizations/cherokee">Cherokee<orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/creek">Creek<orgname key="creek"></orgname></a> Indians from the southern ter-<br/>ritory, he says, more
                    than a thousand miles, and<br/> that they were ninety days on their journey.
                    His<br/> principal business seemed to be with <a href="/people/cengl1">colonel
                        Eng-land<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a> , who gave immediate orders for the sloop
                    Feli-<br/>city to sail with him on board, to <a href="/places/ferie"> Fort
                        Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, on his<br/> way to <a href="/people/gsim">governor
                        Simcoe<persname key="gsim"></persname></a>. We suppose they have<br/> some matters of importance, as
                    colonel England<br/> a few days ago assured us the Felicity was detained<br/> on
                    purpose to take us to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, or <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>,<br/> as was most eligible, on the
                    shortest notice, which<br/>looked kind and friendly to our purpose. </p>

<p> The weather fair and pleasant, and through<br/> Divine favour, we are all in
                    health ; but are still in<br/> great suspense, with respect to the event of this
                    in-<br/>tended treaty, which every day looks more and<br/> more discouraging.
                    Yet we think we have been in<br/> the line of our duty in coming forward and
                    labour-<br/>ing thus far; and hope our being here may be of<br/> some use on
                    divers accounts. Some of our compa-<br/>
<pb n="320"></pb> ny walked yesterday to the spring about three miles<br/> below the
                    town, where they had a satisfactory op-<br/>portunity with some <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> that were en-<br/>camped there. They
                    seem jointly concerned with<br/> us for the accomplishment of peace. This day
                    we<br/> were all together in the arbour in the colonel's gar-<br/>den, looking
                    over some writings on Indian affairs.<br/> To this place we frequently resort,
                    as it is retired<br/> and pleasant — being indulged with this privilege by<br/>
                    invitation from the colonel soon after our arrival<br/> here. </p>

<p> The harbour is now clear of shipping. —<br/> We are anxiously waiting the
                    arrival of the Dun-<br/>more, by which we expect the commissioners, or to<br/>
                    hear from them, hoping our detention here will be<br/> shortly closed by our
                    going on to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, or re-<br/>turning to
                        <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a> on our way home: till
                    which<br/> we desire humbly to submit to the wise Disposer of<br/> events. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-07-21">21st</date>. <placename key="detro"></placename></dateline>
<p> First of the week. We held a meeting in<br/> the sail loft at the tenth hour,
                    which was a favour-<br/>ed time, it being large and solid. Soon after our
                    re-<br/>turn, we heard of the arrival of the Dunmore at the<br/> mouth of the
                    river, by a passenger who came in her,<br/> and that the commissioners are on
                    board, expecting<br/> to go forward soon to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>. In the afternoon<br/> we had another comfortable
                    meeting, crowned as<br/> we thought, with the Master's good presence. And<br/>
                    now it looks likely to be a parting one, — the peo-<br/>ple behaved with
                    remarkable quietness — manifest-<br/>ing much respect to us. I believe there are
                    a few<br/> tender-hearted ones in this place that will remember<br/> us, and I
                    hope we shall not forget them; — though it<br/> is sorrowful to behold the power
                    and influence that <br/>
<pb n="321"></pb> satan has too generally amongst the inhabitants of<br/> these
                    parts. <a href="/people/cgibs">Captain Gibbons<persname key="cgibs"></persname></a>, who came passenger<br/>
                    in the Dunmore, gave us the above intelligence re-<br/>specting the
                    commissioners, and further says, the<br/> Indian deputies and they held a very
                    friendly con-<br/>ference together at <a href="/places/nav">Navy
                    Hall<placename key="nav"></placename></a>, and things appeared<br/> in a favourable way respecting the
                    treaty. This ac-<br/>count is more pleasant than any we have had for<br/> many
                    days past. In this fluctuating state of things<br/> we find great need to keep
                    on the right bottom, so<br/> that we may not be shaken from that
                    foundation,<br/> and a humble confidence in the Divine power, which<br/>I trust
                    we felt in our embarkation. </p>

<a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jelli1">John

                    kind. We also had a short interview with<br/> the commandant, who has manifested
                    much respect<br/> to us during our long stay here, and now told us,<br/> that
                    nothing should be wanting that lay in his power<br/> to make our way easy. </p>

<p> We now began to prepare for leav-<br/>ing <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>. The commandant visited us at our quar-<br/>ters, and
                    informed us he proposed going with us in<br/> the Dunmore to see the
                    commissioners. It seemed<br/> very pleasant to find that respect which it is
                    hoped<br/> may tend to strengthen the unity between them. —<br/> We should have
                    been glad to see the commissioners<br/> here, but understanding neither they nor
                    any others<br/> from a foreign state under military characters, are<br/>
                    admitted within the limits of this garrison, which<br/> includes the town that
                    consists of about one hun-<br/>dred houses; under which consideration we think
                    it<br/> cause of thankfulness for the indulgence, remarkable<br/> attention, and
                    kind treatment we have met with <br/>
<pb n="322"></pb> during our six weeks stay in this place. This even-<br/>ing, paid
                    a short visit at <a href="/people/crin1">commissary Rinold<persname key="crin1"></persname></a>'s, who,<br/>
                    with his wife and sensible daughter, appear to have<br/> as much solidity,
                    uprightness, and vital religion, as<br/> any in the place. There are a few
                    others we highly<br/> esteem, and towards whom we now feel a near
                    affec-<br/>tion on taking our solemn farewell. </p>

<p> Took leave of most of our acquaintances in<br/> town and went on board the
                    Dunmore, in which<br/> were <a href="/people/cengl1">colonel England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>
                    and several other officers; fell<br/> down to the mouth of the river, about
                    eighteen<br/> miles, and landed at <a href="/people/celli1">captain
                        Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>'s, whose house<br/> the commissioners had taken, being
                    large and con-<br/>venient for their purpose. We were truly glad to<br/> see
                    them, and they us. Here the vessel is ordered<br/> to lay until we are ready to
                    go forward to <a href="/places/sandu">Sandus-ky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, which depends
                    on the time the Indians say they<br/> are ready. It was pleasant to behold the
                    friend-<br/>ship apparent between the <a href="/people/cengl1">colonel<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a>
                    with the other<br/> British officers, and our commissioners. This place<br/> is
                    very agreeable; there being a large farm, with<br/> fields well stored with
                    grain, standing in shock —<br/>supposed to be about one thousand bushels; a
                    large<br/> new barn eighty feet long and about thirty-six<br/>wide; round the
                    house a beautiful green, on which<br/> we encamped with fourteen tents, large
                    and small,<br/> containing our little company and the commission-<br/>ers'
                    train, with some British officers who designed<br/> to go with us to the grand
                    treaty. The commis-<br/>sioners gave us the substance of what passed
                    be-<br/>tween them and the Indian deputies at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>: all<br/> which appeared encouraging, and favourable
                    towards<br/> an accommodation. We dined and supped all toge-<br/>ther, and slept
                    quiet and well in our tents. </p>

<p> Spent the day very agreeably together,<br/> having one general table. At night
                    we had a great<br/> rain and heavy thunder; our tents not as well
                    forti-<br/>fied as might have been. Towards day some of us<br/> got very wet by
                    the water coming in; but through<br/> Divine favour we were preserved. </p>

<p> A fine morning. Having an opportunity to<br/> go to Detroit in a small boat with
                        <a href="/people/gsensi">Gotlieb Sensiman<persname key="gsensi"></persname></a>,<br/> a <a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravian<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a> minister from <geogname key="thame">Latrench river</geogname>, and three<br/> Indians of their family, we
                    embraced it. <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and myself
                    took our passage in order to do<br/> some business for the commissioners, and a
                    little for<br/> ourselves. The wind was ahead and we had to row<br/> all the
                    way, Went to our old quarters. </p>

<p> First of the week. I felt weary with yester-<br/>day's hard rowing, and almost
                    ready to give out the<br/> prospect of a meeting. But towards evening, at<br/>
                    about an hour's notice, we met at the old sail loft<br/> with many of the
                    inhabitants, who appeared glad of<br/> the opportunity, and it was satisfactory
                    to ourselves. </p>

<p> The colonel's boat going down the river to<br/> our camp, with <a href="/people/cfree1">captains Freeman<persname key="cfree1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jbroa1">Broadhead<persname key="jbroa1"></persname></a>,<br/> we were invited to return with them; but our
                    busi-<br/>ness not being completed, I concluded to stay, and<br/> take my
                    passage in the schooner Nancy, bound to<br/>
<a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, and <a href="/people/wsave1">William

<p> I went on board the schooner, and near<br/> night landed at our camp, where I
                    was informed a<br/> deputation of Indians from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname> had been here,<br/> and held a conference with the
                    commissioners. They<br/> appeared uneasy with what had passed at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>,<br/> asserting that nothing short of
                        <geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname> being the<br/> line, would
                    satisfy them; they requested the com-<br/>missioners’ <pb n="324"></pb> answer
                    to-morrow, on that head, and re-<br/>tired over the river. This unexpected
                    change look-<br/>ed again discouraging; believing our worthy com-<br/>missioners
                    had nothing but upright views in their<br/> proceedings, consistent with the
                    trust reposed in them<br/> by the government of the United States. Though<br/>
                    what their views are, is yet unknown to us; but we<br/> hope, and expect, they
                    will be generous and liberal,<br/> evincing to the world that the present
                    proceedings<br/> and designs of the <a href="/organizations/usag">United States<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>
                    are founded on<br/> reason, equity, and justice. And so far as this may<br/> be
                    the case, we hope the Lord may be on our side,<br/> in this our trying
                    situation. </p>

<p> In the afternoon the Indians came over, and<br/> being seated on the beautiful
                    green in the shade of<br/> some trees, the commissioners came forth with
                    their<br/> speech in writing, which was interpreted by <a href="/people/tjones">Tho-mas Jones<persname key="tjones"></persname></a>, from the <a href="/places/genec">Genesee<placename key="genec"></placename></a>, in the Seneca lan-<br/>guage. In it was contained many
                    candid and gen-<br/>erous proposals; but not coming up so fully to their<br/>
                    demands as they seemed to wish, they declined to<br/> make any reply at present.
                    But having the paper<br/> given to them, said they would consider it
                    mature-<br/>ly, and return an answer tomorrow. On which the<br/> council broke
                    up, and the Indians returned again to<br/>
<geogname key="whiti">Whitewood Island</geogname>, opposite to our camp.
                    Among<br/> these were the chiefs often different nations, who ap-<br/>peared in
                    council solid and sober. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-08-01">8th mo. 1st</date>. <geogname key="detror" type="unattested"></geogname></dateline>
<p> The Indian deputies returned in the<br/> morning early, and being seated, the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> chief<br/> called <a href="/people/carry1">Carry-all-about<persname key="carry1"></persname></a>, whose name signifies King of<br/>
                    all the western nations up the Lakes, — made a short<br/> speech, importing,
                        <said who="carry1">That many treaties had been<br/> held at different places
                        from time to time, wherein <br/>
<pb n="325"></pb> you say lands have been purchased; but would ac-<br/>knowledge
                        no legal and permanent conveyance<br/> since the treaty at <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, twenty-five years<br/> ago. So
                        that the lands on this side the <geogname key="ohior"> Ohio</geogname>
                        are<br/> ours, and the lands on the other side are yours. — <br/> And you
                        may go home and tell <a href="/people/gwash1">Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a> what<br/>
                        we say. We understand all you said to us very<br/> well, and we expect you
                        understand us.</said>
<a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a> was their interpreter. After
                    rising up and<br/> stepping off a few yards, they found a mistake in<br/>
                    expression, and recalled their words, desiring the<br/> commissioners would stay
                    where they are, till they<br/> could go to the council and return with an
                    answer,<br/> which, if favoured with wind and weather, may be<br/> accomplished
                    in about five days. We had some de-<br/>sire to go with them to the <a href="/places/miamr1">Rapids<placename key="miamr1"></placename></a>, as <a href="/people/celli1">captain
                            El-liot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/tmcke1">captain Thomas

                    not approbated;<br/> and as our letters sent by <a href="/people/celli1">captain
                        Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a> had not<br/> been forwarded by him on account of his
                    meeting<br/> the commissioners here, who thought proper to de-<br/>tain them,
                    concluding we should have an opportu-<br/>nity shortly to see them ourselves, —
                    after opening<br/> and reading them, and adding a short postscript, we<br/> were
                    encouraged to send them forward, though at a<br/> late stage.</p>

<p> Towards evening, several of us in company<br/> with our good old general, took a
                    walk up the river<br/> about a mile, and drank tea at <a href="/people/jcol">James
                        Colwell<persname key="jcol"></persname></a>’s. The<br/> result of this great business is cause of
                    much close<br/> exercise at times — our minds being made sensible<br/> that
                    nothing but supernatural wisdom will do for us<br/> to lean to. </p>

<p> The sloop Detroit came to, here, on her way <br/>
<pb n="326"></pb> to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, from <a href="/places/michi"> Michillimackinac<placename key="michi"></placename></a>, loaded with<br/> peltry, having
                    on board three hundred and thirty-<br/> three packs, the greatest part supposed
                    to be worth<br/> twenty guineas each. So great is the fur trade in<br/> this
                    country, that it is almost beyond description.<br/> In the afternoon, <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> and myself took a<br/> walk to
                        <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>'s, and from thence about
                    half<br/> a mile further down the lake, where we saw some<br/> plain traces of
                    one of the very old forts, among the<br/> many that are in divers parts of this
                    country, of<br/> which the present Indians can give no account from<br/>
                    tradition or otherwise. </p>

<p> First of the week. We held a small meet-<br/>ing at <a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon
                        Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a>'s, we hope to profit: — himself<br/> gone to the Indian
                    council with the deputies that<br/> were here from the Rapids.<a href="/people/wsave1"> William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and<br/> myself being comrades in a
                    small tent, our bedding<br/> got a good deal wet with the great rain that fell
                    to-<br/>day, and having no opportunity for drying, we slept<br/> on them as they
                    were. In the morning, felt well,<br/> which is an additional cause of
                    thankfulness for the<br/> many favours we have received. </p>

<p> We have frequent visits from the town, —<br/> and this day came <a href="/people/jabbo1">James Abbot<persname key="jabbo1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wbo">William
                        Bow<persname key="wbo"></persname></a>, and<br/> — Sportsman, in a small sail boat. Our friend<br/>
<a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a>, paid a visit to the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> Indian<br/> town about four miles from our
                    camp. This night<br/> was the most general complaint of the musketoes I<br/>
                    have yet heard since our encamping here. Most of<br/> us got little sleep either
                    in the house, tents, or on<br/> ship board. Towards day the weather grew
                    colder<br/> — wind N. W. which caused an increase of muske-<br/>toes in our
                    tents. </p>

<p> One of the servants of <a href="/people/celli1">captain Elliot<persname key="celli1"></persname></a>, called <br/>
<pb n="327"></pb>
<a href="/people/tob">Toby<persname key="tob"></persname></a>, a <a href="/organizations/pawnee">Pawnee<orgname key="pawnee"></orgname></a>
                    slave, who has lain near a year in<br/> a consumption, died about two o'clock
                    this afternoon. </p>
<p> I was with him for about an hour before he depart-<br/>ed, and speaking with him
                    about fifteen minutes be-<br/>fore he breathed his last, found he was sensible
                    of<br/> death being upon him. He said he understood all<br/> I said to him, and
                    was glad he was noticed in his<br/> last moments. I think I never saw before so
                    hasty<br/> a burial. His coffin was made immediately, and his<br/> interment
                    took place about sunset, in a grave near-<br/>by on the bank of the river,
                    attended by about twen-<br/>ty people, whites, blacks, and Indians. This
                    was<br/> the end of poor <a href="/people/tob">Toby<persname key="tob"></persname></a>. </p>

                    At night<br/> the wind came strong from the south, with much<br/> rain.<a href="/people/wcol">William<persname key="wcol"></persname></a> and I got a little wet again, but are<br/>

<p> Two Indians came from the <geogname key="miamr1">Rapids</geogname>, by whom<br/>
                    we received letters from <a href="/people/haupa1">captain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>, a

                    opinion there<br/> will be peace. This was pleasant, indeed, and we<br/> sat up
                    this evening, conversing with the commis-<br/>sioners till past eleven o'clock.
                    Slept well, being<br/> clear of musketoes. </p>

                    whose reports agree in substance with <a href="/people/haupa1">captain

                    the musketoes, caused little sleep. </p>

<p> Great looking out for the boat's return from<br/>
<pb n="328"></pb> the council, for which we are very anxious. The<br/> season
                    advancing, and the great distance we are<br/> from home, together with the
                    continued uncertainty<br/> of succeeding, according to our wishes, in the
                    great<br/> business we are engaged in, accompanied with other<br/> unpleasant
                    circumstances, give us at times some very<br/> disagreeable sensations. Yet on
                    the whole, we are<br/> preserved in a good degree of patience, still
                    believing<br/> our coming out was right, be the event as it may. </p>

<p> First of the week. No arrival from the <geogname key="miamr1">Ra-<br/>pids
                    </geogname> to alleviate our strong desires and anxiety to see<br/> the Indians.
                    With some difficulty we got to <a href="/places/gisle">Grose
                        Isle<placename key="gisle"></placename></a>, where we held a meeting with some of its in-<br/>habitants
                    and divers from the main, to a good de-<br/>gree of satisfaction. This morning,
                        <a href="/people/jparr2">Jasper Parrish<persname key="jparr2"></persname></a>,<br/> who had been express
                    to Philadelphia, the second<br/> time, arrived in the ship Ottoway, from <a href="/places/ferie">Fort

                    <persname key="jparr2"></persname></a>both<br/> poorly. At night our rest was much disturbed by<br/> the
                    musketoes. We have frequent visits from small<br/> parties of Indians, who
                    sometimes find means to get<br/> too much rum, and are then troublesome;
                    otherwise<br/> they are quiet and civil. Fresh provisions are plen-<br/>ty here;

<p> Felt dull and heavy in body and mind --<br/>We have a <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> Indian, who stays much with<br/> us. He often goes out to
                    hunt, and brings in plenty<br/> of ducks, &amp;c. for which he gets well paid.
                    He ap-<br/>pears to be a sensible man, speaks many languages<br/> in the Indian
                    tongue and some English. Two men<br/> came from the other side of the river, and
                    informed<br/> the boats were coming from the council to invite us <br/>to the
                    treaty. </p>

<p> In the afternoon came two young Indian<br/> men, (<a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>) they looked wild and afraid; one<br/> of them was
                    introduced to <a href="/people/glinc1">general Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, and<br/> handed
                    him a message in writing, from the great<br/> council, informing, that the
                    several treaties at <a href="/places/fmint">Fort M'Intosh<placename key="fmint"></placename></a>,
                        <a href="/places/miam">Miami<placename key="miam"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/musk">Muskingum<placename key="musk"></placename></a>, &amp;c, where lands<br/> had been ceded by two or
                    three nations only, were<br/> not valid, as they had no right to cede lands.
                    And<br/> as for the large sums of money proposed to be given<br/> for their
                    country, they did not want it, and a great<br/> many of them did not know the
                    use of it: therefore<br/> desired it might be applied with the proposed
                    sala-<br/>ry, to the indemnification of the settlers north of<br/> the
                        <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>. And as they supposed they were
                    mostly<br/> poor people, or they would not have settled on dis-<br/>puted lands,
                    they now proposed that government <br/> should give the money to them. It would
                    be a suf-<br/>ficient compensation to those settlers, and might in-<br/>duce
                    them to move quietly somewhere else, out of<br/> the Indian country — and make
                    the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> the bounda-<br/>ry: for it was their
                    land. And signified, as the<br/> land to the westward was filled up, they had
                    no-<br/>where to repair to, and were now determined to lay <br/><pb n="330"></pb>
                    their bones in that country. As to the concessions<br/> the commissioners
                    proposed making, by giving mo-<br/>ney, they did not want it; and running a new
                    line<br/> was but giving them a part of their own land. And<br/> as to
                    disclaiming the right to all their country by<br/> virtue of the peace made with
                    the king, their father,<br/> they knew they never were conquered, and the
                    pre-<br/>emption right agreed on by the British and United<br/> States,
                    concerning the purchasing of their country,<br/> could not be binding on them;
                    for they supposed<br/> they had a right to sell their lands to whom they<br/>
                    pleased. Upon the whole, it was received as a very<br/> contemptible speech, by
                    our commissioners — which<br/> soon appeared to be the case, as the baggage
                    was<br/> ordered on board, and caused an alarm in our camp. </p>
<p> Some for safety proposed to lodge on board the ship,<br/> and divers tents were
                    struck. Some went on board,<br/> and others took to the house for safety. This
                    pros-<br/>pect, all on a sudden, looked gloomy, and Friends<br/> got together to
                    feel if any thing further opened for<br/> us to do. We felt much shut up; — and
                    as we had <br/> never been called into council with the commission-<br/>ers, nor
                    had any public conference with the Indians,<br/> we were obliged to bear our own
                    burthens, and sub-<br/>mit the awful subject to the interposition of the
                    Di-<br/>vine hand, and turn our faces homeward to our dear<br/> friends and
                    connections, in hopes of reaching our<br/> Yearly Meeting. </p>
<p> This evening, two runners who were despatched<br/> three days ago, returned with
                    a verbal message from<br/> the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Five Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, who
                    expected us to come for-<br/>ward, and were moving six miles down the river
                    to<br/> meet us. They having all along appeared very<br/> friendly to the
                        <a href="/organizations/usag">United States<orgname key="usag"></orgname></a>, this appeared an art-<br/><pb n="331"></pb> ful manoeuvre, on one side or the other. It was<br/> somewhat
                    extraordinary to hear <a href="/people/glinc1">general Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>
                    ex-<br/>press, that they had received just such an answer as<br/> he could have
                    wished. What his meaning was, is<br/> unknown. Friends slept in their tents as
                    heretofore,<br/> I believe with little fear. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-08-17">17th</date>. <geogname key="detror" type="unattested"></geogname></dateline>
<p> We were hurried on board soon after break-<br/>fast, with the remainder of "our
                    baggage. Two run-<br/>ners were dispatched by the commissioners to the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, the object unknown to us. About
                    ele-<br/>ven o'clock, we were all on board, and stood down<br/> the river into
                    the lake. My mind felt sorrowful and<br/> very heavy, reflecting on the
                    important subject of<br/> our journey; but I could see nothing material
                    omit-<br/>ted on our part, to give uneasiness: so I endeavoured<br/> to rest
                    quiet, leaving the event to Him who judgeth<br/> righteously. In this part of
                    the world, but little mo-<br/>rality, law, or religion, appears to govern the
                    peo-<br/>ple, though the climate is blessed with health and<br/> there is plenty
                    of the good things of this life; no-<br/>thing being wanting but industry and
                    thankful<br/> hearts. </p>

<p> First of the week. We came to anchor<br/> among a cluster of islands in the west
                    end of the<br/> lake; of which there is said to be about thirty, great<br/> and
                    small. Some of them produce abundance of red<br/> cedar, much used in ship
                    building — there are also<br/> raccoons and many other wild animals on them.
                    We<br/> stood out into the open lake with pleasant weather.<br/> Had a season of
                    solid retirement in the cabin, with <br/> a few of our fellow passengers, to a
                    good degree of<br/>satisfaction and comfort; though held in much con-<br/>tempt
                    by others, who supposed themselves wise and <br/> good enough already. </p>

                    one to another, at times, was truly<br/> distressing, though otherwise we were

                    landed, as the lake<br/> was rough, which caused a great surf. <date when="1793-08-24">24th</date>. Morn-<br/>ing fair and calm — a great stir,
                    hoisting out casks,<br/> trunks, &amp;c. The commissioners preparing to set<br/>
                    forward, some by water, others by land. <a href="/people/wsave1">William

                    truly we may say, by<br/> this time, we became pretty much stript of the

                    let out of prison. Here we<br/> were kindly treated and lodged; proposing to
                    visit a <br/>
<pb n="333"></pb> number of Friends and friendly people, in and about<br/> this
                    neighborhood, before we set out for home;<br/> which seemed annexed to my

<p> First of the week. We held a public meet-<br/>ing, and visited a few families —
                    towards evening,<br/> got to <a href="/people/ascho1">Asa Schooley's<persname key="ascho1"></persname></a>,

<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> came to us this morning — so<br/>
                    that we are now all together again. We went to <a href="/people/jherr1">John

                    family and the family of <a href="/people/jcutl1">John Cutler<persname key="jcutl1"></persname></a>,
                    together; — after which, went to <a href="/people/dpoun1">Daniel

<p> We held a public meeting at <a href="/people/jhave1">Joseph

                    had a select opportunity with such as profess<br/> with Friends, a number of
                    them being members, to<br/> whom some interesting matters of advice were
                    com-<br/>municated. Upon the whole, we thought it a very<br/> solid and
                    profitable opportunity, many hearts being<br/>tendered; for whom, in their
                    lonely situation, we<br/> were brought into near sympathy. We parted from<br/>
                    them in much love. <a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> and myself
                    went<br/> to <a href="/people/ezden">Ezekiel Dennis<persname key="ezden"></persname></a>'s, up the side of

                        <a href="/places/ebin">point Ebino<placename key="ebin"></placename></a>, where we were kind-<br/>ly
                    entertained and lodged. I think when the meet-<br/>ing was select as above
                    mentioned, there was in the<br/> whole, young and old, about forty — many
                    decent<br/> looking young people, with innocent countenances,<br/> were present;
                    on account of whom I felt much con-<br/>cern for their religious and school

<p> Set out and rode up the beautiful beach on<br/> the lake shore, about ten miles,
                    to what is called the<br/>
<a href="/places/suga">Sugar Loaf<placename key="suga"></placename></a>, a point of land extending out in
                    the<br/> lake, with a remarkable round hill, at a distance re-<br/>sembling a
                    sugar loaf. Here we visited seven fami-<br/>lies, and returned in the evening to

<p> With divers other Friends, we went about<br/> twelve miles to <a href="/people/jpowe1">esquire Powell<persname key="jpowe1"></persname></a>'s, where we had a<br/> large public
                    meeting of Friends and others, to much<br/>satisfaction to ourselves, and I
                    believe it was so to the<br/> auditory. They behaved quiet, and with
                    becoming<br/> decency. After which many Friends took leave of<br/> us in much
                    love and tenderness, and departed to<br/> their several homes. We dined with the
                    squire, be-<br/>ing freely and liberally entertained. Afterwards I<br/> rode
                    about four miles to the fort, and went on board<br/> the Dunmore on a small
                    errand, with our friend <a href="/people/wlund1">Wil-liam Lundy<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>,
                    who having heard of our being here,<br/> came about twenty miles to see us, and
                    was at the<br/> meeting to-day. In the evening went to our friend<br/>
<a href="/people/bwill1">Benjamin Willson<persname key="bwill1"></persname></a>'s — leaving the other Friends
                    at<br/> Powell's. <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott <persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>had been very
                    poorly with<br/> the ague and fever — am fearful he will hardly be<br/> able to
                    ride very soon, which is now a great trial to<br/> us, being very desirous to
                    move towards home -- </p>

<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> now bravely, though weak,<br/>

                    States, and is very desirous of our<br/> company. Then went to <a href="/people/powel1">Powell<persname key="powel1"></persname></a>'s, and thence to<br/>
<a href="/people/wind1">Windecker<persname key="wind1"></persname></a>'s, the ferryman, where <a href="/people/alain">Abraham Laing<persname key="alain"></persname></a><br/> came to us — we crossed over and

                    rode about forty miles; night came on, and we<br/> halted by the side of a small

                    on<br/> with heavy thunder and rain. We made out to get<br/> a fire kindled,
                    which was a comfort to us; but we<br/> got very wet. The wind being high,
                    several trees<br/> fell near us, which was somewhat alarming. The<br/> gust held
                    about two hours, and then cleared up with<br/> bright starlight the remainder of
                    the night. We all<br/> lay before the fire, in the best manner we could,
                    in<br/>our wet situation, got some sleep, but were some<br/>what afflicted with
                    the musketoes. On the whole,<br/> we thought ourselves much favoured. </p>

                        Laing<persname key="alain"></persname></a> to come on as well<br/> as he could, in hopes that he may
                    overtake us at<br/>
<a href="/places/muncy">Muncy<placename key="muncy"></placename></a>. We rode seventeen miles to <a href="/people/jkyle1">James Kyle<persname key="jkyle1"></persname></a>'s,<br/> and dined — thence fourteen miles
                    to our friend<br/>
<a href="/people/sharr">Samuel Harris<persname key="sharr"></persname></a>'s, at <a href="/places/loyal">Loyalsock<placename key="loyal"></placename></a>, where <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                    Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a><br/> and myself lodged, leaving <persname key="jlind1"></persname>Jacob
                    Lindley and <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> five miles hack
                    to get their horses shod. —<br/> Here we heard of great sickness in
                    Philadelphia. </p>

<p> First of the week. After breakfast, <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob
                        Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> came
                    up, and we went to<br/>
<a href="/organizations/muncym">Muncy<orgname key="muncym"></orgname></a> meeting. Here we met with a number of<br/>
                    our dear friends. This seemed very pleasant, and<br/> we had a solid, favoured
                    time together. After which<br/> we went to our friend <a href="/people/swall1">Samuel Wallace<persname key="swall1"></persname></a>'s and dined,<br/> then disposed of ourselves in
                    several places to lodge.<br/> I went to <a href="/people/hpark1">Henry
                        Parker<persname key="hpark1"></persname></a>'s. We all felt a little of<br/> the effects , of lying in
                    the damp woods in our wet<br/> clothes, and hard travelling for two days past,
                    with<br/> rough roads, and crossing many creeks; one called<br/>
<geogname key="trout">Trout run</geogname>, we crossed thirty times, and
                        <geogname key="lycom3">Lycoming<br/> creek</geogname> seven times — with
                    several large mountains, <br/>
<pb n="338"></pb> one of which was a part of the <geogname key="allemo">Alleghany</geogname>. The<br/> sickness in Philadelphia confirmed in every
                    place. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-09-09">9th</date>. <placename key="muncy"></placename></dateline>
<p> Not feeling quite clear of this neighbour-<br/>hood, we held another meeting at
                        <a href="/organizations/muncym">Muncy <orgname key="muncym"></orgname></a>meeting<br/> house, which was larger
                    than yesterday, and much<br/> favoured. After dinner, went back six miles to
                        <a href="/people/sharr">Sa-muel Harris<persname key="sharr"></persname></a>'s, over the very large
                    and rapid creek<br/> called <geogname key="loyac">Loyalsock</geogname>. Here we
                    had a large and satisfac-<br/>tory meeting. Most of our company returned, but
                    I<br/> stayed here. </p>

<p> Our friend S. H., an ancient man, has lain<br/> poorly for some time, and not
                    likely to continue<br/> long. He seems quiet and calm, and told me this<br/>
                    morning, he felt bravely refreshed, and much satis-<br/>fied with the meeting,
                    and the company of his friends.<br/> I took a solemn leave of him and the
                    family, and pro-<br/>ceeded to <a href="/people/swall1">Wallace<persname key="swall1"></persname></a>'s. We
                    then all set out together,<br/> and rode to <a href="/people/welli1">William
                        Ellis<persname key="welli1"></persname></a>'s, where we settled the<br/> running accounts we had among
                    ourselves. Our<br/> friend <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>
                    concluded here to leave us,<br/> and proceed home by way of <a href="/places/harrisb">Harrisburgh<placename key="harrisb"></placename></a>. We<br/> then went on, having
                        <a href="/people/jcarp1">Joseph Carpenter<persname key="jcarp1"></persname></a> for a guide,<br/>
                    eighteen miles toward <a href="/places/catta">Catawissa<placename key="catta"></placename></a>, and put up at
                    our<br/> friend <a href="/people/jeves1">John Eves<persname key="jeves1"></persname></a>'s, at <a href="/places/fishi">Fishing creek<placename key="fishi"></placename></a>, where we were<br/> kindly

<p> Here we had a meeting with a few Friends<br/> and divers of their neighbours, in
                    a school house, to<br/> a good degree of satisfaction and comfort. Set out<br/>
                    in company with <a href="/people/ijam2">Isaac James<persname key="ijam2"></persname></a>, brother to
                        <a href="/people/jjam3">John<persname key="jjam3"></persname></a>, in<br/> Philadelphia, and rode about
                    twelve miles to <a href="/places/catta">Catta-wissa<placename key="catta"></placename></a>, crossing the
                    north-east branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Susque-<br/>hanna</geogname>, and
                    put up at our friend <a href="/people/jlloy1">John Lloyd<persname key="jlloy1"></persname></a>'s. Here<br/>
                    is a small town of about thirty buildings. I lodged<br/> at <a href="/people/jwat2">James Watson<persname key="jwat2"></persname></a>'s, <a href="/people/jparr1">John

<pb n="339"></pb> poorly, <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> stopped
                    about eight miles short<br/> of this, at <a href="/people/jwill1">John

<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> came to us this morning. On<br/>
                    his way he called to see an ancient Friend, now in<br/> the ninety-seventh year
                    of her age. We had no<br/> public meeting here, but visited most of the
                    families<br/> of Friends in town, wherein our friend <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Par-rish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> had good service, and was much favoured. In<br/>
                    the afternoon we rode about nine miles to <a href="/places/roarc">Roaring
                        creek <placename key="roarc"></placename></a>. This part of the country is hilly and moun-<br/>tainous,

                    up at <a href="/people/swebb2">Samuel Webb<persname key="swebb2"></persname></a>'s, having crossed the

<p> First of the week. <a href="/people/jwrig1">Joseph Wright<persname key="jwrig1"></persname></a>, living<br/>
                    in one part of the house with his family, has lately<br/> been afflicted with
                    the bloody flux, by which he had<br/> lost three children. Divers Friends came
                    here to<br/> see us, viz. <a href="/people/jstar1">John Starr<persname key="jstar1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="/people/twrig1">Thomas Wright<persname key="twrig1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/lpilk">Levi
                        Pil-kington<persname key="lpilk"></persname></a>, &amp;c. We all attended their sa meeting at
                        <a href="/organizations/maide">Mai-den creek<orgname key="maide"></orgname></a> — and after dinner
                    proceeded nine miles to<br/>
<a href="/places/readi">Reading,<placename key="readi"></placename></a> where we put up at <a href="/people/sjack1">Samuel Jackson<persname key="sjack1"></persname></a>'s. —<br/> The sickness, and distress
                    in consequence thereof,<br/> we still hear confirmed, and much talked of, as
                    still<br/> raging to a great degree in <a href="/places/phila">
                        Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> — which, I <br/>
<pb n="340"></pb> expect will be a trying circumstance to many friends<br/> in the
                    country, in getting to our ensuing Yearly<br/> Meeting. May the good hand be

<a href="/people/swall1">Samuel Wallace<persname key="swall1"></persname></a>, from <a href="/places/muncy">Muncy<placename key="muncy"></placename></a>, called to see<br/> us. He left the city yesterday, and
                    confirms the<br/> accounts of the sickness and mortality to be quite<br/> equal
                    to what we have heard — and that the principal<br/> nurses for the sick, and
                    buriers of the dead, are the<br/> blacks, of whom it is said, very few or none
                    have<br/> yet taken the disorder. After breakfast we set out<br/> and rode
                    twenty-three miles to <a href="/people/jpot">Joseph Potts<persname key="jpot"></persname></a>'s, <br/>where
                    we lodged. Here we again heard much of<br/> the distressed situation of
                        <a href="/places/phila"> Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. Our friend<br/>
<a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a> left <a href="/people/jparr1">John

<p> I have been these two days past, poorly<br/> with a cold, and very hoarse; but
                    through favour, this<br/> morning, feel some better. <a href="/people/jparr1">John
                        Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> was taken<br/> in a carriage by a friend, proposing to go

                    was gone, intending<br/> to go by <a href="/people/jfiel">John Field<persname key="jfiel"></persname></a>'s,
                    who with many others are<br/> out of town. At the same time I set out with
                    my<br/> friend <a href="/people/jpot">Joseph Potts<persname key="jpot"></persname></a>, and rode nine miles
                    to <a href="/places/germa">German-town<placename key="germa"></placename></a>. Called at <a href="/people/hdrin1">Henry Drinker<persname key="hdrin1"></persname></a>'s, who with his<br/> family were here.
                    From thence went with <a href="/people/hdrin1">Henry<persname key="hdrin1"></persname></a><br/> to <a href="/people/jpemb1">John Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>'s, who was here also with his
                    <br/>family. Having heard that <a href="/people/grand1">Beverly

                    about three miles from<br/> this, and being desirous to see him, towards
                    even-<br/>ing, <a href="/people/jpemb1">John Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/hdrin1">Henry Drinker<persname key="hdrin1"></persname></a> and myself<br/> went there in
                        <a href="/people/jpemb1">John<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>'s carriage. We were glad to see<br/>
                    each other again, and after spending about an hour <br/>and a half together in
                    free conversation, returned to <br/>
<pb n=" 341"></pb>
<placename key="germa"></placename>Germantown, where I lodged at my friend <a href="/people/jjohn5">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn5"></persname></a>'s. </p>

<p> The weather dry and warm — thought to be<br/> rather unfavorable to the sick in
                    the city, where<br/> deaths and burials are frequent through the day. —<br/>
                    Here I met with my friend <a href="/people/slund1">Sarah Lundy<persname key="slund1"></persname></a>, who
                    is<br/> on her way to the Yearly Meeting, and a proposed<br/> visit to the
                    Southern States. Also, again met with<br/> my dear friend, <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>, who came in last<br/> evening, his
                    wife being here, and having taken<br/> lodgings at <a href="/people/chain1">Caspar
                        Haines<persname key="chain1"></persname></a>'s. We were all together<br/> at their <a href="/organizations/germpm">preparative meeting<orgname key="germpm"></orgname></a>, where divers weighty<br/>
                    testimonies were delivered by <a href="/people/slund1">Sarah Lundy<persname key="slund1"></persname></a>
                    and<br/> others; and solemn supplication by <a href="/people/wsave1">William

<a href="/people/whart">Wm. Hartshorne<persname key="whart"></persname></a> returned home from <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, <br/>well. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-09-21">21st</date>. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p> This being the day for opening our select <br/><a href="/organizations/pym">Yearly
                        Meeting<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>, it was exceedingly trying to many<br/> Friends, on
                    account of the prevailing and mortal<br/> disorder raging in the city, where it
                    is said from a <br/>hundred to a hundred and fifty of a day, have been<br/>
                    taken to their graves. I was much exercised in<br/> mind on that account, being
                    yet poorly with my<br/> cold, which 1 now apprehend to be what is common-<br/>ly
                    called the influenza; — however, on the whole, I<br/> thought I felt most easy
                    to go forward, and rode<br/> into <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, attended the meeting at Fourth<br/> street, which
                    was a solid, favoured time, though <br/>very small. There were some Friends from
                    every<br/> Quarter, though many of the representatives were<br/> absent. I think
                    from one meeting there was but<br/> one answered. The number on the women's
                    side<br/> of the house, in the whole, twenty-four. I dined at<br/>
<a href="/people/twist1">Thomas Wistar<persname key="twist1"></persname></a>'s, and towards evening returned
                    to <br/>
<pb n="342"></pb>
<a href="/places/germa">Germantown<placename key="germa"></placename></a>, feeling myself very poorly with
                    great<br/> debility. While in the city, I had occasion to pass<br/> by Friends'
                    burial ground, the <geogname key="pfiel">Potter's field</geogname>-, and<br/>
                    several others. The prospect was awful and alarm-<br/>ing, to behold the many
                    new graves, and others dig-<br/>ging, with the hearses standing, and some
                    coming<br/> and going — most of which were attended by the<br/> black people,
                    whom it is said the disorder has not <br/>reached. This is a token of mercy,
                    mixed with<br/> judgment, both to them and the whites, they being<br/> the
                    principal nurses and carriers of the dead. I am<br/> hardly able to describe my
                    feelings on the present<br/> occasion, believing it to be all in wisdom, and
                    hoping<br/> it may have a tendency to bring the lofty from their<br/> seats, and
                    beget greater humility than has of latter<br/> time appeared in that highly
                    favoured city. </p>

<p> First of the week. The weather much the<br/> same as many days past. I felt very
                    weak and poor-<br/>ly; did not go out to meeting, but kept in my quar-<br/>ters,
                    where I was very kindly and tenderly treated,<br/> wanting for nothing the house
                    could afford to make<br/> me comfortable. <a href="/people/jjohn5">John
                        Johnson<persname key="jjohn5"></persname></a> and his wife <persname key="rjohn2"></persname>Rachel,<br/> appear
                    to be tender-hearted, sympathizing friends,<br/> blessed with a plenty of the
                    good things of this life,<br/> and an open disposition to communicate freely
                    to<br/> those that are in need. May the Lord reward them,<br/> as good stewards
                    of the manifold favours received. </p>

<p> This day our general <a href="/organizations/pym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> be-<br/>gins,
                    at ten o'clock in the morning. I much desired<br/> to be there; but remaining
                    poorly, concluded to lay<br/> by another day for rest. I think I now feel the
                    ef-<br/>fects of hard riding through the wilderness, and ly-<br/>ing on the damp
                    ground; being stiffened, with sore-<br/>ness in my bones. <a href="/people/jelli1">John Elliott<persname key="jelli1"></persname></a>, I hear, has been <br/>
<pb n="343"></pb> poorly since his arrival in town. Neither he nor<br/>
<a href="/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> was at meeting on seventh-day.
                        <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> and myself were there,<br/> and glad to see each
                    other again in that place; and<br/> many friends expressed their gladness at our
                    safe<br/> return. </p>

<p> The weather dry and warm, the roads very<br/> dusty. This morning felt better.
                    Leaving my horse<br/> here, I rode into town with my friend <a href="/people/jjohn5">John John-son<persname key="jjohn5"></persname></a>, in a chair -- attended two
                    sittings of our Yearly<br/> Meeting, which was much smaller than usual. Our<br/>
                    friend <a href="/people/nwai1">Nicholas Wain<persname key="nwai1"></persname></a>, was again chosen clerk
                    for<br/> the present year; and the business went on in much <br/>brotherly love
                    and concord — a good degree of so-<br/>lemnity and weight attending. I lodged at
                        <a href="/people/thou1">Thomas Hough&gt;<persname key="thou1"></persname></a>'s. </p>

<p> The weather much the same. I continue<br/> tolerable well in health; but weak
                    and some cough.<br/> Attended the meeting as yesterday. Dined at <a href="/people/nwai1">N. Wain<persname key="nwai1"></persname></a>'s, and lodged at <a href="/people/jjam3">John James<persname key="jjam3"></persname></a>'s. </p>

<dateline><date when="1793-09-26">26th</date>, and fifth of the week. <placename key="phila"></placename></dateline>
<p> The meeting assem-<br/>bledagain at nine o'clock, and the business
                    conclu-<br/>ded before twelve, in solemn quiet, and, I believe,<br/> to the
                    satisfaction of all present. After which, I <br/>dined with my friend <a href="/people/dbaco1">David Bacon<persname key="dbaco1"></persname></a>, and returned to <br/><a href="/places/germa">Germantown<placename key="germa"></placename></a> with my kind friend, <a href="/people/jjohn5">John Johnson<persname key="jjohn5"></persname></a>,<br/> who had also attended all the
                    sittings of this Yearly<br/> Meeting. The sickness in town continues as
                    here-<br/>tofore. Divers friends in the city are paying con-<br/>stant attention
                    to the sick — providing necessaries,<br/> nurses, coffins, and carriers of the
                    dead. At which<br/> I felt glad, and hope they will be rewarded for their<br/>
                    labours in so great and charitable a work. </p>
