<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<p>Brothers!<br/> Your letter of 8th month last was reciev'd<br/> and read
                            amongst us. We rejoice to hear of your welfare <br/> and of the
                            resolution you have made to refrain from strong <br/> drinks, it is a
                            good beginning towards your improvement and <br/> we have no doubt as
                            you keep to it, you will be able to <br/> cultivate your lands better,
                            and by industry soon live more</p>
<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_002" n="2"></pb>
<p>more comfortably on the fruits thereof-<br/> Brothers! that you may be
                            able to keep these good<br/> resolutions, we wish you to attend very
                            carefully to what the <br/> good Spirit teaches in the heart, for it is
                            placed there as <br/> a guide to show what to do and what to leave
                            undone and<br/> to lead you and us to virtue and happiness agreeable
                            <br/> to what you will find written in that good book which<br/> your
                            Brother sent you from over the great water. And altho'<br/> you may not
                            now comprehend some of the mysteries con<br/> tained in that excellent
                            book, yet, as you become more <br/> and more disposed to listen to the
                            voice of the gret and <br/> good Spirit in your hearts, your minds will
                            gradually<br/> be enlighten'd to understand the things written
                            therein,<br/> so far as is necessary for you-</p>
<p>We are also glad to find that the subject of<br/> the education of your
                            Children preposed to you by our<br/> friends who visited you last
                            summer, has been consider'd<br/> by you, and that you are desirous to
                            have a school<br/> establish'd amongst you- We wish to encourage
                            you<br/> in this good work and shall willing by advise and assist<br/>
                            you in it, believing it of great importance to your<br/> offspring whose
                            fertile minds like a well cultivated soil, <br/>
<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_003" n="3"></pb> will yield a rich harvest and amply compensate you<br/> for
                            the labour and expence bestowed on them. They will <br/> thereby be
                            rendered more comfortable to themselves and their<br/> families and
                            useful in the increasing intercourse you <br/> will unavoidably have
                            with the white people by <br/> whom you are surrounded-</p>
<p>Brothers! We often think of you your wives and<br/> little ones with love
                            and good wishes, and at this time <br/> conclude with desires that the
                            good and Almighty<br/> Father of all Nations on the Earth may by your
                            God<br/> and as we have already said that you may constantly<br/> attend
                            to the teachings of his pure Spirit in your hearts.</p>
<closer>And are unitedly your aff. friends<br/> Brothers &amp;Sisters<br/>

<p>We the Committee on the concern rela<br/>tive to the Indian Natives
                            Report! That during the course of the <br/> last <del>season</del> Year
                            the subject hath from time to time claimed our close<br/> attention, and
                            our minds have felt much engaged for the prom<br/>otion of their civil
                            and religious welfare: two Men and two Women<br/> of our number have
                            made them a visit, and spent some time<br/> amongst the different Tribes
                            and by their report we find, that<br/> notwithstanding they have made
                            considerable advances in Agricu<br/>lture and civilization in general
                            yet owing to divers of their <br/> Chiefs and others given way to the
                            pernicious practice of drinking<br/> to excess, their progress in these
                            respects is much retarded, and this<br/> weakness we fear has with some
                            of them rather increased, yet<br/> it appears that many of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> have wholly refrained<br/> from the
                            use of ardent spirits, and although they have made<br/> less advancement
                            in civilization than the other Tribes yet <br/> they seem animated to
                            labour after further improvement<br/> both civil and religious- The
                            attention of the Committee<br/> has been turned for some time to the
                            subject of encouraging<br/> some suitable Friend to reside amongst them,
                            and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John  Deane<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a> having expressed

<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> the same evil of
                            drinking to excess was<br/> painfully prevalent amongst the Men,
                            consequently the pro<br/>gress of civilization is slow. There are
                            however a few of them,<br/> and the Women generally in this Tribe who
                            are careful to<br/> avoid this pernicious practice, for whom we felt

                            and<br/> we have been united in the sentiment that the greatest<br/>
                            probability of our being permanently useful to this Peo<br/>ple is from
                            the instruction to be given the rising genera<br/>tion. To the

<opener>To the Yearly Meeting</opener>
<p>The Committee on the concern relative to the Indians<br/> have not been
                            unmindful of the trust reported in them,<br/> and although the progress
                            of this people in civilization and<br/> moral improvement may not be
                            equal to our solicitude<br/> for their welfare, yet we continue
                            impressed with a sense of<br/> the ratitude of the cause, and<br/> of
                            our duty to move in it as<br/> way may open in the clearness. Since our
                            last report a<br/> visit has been made by four of our number to the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Tribes, in each of<br/> which there were
                            individuals of both sexes who were disposed<br/> to lead lives of
                            sobriety &amp; industry, although some of the<br/> men were habituated
                            to intemperance, hence they neglected<br/> the cultivation of their
                            lands &amp; the mechanic arts.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a> the residence of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John Dean<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a> &amp; his family<br/>
                            there is a prospect of thier becoming a more improved<br/> people, and
                            from the report of the Committee we are<br/> induced to believe that the
                            endeavors of our said friend<br/> &amp; his family will prove useful in
                            divers respects.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge Tribe<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> as
                            heretofore it may be<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_024" n="24"></pb> observed there appears to be a
                            number of religiously inclined<br/> women who manifested much
                            satisfaction with the<br/> company of Friends.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> compasing that division of
                            the Tribe<br/> called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/pagan">Pagan Party<orgname key="pagan"></orgname></a>
                            &amp; residing in the south part<br/> of the settlement were
                            particularly noticed by the Committee<br/> they being generally
                            considered as sober persons, mostly<br/> abstaining from the use of
                            strong drink : they appeared<br/> very desirous of our furnishing them
                            with a School Master<br/> and we gave them some encouragement that we
                            would look<br/> out for one, and bear a reasonable proportion of
                            the<br/> expence with which they appeared satisfied; we have<br/>
                            attended thereto but have not yet succeeded in procuring<br/> a friend
                            for that purpose, and are thence induced to<br/> offer the subject to
                            the consideration of Friends at large,<br/> with a view that it may lead
                            to the attainment of this<br/> desirable object: This Tribe had been
                            solicited to accept<br/> of a School master from some other Society,
                            but<br/> refused, assigning as a reason that they preferred<br/> a
                            friend to any other. There is a School at<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>, conducted by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tdean1">Thomas Dean<persname key="tdean1"></persname></a>, son of the<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_025" n="25"></pb>
<br/>Friend, who resides in the Tribe, &amp; two at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a>
<br/>taught by natives. The Committee apprehend that the<br/> principal
                            concern of friends should be turned towards<br/> the education of their
                            children &amp; to procuring proper places<br/> for them, where they may
                            be brought up in a virtuous<br/> line of life, and in such occupations
                            as may be best calculated<br/> to promote their improvement &amp;
                            welfare.</p>

<floatingtext type="report">
<p>In a late visit made to the Indians under the care of<br/> our Yearly
                            Meeting by three of the Committee the recent<br/> appointed with one not
                            under the appointment, it was evident<br/> that although divers of the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a> Tribes,
                            continue<br/> in the habit of drinking to excess &amp; are thereby
                            prevented<br/> making much improvement in agriculture, yet there
                            are<br/> many others in this Nation &amp; particularly those of the<br/>
                            younger class who refrain from excessive drinking &amp;<br/> are making
                            considerable advancement in improving their<br/> lands, in some
                            instances to a degree beyond what we<br/> had an idea; that on the whole
                            we think there is an<br/> encouraging prospect in the nation, &amp;
                            which we attribute<br/> very much to the care &amp; exertions of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John Dean<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a> &amp; he<br/> saw, by
                            one of whom a School is continued &amp; likely to<br/> be enlarged on a
                            plan more extensively useful</p>
<p>Among those of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> there are a
                            number of<br/> families who appear to be sober &amp; industrious, &amp;
                            have<br/> improved their lands &amp; provided themselves
                            comfortable<br/> houses &amp; accommodations; &amp; there are divers
                            particularly<br/> of the women, who appear to be serious &amp;
                            religiously<br/> thoughtful. They have two Schools taught by<br/>
<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_029" n="29"></pb>
<br/>Indians, but several of their Chiefs men of abilities for<br/>
                            extensive usefulness among them are very intemperate &amp;<br/> set a
                            bad example in other respects; that from this &amp; <br/>other causes,
                            the present prospect in this nation is rather<br/> discouraging.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida Nation<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> are divided into two
                            Companies,<br/> &amp; settled in different parts of their land &amp; of
                            late a division<br/> thereof has taken place between them; and part of
                            them<br/> called Christians are generally given to excessive
                            drinking<br/> &amp; pay very little attention to improving their lands
                            &amp; have<br/> lately sold a considerable part of their tract to
                            government<br/> &amp; seem much unsettled &amp; inclining to remove to
                            the Westerward<br/> where they can follow hunting their unsual course of
                            life:<br/> that there appears to be but little prospect of doing
                            much<br/> advantageously for these. But the other part of<br/> this
                            Tribe called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/pagan">Pagans<orgname key="pagan"></orgname></a> seem settled &amp;
                            very generally<br/> abstain from the use of ardent spirit; with them
                            in<br/> a collective capacity we had a satisfactory opportunity of<br/>
                            conference; they expressed great satisfaction in the care<br/> extended
                            towards them by friends &amp; also an intention on<br/> their part to
                            pursue their advice &amp; appeared very desirous<br/> to be furnished
                            with a School Master &amp; a man &amp; his<br/> wife to instruct them in
                            thier farming &amp; family concerns<br/> offering the use of a house for

                            we found them compasing a settlement<br/> of about seventeen houses

<p>The Committee under whose care the concern relative to<br/> the
                            civilization &amp; welfare of the Indians is placed,<br/> continue to
                            feel interested in the work &amp; desirous of<br/> using every suitable
                            means to promote the object of<br/> their appointment.</p>
<p>Several of their number have made a visit to<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brothertown">Brothertown<orgname key="brothertown"></orgname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>
                            Tribes since<br/> last Year, by their report, we find, that at<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a> although divers of them
                            are very<br/> intemperate, yet there are many others &amp;
                            particularly<br/> amongst the younger class who refrain from
                            excessive<br/> drinking &amp; are making considerable advancement
                            in<br/> improving their lands, to which we believe the care<br/> &amp;
                            exertions of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John Dean<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a> &amp; family
                            have greatly<br/> contributed; his son teaches a School in that place<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_041" n="41"></pb>
<br/>which is expected to be continued and on a plan that<br/> appeared
                            likely to be more extensively useful</p>
<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> there are a number of
                            families who<br/> appear to be sober and industrious, provide
                            themselves<br/> comfortable houses &amp; accommodations &amp; have two
                            Schools<br/> taught by Indians.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> are divided into two
                            Companies, one of<br/> which are generally given to excessive drinking;
                            they have<br/> lately sold a considerable tract to Government &amp;
                            seem<br/> much unsettled &amp; inclined to remove to the Southward<br/>
                            where they can follow hunting their usual course<br/> of life;
                            consequently there appears but little prospect<br/> of doing much
                            advantageously for them. </p>
<p>The other part of the Tribe known by the name<br/> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneidss">Oneida South settlement<placename key="oneidss"></placename></a> very generally
                            abstain from<br/> the use of ardent Spirits, and with them in a
                            collective<br/> capacity the Committee had a very satisfactory
                            conference;<br/> the expressed great satisfaction in the care
                            extended<br/> towards them by friends &amp; an intention to follow
                            their<br/> advice. Although this Tribe have not made<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_042" n="42"></pb>
<br/>so much progress in the cultivation of the earth as some<br/>
                            others, yet from the disposition for improvement which<br/> they
                            manifest, we are encouraged to persevere in our<br/> attention towards
                            them; and a friend &amp; his wife,<br/> (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/rhatf1">Ruth

                            concerns, it was approved &amp; they are now<br/> settled there for that
                            purpose</p>
<p>The attention of the Committee has also been<br/> turned to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/montaukind">Indians<orgname key="montaukind"></orgname></a> on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/montauk">Montauk Point<placename key="montauk"></placename></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/longi">Long

                            to<br/> believe they are entitled to the further care of Friends.</p>
<p>The Committee have received a proportion of<br/> the liberal donation of
                            Friends in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> for the<br/>

                            which the want of Friends had<br/> hitherto prevented. </p>
<p>In closing this report we are willing to add that<br/> in our
                            deliberations on this interesting subject we have<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_043" n="43"></pb>
<br/>been encouraged by the consoling belief that the labor already<br/>

                            settlement<br/> twelve framed houses &amp; ten barns &amp; the

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John Dean's<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a>, we had an opportunity of
                            discovering<br/> their situation &amp; qualifications for usefulness
                            among<br/> this people, which produced a conviction on our<br/> minds
                            that they are an acquisition to them &amp; the<br/> Indians appear very
                            generally to consider them in<br/> the most favorable point of view. It
                            is with<br/> much satisfaction that we have it in our power to<br/>
                            state that the Superintendants place the fullest<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_047" n="47"></pb>

                            disposed to encourage the School in a way quite satisfactory<br/> as
                            also to grant to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John Dean<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a> the use of
                            as much<br/> cleared ground as he inclines to have, so that the<br/>
                            business respecting the School &amp; land is now clearly<br/>
                            understood, &amp; put in train to their satisfaction &amp;<br/> that of
                            the Superintendants; such other matters<br/> were attended to as we hope

<p>We then proceeded on our way to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a>, but<br/> were prevented getting there by
                            the state of the<br/> roads, we therefore bent our course for the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a><br/> to our friends

                            attended the council held<br/> next morning, in which we encouraged them
                            to<br/> sobriety &amp; industry, particularly the improvement of<br/>
                            their lands; we learn that this South Party who go<br/> under the
                            appellation of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/pagan">Pagans<orgname key="pagan"></orgname></a> are careful on
                            account<br/> of the use of Spirituous Liquors &amp; some of them
                            labour<br/> on the ground &amp; raise <del>corn</del> grain &amp; others
                            of them have<br/> more or less stock; but generally speaking as far
                            as<br/> we could discover they are still very improvident; <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_048" n="48"></pb><br/>their saw mill being damaged, they solcited some aid <br/>from us
                            to enable them to repair it; we told them <br/>friends were inclined to
                            assist their Indian Brethren <br/>when they found they were disposed to
                            labor and <br/>assist themselves, that if they would turn out strong
                            <br/>we might be will to lend them some assistance <br/>they could repay
                            us out of their annuity.</p>
<p>As far as we could discern the Indians seem <br/>to be well satisfied
                            with our friends <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> &amp;

                            situated near the Council <br/>Chamber &amp; now are in possesio of the

                                Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> near <br/>the Turnpike.We herewith annex an acct.
                            <br/>of the articles furnished Absalom for his own &amp; <br/>and the
                            use of the Indians, which also includes the <br/>85 25/100 pd to get
                            possession of the house; <br/>the whole amount being 449 55/100
                            Dollars.</p>
<p>As it is uncertain what accomodation the <br/>Indians will provide for a
                            Teacher &amp; Absalom <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_049" n="49"></pb><br/>&amp; Ruth are disposed to let
                            him have a part of <br/>their house provided friends are willing to have
                            <br/>some improvements made, which on consideration <br/>we hope will
                            leave us justified in authorizing <br/>Absalom to have done; the two
                            families residing <br/>together may be better on several accounts, for
                            the <br/>present at least. It appearing to us expedient <br/>that
                            Absalom should be furnished with a waggon <br/>&amp; another horse, we
                            encouraged hime to procure them.</p>
<p>At Oneida we met with two <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondgoes<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>
<br/>one of whom had been in New York in company <br/>with several more
                            of the same nation &amp; had had <br/>an interview with divers friends
                            there; they <br/>appeared very solicitous that we should make their
                            <br/>nation a visit &amp; on consideration we concluded to <br/>proceed
                            accordingly. On reaching this settlement <br/>which is about 33 miles
                            fomr Oneida, we had an <br/>opportunity with them, all of us siting on
                            the <br/>grass, which was tought more convenient than <br/>meeting in
                            the house. The Interpreter is a white <br/>
<br/>man who has resided in the neighbourhood of the <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_050" n="50"></pb><br/>Indians for many years &amp; at present lives in<br/> their
                            settlement, he having liberty to cultivate<br/> land for himself &amp;
                            his family; the Natives appear<br/> better cloathed than the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas,<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> they received us<br/> very
                            courteously &amp; we had a satisfactory time<br/> with them which was
                            greatly increased when we<br/> were informed not only by themselves but
                            the<br/> Interpreter, that they had totally refrained<br/> from the use
                            of ardent spirits for abt. nine<br/> years &amp; that none of the
                            natives will touch<br/> it; they spoke of the <del>Divers</del> Great
                            Spirit &amp; of<br/> its divers influence with as much perspicuity<br/>
                            as perhaps could be conveyed in any language<br/> their number consists
                            of One hundred &amp; sixty, men, women<br/> &amp; children; they possess
                            about twelve thousand acres of<br/> land &amp; after they were
                            recommended to labor more<br/> on the ground, they signified they were
                            willing so to<br/> do, but never having been much taught &amp; not
                            having<br/> the necessary implements to work with, they have<br/> not
                            been able to make any great advance therein;<br/> they informed us that
                            they had received some<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_051" n="51"></pb>
<br/>encouragement from friends of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> of being <br/> furnished with the means of
                            cultivating their lands, &amp; <br/>when they found the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> were assisted they expected<br/> we
                            would extend our kindness towards them</p>
<p>What is worthy of remark as relates to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagas<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a><br/> is, that they were formerly as noted for
                            their savage<br/> manners &amp; great intemperance as they are now
                            for<br/> their gentleness &amp; sobriety of conduct; the
                            Interpreter<br/> informed us, they had been universally, men &amp;
                            women<br/> given up to the excessive use of strong drink, so that<br/>
                            all prospect of civilizing them appeared to be impractica<br/>ble: this
                            great change affords rational grounds<br/> for encouragement, that the
                            endeavors of friends to<br/> promote the welfare of this people may be
                            attended<br/> with success</p>
<p>As way did not open to pay a visit to the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribe &amp; having met
                            with several of their<br/> women on the road, it was concluded that it
                            might<br/> afford relief to th minds of our two women friends<br/> for
                            them to send an address to their females, one<br/> was accordingly
                            prepared &amp; sent<br/>

                            and security being manifest amongst them<br/> to which we believe the

                            present time for the purpose of<br/> mitigating the extreme sufferings
                            of these poor<br/> creatures for the want of bread occasioned by
                            the<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_064" n="64"></pb> general failure of their crops. A
                            permanent<br/> Teacher for this Tribe has not yet been procured<br/>
                            which still remains to be a desirable object with the<br/> Committee. At

<p>The Friends appointed to visit the Indians on the<br/> Eastern part of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/longi">Long Island,<placename key="longi"></placename></a> made the following report,</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>Four of the Committee have visited the Indians on<br/> the Eastern parts
                            of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/longi">Long Island<placename key="longi"></placename></a>, and found them

                            visited them in <date when="1808-10">10th Mo 1808</date></p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/montaukind">Those<orgname key="montaukind"></orgname></a> on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/montauk">Montauk<placename key="montauk"></placename></a> have plenty of good land to improve, &amp;<br/>
                            other priviledges, so that with industry &amp; economy they<br/> might
                            subsist very comfortably.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/shin">Shinicock<orgname key="shin"></orgname></a> Tribe<br/> near the Canoe
                            Place not so well circumstanced, their<br/> land being not so good &amp;
                            more under restrictions from<br/> the white people. At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/montauk">Montauk<placename key="montauk"></placename></a> they have a pretty<br/> good
                            school house, &amp; sometimes have a School therein;<br/> they also
                            occupy it for a Meeting place. At the<br/> Canoe place they have a
                            Meeting House now in <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_069" n="69"></pb>
<br/>tolerable repair &amp; hold Meetings; they are professors with<br/>
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/presby">Presbyterians.<orgname key="presby"></orgname></a> We also visited a few
                            families<br/> farther westward; they are settled on a small tract
                            of<br/> land called <placename>Poas-paddock</placename>, near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wfloy1">Col. Floyd's<persname key="wfloy1"></persname></a>; they<br/> occupy the land for
                            tillage, but we did not find they<br/> had any right to pasture or get
                            fire wood upon it.</p>
<p>They are generally wanting in industry and economy,<br/> and many of them
                            too much addicted to strong drink, yet<br/> we were in hopes there was a
                            little improvement amongst<br/> them. At each place they appeared glad
                            of our<br/> visit &amp; expressed gratitude for the attention of
                            Friends<br/> towards them. and upon the whole we had a good<br/> degree
                            of satisfaction in performing the service.<br/> Signed on behalf of the
                            Committee<br/>

<p>The care &amp; attention of the Committee in performing<br/> the visit was
                    satisfactory &amp; as they informed that they<br/> had distributed some articles
                    amongst the Indians,<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_070" n="70"></pb> but were not prepared with the account,
                    they were<br/> directed to produce it at our next Meeting;<br/> the further
                    consideration of the situation of these<br/> Tribes was referred to our next
                    Meeting</p>
<p>The Committee to make a visit to the Western tribes<br/> were not prepared to
                    report the performance of the<br/> service confided to them; but information
                    being given<br/> that one of said Committee &amp; one of the General<br/>

                    inspected into<br/> the state of things amongst them, the attention of the<br/>
                    Committee was turned to the consideration thereof, and<br/> it appearing much to
                    our satisfacion that considerable<br/> advancement had been made by the Indians
                    during<br/> the last year in the cultivation of their lands &amp; that<br/> they
                    had a prospect of good crops; &amp; in order to<br/> encourage and assist them
                    therein it was concluded<br/> that an additional number of Oxen, as well as<br/>
                    implements of husbandry, such as ploughs, chains &amp;c. <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_071" n="71"></pb>
<br/>should be procured &amp; placed in the hands of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom  Hatfield<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> for the use of the Indians, the

                    should<br/> think requisite. And as it appeared by inform<br/>ation from the
                    friends above mentioned, that<br/> considerable uneasiness exists amongst the

                    into their settlement, which in the<br/> division of the reservation had become
                    the property<br/> of Indians of the other part, and by them sold<br/> as they
                    understand to the State, from an apprehension<br/> that the land may be sold to
                    &amp; settled by white<br/> people to their great injury; in that they
                    solicited<br/> the care of Friends for their relief; the subject<br/> was

                            strengthen you in it.</p>
<p>Brothers<br/> We are glad you have got your eyes<br/> open to see what is
                            good for you, and that is is right<br/> and honorable to cultivate the
                            earth, so that you<br/> and your families may live comfortably.</p>
<p>Sisters<br/> We want you to help forward this good<br/> work, not only by
                            encouraging the men to be sober<br/> and industrious, but by being so
                            yourselves, doing<br/> your part of the business by learning to spin,
                            weave,<br/> make clothing for yourselves and families, and<br/> keeping
                            your houses and all around you neat<br/> and clean.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters-<br/> we wish you would be<br/> careful to bring up
                            your Children well, teach them to<br/><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_080" n="80"></pb> hearken to what the
                            Good Spirit says in their<br/> hearts, to love one another, to be
                            industrious, the<br/> sons to help their fathers plow, hoe and raise
                            grain,<br/> and the daughters to assist their mothers in things
                            about<br/> the house such as spinning, weaving, sewing &amp;
                            keeping<br/> all clean &amp; in good order, so that when old age
                            comes<br/> upon the Fathers and Mothers, the Children by<br/> their
                            industry and good conduct may make them<br/> comfortable by their
                            firesides. As we want to encourage<br/> you in your good resolutions, we
                            have desired<br/> our friends <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/alaph1">Abraham

<p>The Committee to visit the Western Tribes made<br/> the following report viz</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>In the course of the Tenth month several<br/> numbers of the Committee
                            visited the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a><br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondaga<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> Tribes, and<br/> have the following particular
                            to state</p>
<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a> we had an opportunity
                            with a<br/> number of the most sober part to some satisfaction,<br/> but
                            viewing them as a Tribe they appear to have<br/> rather declined, and as
                            considerable has been done<br/> for them to little effect, we apprehend
                            it might be<br/> best for Friends to withold all pecuniary aid from<br/>
                            them for a season, as they have the mean of<br/> living quite
                            comfortably, if they will only make<br/> good use of them.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> they do not appear to
                            have<br/> improved much of late, many of them being not<br/> only idle
                            and neglectful of business, but given to <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_089" n="89"></pb><br/>drinking and
                            excess, yet they have some sober<br/> persons of both sexes still among
                            them, who recieved<br/> us very cordially</p>
<p>Things wear a different appearance at<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>; in walking about their
                            settlements we were<br/> pleased to see their improvements in
                            agriculture;<br/> they appeared to have plenty of grain for their
                            own<br/> use, many new Cribs full of corn, and have<br/> sowed
                            considerable wheat and put it in good<br/> fence. </p>
<p>We had two conferences with them in which<br/> the Chief objects they had
                            in view seemed the<br/> establishment of a School to be taught by a
                            member<br/> of our Society, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/rhatf1">Ruth

                            to<br/> teach some of the Women to spin, sow &amp; knit,<br/> we
                            encouraged them &amp; ordered some spinning<br/> wheels &amp; flax
                            purchased for their use, that it<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_090" n="90"></pb>
<br/>might be going on till way opens for some one else<br/> to
                            undertake it, or if they should prove qualified for<br/> the
                            undertaking, we have thought it might answer<br/> to employ some other
                            friends to attend to the farming<br/> and general concerns, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom's<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> health being so<br/> much impaired
                            there is no probability of his being<br/> able to answer the purpose
                            another year; and if<br/> a farmer is continued amongst them, it will
                            be<br/> necessary to provide one to take his place in the<br/> Spring;
                            and to be of much use to them in that line,<br/> he ought besides other
                            qualifications to be a thorough<br/> smartman. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondaga Tribe<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> appear to be an
                            industrious<br/> sober people, having but little intercourse with
                            the<br/> white people around them, placing no confidence in<br/> any but
                            Friends. We think the way is quite open<br/> and an encouraging prospect
                            of Friends being useful<br/> to them provided a suitable family could be
                            got to<br/> settle near them a convenient place for the <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_091" n="91"></pb><br/>purpose, joining their lands on the north side,<br/> containing
                            200 acres, under some improvement<br/> is now offered for sale, and is
                            thought may be had<br/> low, perhaps 9 or 10 Dolls per arce we
                            found<br/> them engaged generally in gathering their corn; they<br/>
                            appeared to have plenty for their own consumption<br/> and some to spare
                            for other necessaries. They are<br/> getting in the way of raising
                            wheat, potatoes and<br/> pumpkins, and are desirous of further
                            instruction<br/> and assistance The two pair of Oxen Friends<br/>
                            provided them with, as well as those at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida,<placename key="oneid"></placename></a><br/> we left in charge with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jfros1">Joseph Frost<persname key="jfros1"></persname></a> to sell them if<br/> he can, if

                    that purpose; on consideration <br/>it was concluded to furnish them on<br/>
                    loan with four small wheels and one large wheel<br/> some wool cards, some wool,
                    flax and flaxseed, to the<br/> amount altogether of 30 to 40 Dolls; the Clerk

                    would be<br/> proper for friends to purchase in order to place on<br/> it a
                    suitable person to attend to the instruction of<br/> the Indians; the Clerk is

<p>The Committee on the concern relative to the civilization<br/> and

                            effect the design of their appointment<br/> they have been comforted in
                            a belief, that the situation<br/> of many of the Indians has been made
                            more<br/> comfortable by their improvements in agriculture &amp;<br/> by
                            an increased care among them in avoiding the<br/> intemperate use of
                            Spirituous Liquors At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a><br/> a
                            number have made considerable advancement in<br/> farming. They
                            generally had plenty of corn for<br/> their own use, and considerable
                            wheat in the ground<br/> inclosed with good fence; a school has been
                            kept<br/> up during the last six months by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> &amp;<br/>

                            attended, and<br/> many of them made tolerable good progress in
                            learning:<br/> the Indians having expressed a desire to be taught<br/>
                            spinning, knitting &amp; weaving, the Committee directed <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_104" n="104"></pb>
<br/>wheels, flax &amp; a loom to be purchased, and several<br/> of
                            their young women have already made considerable<br/> progress in
                            learning to spin and knit; they appear<br/> much pleased with this
                            additional care of Friends</p>
<p>To instruct them in these branches, the Committee<br/> conceive to be
                            very important, as it is reasonable to<br/> believe, that as the women
                            advance in this kind of<br/> industry, and contribute so much to the
                            comfort<br/> of their families, their influence with the men will<br/>
                            be increased, their condition ameliorated, and they<br/> relieved from
                            out door work; and that the men<br/> will be encouraged to attend more
                            readily to agricultural<br/> pursuits The Committee have been desirous
                            of<br/> engaging a suitable friend to reside at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a> in<br/> addition to the friends who are now
                            there in order<br/> to instruct the Indians in agriculture, but
                            have<br/> not as yet been able to procure one. Several of<br/> the
                            Tribes have been visited by Committees appointed<br/> for that purpose

<p>Some of those of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a> are very
                            industrious<br/> &amp; improving in agriculture, but in general they
                            have<br/> not made that improvement that might have been<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_108" n="108"></pb>
<br/>expected, considering the attention that has been paid them;<br/>
                            many of them continue in the habit of drinking to excess,
                            whereby<br/>the necessary attention to the improvement of their land
                            is<br/> neglected</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> nation we think have
                            made considerable<br/> advancement in improving their lands and raising
                            grain &amp;<br/> divers of them have raised some flax this season,
                            encouraged <br/>thereto by their young women's learning to spin in
                            consequence<br/> of being furnished by the Committee with wheels, flax,
                            wool<br/> &amp; On their receiving these a general Council was
                            called<br/> to consult on the method to be pursued in teaching
                            their<br/> girls the use of them, and they unitedly agreed that a<br/>
                            school should be established for the purpose, and that<br/> one of the
                            Young Women educated in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>
                            should<br/> teach it, and some of their principal women superintend<br/>
                            the business; and we find it has been conducted with<br/> regularity
                            &amp; harmony. On our going into the School<br/> room, we found 38
                            bunches of yarn hanging in regular<br/> order, under the names of 38
                            girls &amp; women who had<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_109" n="109"></pb>
<br/>spun it, and most of it was better done, than we had a<br/> right
                            to expect Their women are much pleased with<br/> the prospect of their
                            daughter being taught to make them<br/> clothing, and some of the men
                            seem encouraged to turn<br/> their attention to raise sheep as well as
                            flax for the<br/> purpose. But too many here as well as at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a><br/> give way to excessive
                            drinking, by which means very<br/> little improvement of the farms of
                            these appears</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> have of latter time made
                            greater<br/> improvement in agriculture than the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> nation,<br/> they raise
                            wheat as well as plenty of Corn, we were<br/> informed they last year
                            sowed about 100 bushels of wheat,<br/> but not quite so much this year,
                            they have 15 yoke of<br/> Oxen of their own &amp; a number of Cows &amp;
                            horses<br/> And a number of the girls &amp; women have been taught<br/>

                            this nation<br/> also seem much pleased. We find <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom Hatfield<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a><br/> health is such as to render him
                            incapable of<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_110" n="110"></pb>
<br/>attending to the most necessary part of the business for<br/> which

                            industrious &amp;<br/> have improved their lands for the time they
                            have<br/> turned their attention to it, more than either of the<br/>
                            other nations &amp; seem very grateful for the aid &amp;
                            encourage<br/>ment Friends have afforded them.</p>
<p>We think there is a prospect of much advantage<br/> resulting from their
                            women in each nation being taught<br/> &amp; encouraged in making their
                            own cloathing; the women<br/> thereby will find more employment in the
                            house, while<br/> the men it is to be hoped will be induced to
                            cultivate<br/> the land &amp; afford the materials for their cloathing </p>

                            order to obtain such knowledge of their cir<br/>cumstances and situation
                            as might enable them to<br/> decide on the steps proper to be taken to
                            carry into effect<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_117" n="117"></pb>
<br/>the views of the Yearly Meeting; the Committee performed<br/> the
                            service, and on their return reported as follows;</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>Agreeably to our appointment we have made a <br/> visit to most
                                    of the Indian Nations on the frontier of this<br/> State. We
                                    first visited those settled at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>, which<br/> is about one hundred
                                    and twenty miles northwest of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>;<br/> they consist of about 35 families,
                                    being parts of several<br/> tribes from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newlon">New London<placename key="newlon"></placename></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/narra">Narraganset<placename key="narra"></placename></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/longi">Long
                                        Island<placename key="longi"></placename></a>, <br/>and have some knowledge of the
                                    English language, habits<br/> and manners; some of them can read
                                    and write, and all progress<br/> a belief in Christianity. They
                                    possess about 10,000 acres of<br/> very fair land, given them by
                                    the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida Tribe<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, which is<br/>
                                    laid out in farms of 50 to 150 acres to a family: a<br/> number
                                    of them appear to be desirous of religious improvement,<br/> and
                                    frequently meet together on the first day of the week<br/> for
                                    the purpose of religious instruction, and employ the time<br/>
                                    in reading and exhortation</p>
<p>From <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a> we proceeded
                                    to a<br/> settlement made by the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribe, about 15 miles<br/> further
                                    west and within 5 miles of the principal town<br/> of the
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, who gave them the
                                    tract on which they<br/> are now settled, containing six miles
                                    square of excellent<br/> land; they removed from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/mass">Massachusetts<placename key="mass"></placename></a> to this place<br/>
                                    about 10 years since.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Indians are
                                    generally<br/> unacquainted with the English language, and
                                    retain<br/> their native dress and manners; some of them
                                    have<br/> separate farms, but they are very indifferently
                                    tilled, as<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_118" n="118"></pb>
<br/>many of them are idle and indisposed to the cultivation
                                    of<br/> their land, which must in great measure be attributed
                                    to<br/> their former habits of life in hunting &amp;c. This<br/>
                                    nation consists of about 60 families; they were
                                    <del>about</del><br/> endeavouring to get a saw mill erected,
                                    but not having<br/> funds to complete it, we furnished them with
                                    pecuniary<br/> aid. We had much satisfaction in a Council
                                    with<br/> the men and women of this tribe, one of them on
                                    behalf<br/> the rest expressed their sorrow that the great evil
                                    of drinking<br/> Spirituous Liquors had so much prevailed
                                    amongst his<br/> nation and Western Brothers, which had blinded
                                    many, <br/>and prevented their following the advice of the
                                    Friends<br/> as they had been used to do; for which he was very
                                    sorry, as<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>
                                    had long experienced the kindness of<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> and his Children,
                                    but hoped we would<br/> not be too much discouraged with
                                    them.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> we went to
                                    the principal<br/> settlement of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>; this nation resided where<br/> they now
                                    are when the Country was first known to the<br/> white people;
                                    it now consists of about 150 families, and<br/> altho' they
                                    possess 24 miles square of excellent land,<br/> they have made
                                    but little agricultural improvement<br/> or advancement in
                                    civilized life, being like the<br/> other Tribes addicted to the
                                    excessive use of ardent spirits;<br/> they are mostly very idle,
                                    and the little labour which<br/> is done is commonly performed
                                    by the women.<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_119" n="119"></pb></p>
<p>We had a prospect of preceeding from the place to<br/> visit the
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagoes<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>, a Tribe
                                    resident about 35 miles<br/> further west; this prospect however
                                    we relinquished on<br/> learning that they were the most
                                    uncivilized of any of<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/sxntns">Six
                                        Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, and lived in habitual intoxication;<br/>
                                    and that they were generally at that time in a state<br/> of
                                    drunkenness, having recently received their annuity from<br/>
                                    the Government, which had induced white Traders to<br/> carry
                                    Spirituous Liquors amongst them; but as there<br/> were a few
                                    sober sensible men in the Tribe, we sent<br/> an address to
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cjohn1">Capt John<persname key="cjohn1"></persname></a>, one of their
                                    Cheifs expressive<br/> of the nature of the Societys concern and
                                    our solicitude<br/> for their welfare.</p>
<p>We had often to lament the strong<br/> attachment of the Indians
                                    to Spirituous Liquors<br/> which is the principal obstacle to
                                    their civilization<br/> and agricultural improvement, and we
                                    consider it<br/> of the utmost importance to prevent by every
                                    possible<br/> means the introduction of this article amongst
                                    them.<br/> And it is our decided opinion that it would tend<br/>
                                    greatly to their advantage could they be prevailed<br/> on to
                                    have farms allotted to each family, in order<br/> that they may
                                    have some idea of separate property,<br/> which would be likely
                                    to produce habits of industry,<br/> and induce them more
                                    generally to till the ground for<br/> their support.</p>
<p>The Yearly Meeting on being possessed<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_120" n="120"></pb>
<br/>of the information contained in the preceding
                                    statement<br/> placed the subject under the care of a Special
                                    Com<br/>mittee, with instructions to take such steps as
                                    should<br/> appear to them best calculated to carry into effect
                                    the concern<br/> of the Yearly Meeting for ameliorating the
                                    condition of this part of the<br/>human family. The objects
                                    claiming the attention<br/> of the Committee have been to
                                    impress on the minds of the<br/> Indians such a knowledge of the
                                    Supreme Being and of the<br/> teachings of his Grace as they
                                    appeared to be capable of<br/> receiving to dissuade them from
                                    the use of ardent spirits;<br/> to encourage habits of industry
                                    in the cultivation of their<br/> lands; to give them a knowledge
                                    of some of the most<br/> useful mechanic arts, and to afford
                                    instruction to their <br/>children in School learning; with
                                    these views frequent<br/> visits have been made them, and
                                    working Cattle and<br/> many implements of husbandry have been
                                    from time<br/> to time furnished them and assistance rendered
                                    in<br/> building grist and saw mills. In order to<br/>
                                    facilitate their agricultural pursuits and general<br/>
                                    improvement, it was deemed proper to place families<br/> in some
                                    of the Tribes, and several families of Friends<br/> being so
                                    much interested in the welfare of the Indians<br/> as to be
                                    willing to reside amongst them, were settled<br/>
                                    accordingly.</p>
<p>By the reports of the Friends appointed<br/> from time to time to
                                    visit the different Tribes, it appears,<br/> that although
                                    considerable endeavours have been used<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_121" n="121"></pb>
<br/>to promote the improvement of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> and<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a> Tribes, and a
                                    family of Friends has resided<br/> several years at the latter
                                    place, and applied themselves<br/> with diligence to the service
                                    for which they were selected;<br/> these Tribes have not
                                    improved equally with the others,<br/> considering their
                                    previous progress, the care which has<br/> been extended to
                                    them, and the time that has elapsed<br/> since it was first
                                    exercised; principally owing to the<br/> vicinity of white
                                    inhabitants, and the consequent fa<br/>cility of procuring
                                    Spirituous Liquors; they have<br/> however made considerable
                                    progress in agriculture,<br/> and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Women have latterly taken<br/> much
                                    interest in a Spinnng School established amongst<br/> them and
                                    made rapid progress in that branch of industry<br/> so useful to
                                    them, and so important to their advancement<br/> in civilized
                                    life; and hopes are cherished that be<br/>nificial effects will
                                    result to the Indian Youth,<br/> from the Schools which have
                                    been for a long time kept<br/> up in these Tribes.</p>
<p>During the time that our attention was<br/> principally confined
                                    to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a> &amp;

                                    Tribes, the Friends of the Yearly Meeting of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, had given
                                    considerable aid to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>
                                    Tribe<br/> and several Friends interested in their welfare
                                    had<br/> resided amongst them for the purpose of promoting
                                    their<br/> agricultural and general improvement, but after <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_122" n="122"></pb>
<br/>considerable exertions for their benefit the friends of
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> found
                                    it expedient to withdraw their care<br/> and attention; the
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> afterwards expressed
                                    renewed<br/> desires for Friends' assistance, and as they were
                                    more<br/> immediately in our neighbourhood, and the Friends<br/>
                                    of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> had extended

                                    appeared proper that we<br/> should inspect into their
                                    situation. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Tribe<br/>
                                    afterwards formed themselves into two parties and made a
                                    <br/>division of their land; one was called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/chris">Christian Party<orgname key="chris"></orgname></a>,<br/> in consequence
                                    of their having attached themselves to a<br/> Missionary who had
                                    for a long time resided in the Tribe,<br/> and the other was
                                    called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/pagan">Pagan Party<orgname key="pagan"></orgname></a>; and as
                                    there<br/> appeared to be the greatest probability of our being
                                    useful<br/> to the latter, from their being particularly<br/>
                                    desirous of our<br/> assistance, a family of Friends was placed
                                    there whose<br/> counsel and attention have been very useful to
                                    the Indians<br/> A School for the instruction of their Youth was
                                    some time<br/> since opened and latterly extended to promote the
                                    im<br/>provement of their females in spinning; the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>
<br/>have become much interested in the cultivation of
                                    their<br/> land, and their improvements in husbandry, and
                                    increas<br/>ingly sober habits have given peculiar
                                    satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Committee have recently felt much<br/> interested for the
                                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagoe<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> Tribe, who
                                    having for<br/> some years past relinquished the use of ardent
                                    spirits,<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_123" n="123"></pb>
<br/>and become sober and industrious, requested the
                                    assistance<br/> of Friends; they have accordingly been supplied
                                    with<br/> Oxen and farming utensils, and their agricultural<br/>
                                    improvement and advancement in civilization have been<br/> the
                                    most rapid of any of the Tribes.</p>
<p>Experience has proved that it is most bene<br/>ficial to the
                                    Indians to be furnished with pecuniary aid<br/> in such manner
                                    as may tend to develop and call into<br/> exercise their own
                                    resources, lest they indulge the disposition<br/> of depending
                                    upon Friends for regular and stated assistance,<br/> which would
                                    eventually prove injurious to them; it has<br/> therefore been
                                    deemed most advisable that the application<br/> of our funds
                                    should be made productive of their agri<br/>cultural improvement
                                    by procuring them the necessary<br/> means to facilitate labour.
                                    And it is but justice<br/> to observe that the liberality of our
                                    Brethren in<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> has been sensibly
                                    felt, as thereby the Com<br/>mittee has been enabled to extend
                                    its views and<br/> enlarge the sphere of its usefulness to this
                                    People.</p>
<p>The annexed statistical account will further<br/> elucidate the
                                    present situation of the different Tribes<br/> under the care of

<p>We have heard from your Council<br/> fire once more; we have
                                    heard that you wanted to know<br/> whether the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagoes<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> had left off the use of
                                    strong<br/> drink, or not. Brothers, we have left off a
                                    long<br/> time ago- you told us leave off- the Great Spirit
                                    told<br/> us to leave off: we have listened to His voice.</p>
<p>There are some that visit us from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> that<br/> drink, we think they will leave
                                    off by our good advice.</p>
<p>Brothers, we are in want of Cattle, chains,<br/> ploughs, and all
                                    kinds of farming utensils; you have told<br/> us that you would
                                    help us; we were glad to hear you<br/> were willing to help us. </p>
<p>Brothers, we are in want of blacksmiths,<br/> carpenters, and
                                    other mechanics; we want to learn our<br/> children to work; we
                                    have opened our eyes, we now<br/> see that we must work; we are
                                    willing to work; we<br/> begin to raise wheat, and will do more

                                    the Good Spirit says in their hearts, to<br/> love one another,

<p>The Committee on the Concern for the<br/> civilization &amp; welfare of
                            the Indians<br/> Having given attention to the object of the<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_133" n="133"></pb>
<br/>concern; the Tribes under our care have been<br/> visited by some
                            of our number, and such attention<br/> and assistance afforded them as
                            appeared to be<br/> necessary. Having in former reports stated the<br/>
                            particular circumstances of the different Tribes, we do<br/> not at this
                            time judge it necessary to repeat the same,<br/> except that in addition
                            to our encouraging them in<br/> the cultivation of their land, we have
                            suggested to<br/> them the advantages that would probably result
                            from<br/> their women's learning to spin and weave to provide<br/>
                            themselves with cloathing. In order to encourage<br/> them in this very
                            useful undertaking, we have<br/> furnished some of the Tribes with flax
                            &amp; wool &amp; <br/>a number of wheels to make a beginning which<br/>
                            has succeeded beyond our expectation, and been a<br/> means of inducing
                            some of them to raise these<br/> articles for themselves </p>

<opener>We of the Committee appointed to visit the several<br/> tribes of

                            report</opener>
<p>That we first visited the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown
                                Tribe<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a><br/> had a satisfactory opportunity with them
                            collectively<br/> and also called at a number of their families,
                            and<br/> on inspecting their situation it appears, that in<br/>
                            consequences of the attention of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdean1">John<persname key="jdean1"></persname></a>
                            &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tdean1">Thomas Dean<persname key="tdean1"></persname></a>,<br/> we apprehend
                            no assistance at present necessary;<br/> but as they have a prospect of
                            removing from<br/> thence we think the care of the Committee will
                            still<br/> be requisite</p>
<p>Having inspected the situation of the Tribe<br/> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newst">New Stockbridge<placename key="newst"></placename></a>, we have not discovered
                            much<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_136" n="136"></pb>
<br/>improvement in agriculture, many of the men being<br/> given to
                            intemperance &amp; indolence, which evil we<br/> believe has been
                            greatly increased by the introduction<br/> of white people living among
                            them: they have also been<br/> induced to let out their Farms to these
                            people on<br/> conditions unprofitable to themselves, thereby
                            depending<br/> on their labor; but as arrangements are made by<br/>
                            Government for removing the white inhabitants, we<br/> encouraged them
                            to improve the land by their own<br/> labor, and had the satisfaction to
                            Observe that<br/> a number manifested a disposition to adhere thereto </p>
<p>The introduction of a spinning School amongst them<br/> appears to have
                            stimulated a number of their women<br/> to progress in that art; some of
                            them having<br/> proceeded to make cloth for their own use; and<br/> we
                            thought it right to furnish them with more<br/> wool, flax and some
                            wheels, that the school may<br/> be continued to advantage Some of the
                            men have<br/> been induced to commence raising flax; that the<br/>
                            continuance of this business affords a prospect of<br/> usefuness to
                            that people, and we believe if persevered<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_137" n="137"></pb>
<br/>in, will gradually promote habits of industry<br/> more generally
                            amongst them</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneidss">South settlement<placename key="oneidss"></placename></a> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida Tribe<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a><br/> appears to be gradually
                            improving in the arts<br/> of agriculture, tho' here as in other Tribes
                            there<br/> remains much room for advancement; some<br/> of them we are
                            informed have refrained from the<br/> use of ardent Spirits for a number
                            of years, others<br/> have remained more or less intemperate; but<br/>
                            owing to the coincidence of several affecting<br/> circumstances, they
                            had lately convened in Council<br/> and as we were informed, unitedly
                            agreed to<br/> refrain enirely in future from the use of<br/> Ardent
                            Spirits; we pressingly enjoined them<br/> to maintain this resolution,
                            which they solemnly<br/> promised faithfully observe. We encouraged<br/>
                            their women to continue the arts of spinning,<br/> knitting &amp; and
                            they uniting therewith, we<br/> thought some further aid in furnishing
                            some<br/> Wool, flax and some wheels would be necessary;<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_138" n="138"></pb>
<br/>one of their own Tribe appears willing to take<br/> charge of a
                            School for instructing others in these<br/> arts; and we directed some
                            materials to be<br/> procured accordingly The oxen &amp; farming<br/>
                            utensils heretofore furnished to this Tribe appear<br/> to have been
                            useful, and for which they expressed<br/> their gratitude: on enquiry we
                            understood they were<br/> still in good repair, and likely to last the
                            present<br/> season; but finding that they stood in need of a<br/> few
                            more Carpenter's tools, we directed them procured<br/> in order as they
                            stated to accommodate them<br/> in building their houses and barns,
                            making their<br/> own ploughs</p>

<br/>progressing in agricultural improvements, having<br/> lately
                            commenced the raising other kinds of grain,<br/> besides Indian Corn,
                            which a few years past<br/> was the only kind raised amongst them, and
                            in<br/> which they are still increasing; yet in finding<br/> their
                            necessity of further instruction in preserving<br/> their stalks for the
                            benefit of wintering their Cattle;<br/> as well as in some other parts
                            of their business,<br/> we requested <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ewebs1">Ephrain
                                Webster<persname key="ewebs1"></persname></a> their interpreter<br/> to afford them some
                            assistance therein the present<br/> season; he being much interested in
                            their welfare,<br/> is disposed to do all he reasonably can for
                            them,<br/> and on moderate terms. They manifested their<br/> gratitude
                            for the attention and assistance of<br/> Friends; and it appearing that
                            the farming utensils<br/> heretofore furnished were much worn, we
                            concluded<br/> to procure two ploughs, chains and several kinds<br/> of
                            tools for their use; they are desirous that one<br/> or more of their
                            young men should learn the<br/> blacksmith' trade, provided a smith can
                            be<br/> procured to reside amongst them. We encouraged<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_140" n="140"></pb>
<br/>the men to persevere in the cultivation of their<br/> lands; and
                            also suggested the propriety of their<br/> women learning the arts of
                            spinning, knitting &amp;<br/> after some time spent in deliberating on
                            the subject,<br/> they requested time for further consideration in<br/>
                            order unitedly to decide thereon</p>
<p>In taking into view the situation of the<br/> different Tribes, we
                            believe there is cause of<br/> encouragement for further exertions of
                            Friends<br/> and as <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahatf1">Absalom<persname key="ahatf1"></persname></a> &amp;

                            from<br/> their station, we think it right to suggest to the<br/>
                            Committee the propriety of hiring a man to labor<br/> alternately with
                            the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribes<br/> through the

                            of<br/> his time amongst them, by which means an<br/> opportunity would

<opener>To the Yearly Meeting</opener>
<p>The Committee appointed on the concern for<br/> the civilization &amp;
                            welfare of the Indians having<br/> given attention to the subject report
                            that the<br/> different Tribes under our care have been visited<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_145" n="145"></pb>
<br/>by some of our number, and such attention &amp;<br/> assistance
                            afforded them as appeared necessary</p>
<p>As former reports have detailed particular<br/> circumstances relative to
                            the Tribes, we judge it<br/> not requisite to be very minute, but in
                            general<br/> to state. At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>

                            as<br/> they have a prospect of removing from thence<br/> we think the
                            care of Friends may still be useful.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newst">New Stockbridge<placename key="newst"></placename></a> in consequence of
                            the<br/> residence of white people among them they have<br/> been led to
                            neglect the cultivation of their lands<br/> but as arrangements are made
                            by Government<br/> to remove the white people, we are encouraged<br/> to
                            hope they will in that case become necessarily<br/> more industrious A
                            number of their women<br/> since the introduction of a spinning
                            School<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_146" n="146"></pb>
<br/>have progressed in that art, and they have proceed<br/>ed to make

                            introduced some of the men<br/> to commence raising flax: we think that
                            the<br/> continuance of this business affords a prospect<br/> of
                            usefulness to that people; and we believe if<br/> persevered in will
                            gradually promote habits<br/> of industry more generally amongst
                            them.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneidss">South settlement<placename key="oneidss"></placename></a> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Tribe<br/> appears to have been
                            gradually improving in<br/> agriculture; some of this Tribe for a
                            number<br/> of years have refrained from ardent spirits;<br/> they last
                            summer convened in council and unitedly<br/> agreed to refrain entirely
                            in future from the<br/> use of it. One of their women appears
                            willing<br/> to take charge of a spinning &amp; knitting school,<br/> on
                            materials being furnished them for the<br/> purpose, which the Committee
                            has directed to be<br/> procured.<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_147" n="147"></pb>
<br/>From the general temperance of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondago<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>
<br/>Tribe, &amp; their increasing industry in having<br/> raised
                            various kinds of grain &amp; we feel encouraged<br/> to hope that the
                            labor and care of Friends<br/> extended to them has not been
                            unavailing:<br/> they with the other Tribes have manifested<br/>
                            gratitude for the attention &amp; assistance afforded<br/> them. </p>
<p>Since the Committee performed their visit<br/> to the different Tribes,
                            information has been<br/> received, that through the influence of the
                            white<br/> people, nearly all the men, except the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/brothertown">Brothertown<orgname key="brothertown"></orgname></a> Tribe, have been
                            induced to go into the<br/> war, but that they returned in a few
                            weeks<br/> to their dwellings, &amp; resumed their former<br/> pursuits,
                            but we are apprehensive that the<br/> examples of intemperance &amp;
                            vice exhibited to<br/> their view during their absence will have a<br/>
                            tendency to retard their improvement in<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_148" n="148"></pb>

<p>The Committee to visit the Tribes under<br/> our care made the following
                    report<br/> We of the Committee appointed to visit<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_150" n="150"></pb>
<br/>the Indians report </p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>That we have made a visit to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneidss">Oneida South
                                Settlement<placename key="oneidss"></placename></a> &amp; had a conference with their Chiefs
                            &amp;<br/> principal men on such subjects as required attention. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding that part of the Tribe have been<br/>so far misled as to
                            go into the war, yet the injury<br/> they have sustained is apparently
                            less than might<br/> have been expected, their improvements in
                            agriculture<br/> continue, and intemperance does not seem to have<br/>
                            gained ground amongst them, some of their elder<br/> men give way to
                            this vice, but we are informed that<br/> their women and most of their
                            young men are<br/> free from it <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wruth1">William

                            school &amp; from twenty to thirty scholars<br/> attend &amp; the number
                            is likely to increase we<br/> have agreed that he shall have a
                            compensation<br/> at the rate of $250 per ann &amp; board himself, till
                            the <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_151" n="151"></pb>
<br/>General Committee shall resulut on the subject.</p>
<p>On conferring with a number of the women<br/> who are much interested in
                            learning to spin we<br/> concluded to supply them with two pounds of
                            wool<br/> &amp; six pounds of flax each; there are about Twenty<br/>
                            four who are learning, and as more wheels are<br/> needed we concluded
                            to furnish them with one great<br/> &amp; one small wheel, &amp; a loom
                            which they were<br/> very desirous of having; as one of their
                            number<br/> has learned to weave </p>
<p>We proceeded to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> &amp; had
                            a conference<br/> in the Meeting House with such of the Tribe as<br/>
                            could be collected They like the other Tribes have<br/> unhappily taken
                            part in the war, and their<br/> habits of intemperance as might be
                            expected are<br/> not lessened; their women have made great<br/>
                            advancement in spinning, about sixty have<br/> learned in a greater or
                            less degree, and in order<br/> to encourage them in it, we concluded to
                            furnish<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_152" n="152"></pb>
<br/>them with there more great &amp; thence more small<br/> wheels, and
                            in order that they might be led to<br/> future exertion by reaping some
                            benefit from<br/> their labour to furnish each spinner with two<br/>
                            pounds of wool, and we think it would be proper<br/> to furnish them
                            with the same quantity of flax<br/> as is proposed for the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Several of the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge Tribe<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> raise flax, &amp;
                            a number of them<br/> have sheep; and we would propose that
                            flaxseed<br/> for sowing be furnished the ensuing season to<br/> both
                            Tribes The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribe stated that<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mdoxs2">Mary Doxtady<persname key="mdoxs2"></persname></a> has devoted considerable
                            of her<br/> time to instruct them in spinning, and proposed<br/> whether
                            Friends could not see the way to make<br/> her some compensation, which
                            we think reasonable<br/> &amp; proper &amp; refer it to the
                            consideration of the General<br/> Committee; as also relative to some
                            compensation<br/> to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit2">Nancy<persname key="nsmit2"></persname></a>, wife of
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/asmit1">Aaron Smith<persname key="asmit1"></persname></a> for similar<br/>
                            services amongst the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a><pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_153" n="153"></pb></p>
<p>On deliberating on the propriety of proceeding to<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/onondaga">Onondago<placename key="onondaga"></placename></a>, we learned that having
                            been engaged<br/> in the war, they had introduced the smallpox<br/> into
                            the settlement, of which several had died &amp; <br/>a number were now
                            ill. We were further<br/> informed that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ewebs1">Ephrain
                                Webster<persname key="ewebs1"></persname></a> their interpreter<br/> was absent from home; from
                            these circumstances<br/> we concluded the views of the Committee
                            would<br/> not be answered by making them a visit at<br/> the present
                            time</p>
<p>We were accompanied in the visit by our<br/> friend <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cwill1">Charles Willetts<persname key="cwill1"></persname></a>, who has been nearly
                            four<br/> months at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a> &amp; its
                            neighbourhood, and it is but<br/> justice to him to state that his
                            presence &amp; services<br/> amongst them have been very useful at a
                            time<br/> when they were much wanted; and we are<br/> thence led to give
                            our opinion of the necessity<br/> of having a friends' family resident
                            amongst them. </p>

<p>The attention of the sub committee was satisfactory<br/> and the subjects
                    referred by it to the meeting were<br/> considered. The arrangement respecting a

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a> was approved; but information was

<br/>given by one of the Sub Committee that the School<br/>
<del>Com</del> has been of latter time discontinued in consequence<br/> of the
                    small number of Scholars at this season of<br/> the year and other
                    circumstances. The Committee<br/> taking the subject into consideration it
                    appeared to be<br/> desirable that a suitable friend should be engaged<br/> to
                    open a School amongst them the ensuing spring<br/> &amp; that in selecting him
                    attention should be given<br/> to his qualifications to furnish them advice

                    was concluded to appoint a Committee to enquire<br/> for a friend of this
                    description either single or<br/> having a family as should appear to them
                    expedient,<br/> &amp; the following friends were appointed to the service<br/>

<p>Information was given by the Sub Committee<br/> that during their visit they
                    learned that the small<br/>pox had been introduced amongst the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagos<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a><br/> &amp; was likely to spread amongst

                    judged it expedient<br/> to have them inoculated with the kine pock, which<br/>
                    had accordingly been done, and about a thousand<br/> persons had been vaccinated
                    accordingly</p>
<p>The human proceeding of the Sub Committee<br/> was approved of &amp; the cost

<floatingtext type="report">
<opener>To the Yearly Meeting</opener>
<p>The Committee on the Concern for the<br/> civilization and welfare of the
                            Indians report</p>
<p>The we have continued our attention to<br/> the trust confided to us; and
                            the Tribes under<br/> our notice, excepting one, have been visited
                            by<br/> some of our number, from whose report we<br/> are enabled to
                            give a summary account of <pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_161" n="161"></pb>
<br/>their condition. No material change appears<br/> to have taken
                            place in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/broth">Brothertown<orgname key="broth"></orgname></a> Tribe,
                            (excepting<br/> that improvements have been made in the erection<br/> of
                            several barns-) but as heretofore some are<br/> sober and industrious
                            and others the reverse</p>
<p>The same remark is applicable to the men of<br/> the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribe. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneidss">South settlement<placename key="oneidss"></placename></a><br/> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida Tribe<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> affords encouragement by<br/>
                            their improvement in agriculture, and it is hoped<br/> that the injury
                            to their morals <del>which is</del> produced<br/> by the part which they
                            and the<del>late</del> other Tribes<br/> have taken in the late war will
                            gradually be<br/> retrieved, for it was a satisfaction to remark<br/>
                            that their young men manifested less disposition<br/> to enter into the
                            army than the elder chiefs, and<br/> their stay was not long.</p>
<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_162" n="162"></pb>
<p>The School is continued at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>, and<br/> one was taught for some time in the
                            summer at<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>, by a young friend of the
                            neighbourhood<br/> but has since been discontinued.</p>
<p>Satisfactory improvement continues to be made<br/> by the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> women in spinning<br/> in each of these Tribes a
                            School for their improve<br/>ment therein has been kept, and the
                            Committee<br/> have rendered them assistance in makeing
                            compens<br/>ation to the Teachers, and in furnishing<br/> additional
                            quantities of wool and flax &amp; a<br/> number of spinning wheels</p>
<p>The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondago Tribe<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> was not visited
                            on<br/> account of the absence of their Interpreter &amp; in<br/>
                            consequence of the small pox having been<br/> introduced from the army
                            &amp; being very<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_163" n="163"></pb>
<br/>prevalent amongst them when the Committee<br/> was in that
                            neighbourhood. There being reason to<br/> apprehend that it would spread
                            in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> &amp;<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribes, the Committee
                            judged it would<br/> comport with the benevolent views of Friends
                            to<br/> endeavor to preserve them from the ravages of<br/> this malady
                            &amp; concluded to have them inoculated<br/> with the Kine Pock, which
                            after considerable<br/> difficulty occasioned by their prejudice against
                            it<br/> was effected, &amp; about a thousand individuals were<br/>
                            vaccinated. The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/onondaga">Onondagoes<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> were by
                            some<br/> other means inoculated with small pox</p>
<p>The Committee are very desirous that a<br/> friend with a family, or if
                            such cannot be<br/> found, a suitable single man may be induced<br/> to
                            reside amongst the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> for the
                            purpose<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_164" n="164"></pb>
<br/>of rendering them advice and assistance in their<br/> concerns, and
                            of taking charge of a School amongst<br/> them for which they manifest
                            much solicitude.</p>

<p>Present 22 members</p>
<p>The Committee to visit the Tribes under our<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_167" n="167"></pb>
<br/>notice made the following report</p>
<floatingtext type="report">
<p>Agreeably to our appointment six of our<br/> number have visited the
                            different Tribes of the<br/> Natives which have been under the care of
                            the<br/> Committee, had meetings of conference with them<br/> at each
                            place, read the address from the Committee<br/> to them, which with the
                            remarks made to them<br/> appeared to be recieved with much
                            cordiality</p>
<p>We found amongst the men at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a><br/> some who are improving their land, and
                            provide<br/> comfortably for their families, which may also<br/> be said
                            of those at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> &amp; the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>; but<br/> many of them as
                            heretofore are much addicted<br/> to habits of intemperance, by which
                            means their<br/> families are brought to want. But we were<br/> pleased
                            to find that the Women at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a><br/> &amp; the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> are making considerable improvement<pb facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_168" n="168"></pb>
<br/>in the art of spinning, and appeared to be much<br/> interested in
                            it. We understood that about sixty<br/> of the women at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> have learned to spin<br/> and
                            about thirty at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>. We were told
                            that<br/> two of their number at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a> who had learned<br/> to spin in the School
                            of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mdoxs2">Mary Doxtader<persname key="mdoxs2"></persname></a> have<br/> made during
                            the last year each sixty yards of<br/> linen cloth, and a number of them
                            have made<br/> cloth for fulling; and in order to encourage them<br/>
                            still further, the Committee have thought proper to<br/>grant to each
                            spinner at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a> two pounds of
                            wool<br/> and those of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a>
                            &amp; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> two pounds of<br/> flax
                            each. The Committee have thought fit<br/> to furnish the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> Tribe with a loom &amp;<br/>
                            aparatus for weaving, and two pair of Cards</p>

                            where<br/> he had paid his usual annual visit. It is<br/> believed he
                            has been very useful in reforming<br/> these Nations and divers ohers
                            whom he had<br/> visited once in the year, and by precept and<br/>
                            example encouraged temperance &amp; sobriety<br/> amongst those nations

<p>A sober man, one of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/tonaw">Tonawanta

                            interested with the subjects contained in the<br/> address, and we
                            believe he communicated it<br/> faithfully to those assembled, which
                            appeared<br/> to be received with much satisfaction by those<br/> of the

<br/>informed by our Interpreter that his Nation<br/> (the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/tonaw">Tonawantoes<orgname key="tonaw"></orgname></a>) were a sober people, which<br/>
                            we understood was generally the ease with those<br/> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/onondaga">Onondagoe<placename key="onondaga"></placename></a> many of them appear to
                            have<br/> comfortable houses, and some have Barns;<br/> their corn
                            appeared promising, and from the<br/> appearance of things amongst them,
                            we believe<br/> that they generally live comfortably in their way<br/>
                            and we apprehended that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ewebs1">Ephraim

                            have some oversight of that Tribe<br/> for the ensuing year, and for
                            such services<br/> he is to have a reasonable compensation</p>
