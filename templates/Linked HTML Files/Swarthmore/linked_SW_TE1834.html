<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and

                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                PREFACE.
                <p>IN one of my frequent visits to <a href="/people/dhosa1">Dr. Hosack<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a>, for
                    the<br/>purpose of obtaiing from him various kinds of<br/>information, to aid me
                    in completing a work I was<br/>then engaged in editing-the proper
                    acknowledg-<br/>ments for his learned and valuable assistance, I have<br/>made
                    in another place-he suggested to me that he<br/>had some time since gathered
                    materials for writing<br/>the life of a distinguished philanthropist, the
                        late<br/><a href="/people/teddy1">THOMAS EDDY<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>; but that numerous
                    circumstances<br/>had prevented him from carrying his intentions
                    into<br/>effect, and that he could not, at this time, sit down<br/>to the work.
                    After some farther conversation, he<br/> placed the papers in my hand, and I
                    found them very<br/>interesting, much more so than I could have
                    antici-<br/>pated, from the quiet life of a modest citizen. Among<br/> them I
                    discovered a correspondence with some of the<br/>first men in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> and the United States, upon the<br/>great
                    objects of reform in prisons, hospitals, penal<br/> codes, schools, and almost
                    every other topic, which<br/>the best minds of the civilized world are now
                        dis-<br/><pb n="6"></pb>cussing. I readily agreed to put those papers in<br/>
                    order, connected with a few remarks of my own, to<br/> the end that the public
                    might have some idea of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> as a
                    man, and of the great objects of his useful<br/> life. To show me the estimation
                    in which <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/> was held by the wise
                    and good, which had known<br/> him well, <a href="/people/dhosa1">Dr.
                        Hosack<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a> put into my hands the follow-<br/>ing letters, from men
                    whose sincerity is above all<br/> doubt, and whose opinions have a
                    commanding<br/>weight in society.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I have thought it due to the memory of the late <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,<br/> whose life has been very much devoted
                            to deeds of benevolence,<br/> and the improvement of the numerous public
                            institutions with<br/> which he has been connected, to communicate to
                            the public some<br/> account of his labours, and the services he has
                            rendered to this<br/> city and state.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I have placed the materials which I had col-<br/>lected
                            on this subject, into the hands of our friend, <a href="/people/sknap1">Colonel Knapp<persname key="sknap1"></persname></a>,<br/> who has kindly undertaken to embody
                            them into a volume, that<br/> cannot fail to be gladly received by the
                            community.</p>
<p>Knowing that you were one of the friends of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, and<br/> of his associates, the late <a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>, Governors <a href="/people/gclin1">George<persname key="gclin1"></persname></a><br/> and <a href="/people/dclin1">Dewitt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jjay1">Governor
                                Jay<persname key="jjay1"></persname></a>, and others with whom he<br/> co-operated in various
                            public measures, I will be obliged by any<br/> reminiscenses you may
                            possess, that will give an interest to the<br/> contemplated publication
                            of <a href="/people/sknap1">Colonel Knapp<persname key="sknap1"></persname></a>.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I was happy to learn, by your letter of the <date when="1833-04-09">9th
                                ult.</date>, that you<br/> had made arrangements for an historical
                            account of the life and<br/> services of your late excellent relative,
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, by con-<br/>fiding
                            the materials in your possession, concerning him, to the<br/> industry,
                            skill, judgment, and taste of <a href="/people/sknap1">Colonel
                                Knapp<persname key="sknap1"></persname></a>. I am<br/> satisfied that a biographical sketch of
                            the actions and character <br/>of so distinguished a philanthropist,
                            will be interesting to the<br/> cause of humanity, and acceptable to the
                            public. It was my <br/>good fortune to be numbered among the intimate
                            friends of <persname key="teddy1">Mr. <br/><pb n="10"></pb>Eddy</persname>,
                            from the year <date when="1795">1795</date> down to the period of his
                            death; and<br/>I am no stranger to the beneficial influence which he so
                            long and<br/> so successfully exerted over the several public
                            institutions with<br/>which he was connected. You are pleased to say,
                            that you<br/>would <said>be obliged by any reminiscences I may posess,
                                that<br/>will give an interest to the contemplated
                                publication.</said> This<br/>request you have recently repeated, and
                            if I was in possession of<br/>any facts that were important, and which
                            are not already matter<br/>of record, I would most cheerfully
                            communicate them. The<br/> quiet and unostentatious private life of
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,
                            afforded,<br/>however, very few materials of the kind you allude to, and
                            it is<br/>solely from a desire to gratify your wishes, and to show
                            my<br/>affection for his memory, that I have ventured (though not
                            with-<br/>out hesitation and reluctance) to submit a few notices
                            respecting<br/> my personal knowledge of his character.</p>
<p>When I first became acquainted with <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, about the<br/>year <date when="1795">1795</date>, I
                            was struck with the simplicity of his manners, and<br/>the
                            reasonableness and benevolence of his views. I soon found<br/>uncommon
                            zeal for the promotion of all kinds of public improve-<br/>ment. His
                            object and unshaken purpose seemed to be, to diffuse,<br/>by every
                            possible and reasonable effort on his part, a liberal,<br/>enlightened,
                            humane, active, and Christian public spirit. He pos-<br/>sessed, far
                            beyond the race of ordinary men, the philanthropy of<br/><a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>; and under the influence of so
                            illustrious an example,<br/>he appeared to be willing to devote himself
                                <quote>to survey the man-<br/>sions of sorrow and pain,</quote> and
                            to mitigate human misery, in<br/>whatever form it might meet the eye or
                            awaken sympathy.</p>
<p>It was among his earliest and most animating objects, to<br/>endeavour to
                            work a reformation in our penal code, and disarm<br/>it of its enormous
                            abuses and uncompromising severity. His<br/>efforts in the year <date when="1794">1794</date>, <date when="1795">1795</date>, and <date when="1796">1796</date>, to arouse public attention<br/>to the
                            subject; and to promote the establishment of a state or
                            peni-<br/>tentiary prison, as a substitute for the profligate goals and
                            san-<br/>guinary punishments, are a matter of fact, which it is not my
                            pro-<br/>vince to detail; I would merely observe, that in <date when="1797">1797</date> I became<br/> one of the persons charged
                                <emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">ex
                                officio</foreign></emph> with the execution of the<br/>penal laws,
                            and this was concurrently in point of time with the<br/>melioration of
                            the criminal code to which I have alluded, and it<br/><pb n="11"></pb>naturally led me to perceive and feel in full force, the
                            inestimable<br/>value of the change. My friendly connexion with
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/>kept gradually
                            increasing, and his ardent and disinterested<br/>efforts for the credit
                            and success of the penitentiary system, were<br/>constantly passing
                            under my eye and observation. He continued<br/>an inspector of the state
                            prison in this city, from its first erection<br/>in <date when="1796">1796</date>, to the year <date when="1803">1803</date>, and it is a
                            fact well worthy of notice,<br/>that the last year in which he had an
                            agency in the management<br/>of the prison,the profits of the labour of
                            the convicts equalled<br/>the annual expense of the establishment. The
                            prison for that<br/> year, and that year only, maintained itself. But
                            though <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/>had retired from the
                            post, he never ceased to be anxious to<br/>improve and recommend the
                            system. So late as the year <date when="1823">1823</date>,<br/>he
                            addressed a letter to the mayor of this city, suggesting
                            some<br/>judicious reforms in the prison discipline; and which have
                            since<br/>been essentially adopted. He never placed much reliance
                            on<br/>the influence of fear and severity, and he was of opinion
                            that<br/>the reformation of the convicts was to be regarded as an
                            indis-<br/>pensable object of the system.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was in the habit of
                            recommending to my notice<br/>those publications which appeared from
                            time to time to strike<br/>his mind with particular force; and those
                            that he alluded to, or<br/>presented to me, uniformly related to
                            charitable, benevolent, or<br/>religious objects. I recal the
                            recollection of such acts with<br/> much pleasure, because they give us
                            an insight into his real<br/>character, and afford incontestable
                            evidence of the goodness of<br/>his heart, and of his constant and
                            affectionate solicitude for the<br/>happiness of his friends. He
                            appeared to possess a firm Chris-<br/>tian faith, without a particle of
                            bigotry or fanaticism, and it was<br/>softened or recommended by the
                            spirit of charity. He was the<br/>determined enemy of every species of
                            doctrine that was lax in<br/> morals, or led to licentiousness in
                            practice; and the anecdote<br/>which I am about to relate, is strikingly
                            characteristic of the<br/>firm purpose with which he met and resisted
                            the false philoso-<br/>phy and profane speculations that were zealously
                            propagated<br/>towards the conclusion of the last century. Having
                            purchased<br/>Godwin's "Enquiry concerning Political Justice," which
                            obtained<br/>a transient celebrity in the year <date when="1795">1795</date>, his moral sense was so<br/>much offended by the
                            abominable doctrines contained in the lat-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_007" n="12"></pb>ter part of
                            the second volume, (and which doctrines Mr. Godwin<br/> afterwards
                            exemplified in his own case,) that he took at once a<br/> decisive step
                            to clear himself of the folly, or the guilt, of encour-<br/>aging and
                            circulating the work. He rose one evening at his<br/> own fireside, from
                            the perusal of the book, and silently, and with<br/> gravity, opened the
                            embers in the fire place, and carefully laid <br/>down and buried the
                            two volumes in the fire. His wife, who was<br/> sitting by, astonished
                            at the act, and ignorant of the cause, started<br/> up and exclaimed,
                                <said>Thomas, art thou crazy?</said></p>
<p>He was one of the governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New York
                                Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> in<br/>
<date when="1797">1797</date>, and I believe, had been one for some
                            previous time; and I<br/> considered myself as principally indebted to
                            him for my intro-<br/>duction in that year to the same trust. He acted
                            as one of the<br/> guardians of the hospital down to the spring of <date when="1827">1827</date>; and the<br/> value of his services must
                            have been inestimable. The duties<br/> which in that place were cast
                            upon him, were congenial with his<br/> disposition and character; and
                            that great establishment is deserv-<br/>edly classed among the most
                            comprehensive, practical, and bene-<br/>ficent of all the charitable
                            institutions of this country. I know <br/>of none that affords more
                            prompt and effectual relief to the mise-<br/>ries of the poorer and
                            forsaken part of mankind. He was for<br/> several years vice president,
                            and at the period of his resignation,<br/> president of the board. He
                            came to me in the spring of <date when="1827">1827</date>,<br/> (being a
                            few months before his death,) and told me that his declin-<br/>ing
                            health would not permit him to continue in the trust, and he<br/>
                            earnestly requested my consent to serve, if I should be chosen<br/> one
                            of the governors. Moved by his application, I did consent,<br/> and
                            faithful to my promise to him, I bore my portion of my bur-<br/>den of
                            the trust, for the three succeeding years ; and while in<br/> that
                            place, I could trace the influence and effects of that excellent<br/>
                            man, in every branch of the institution. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was deeply<br/> impressed with the account of
                                    <q><emph rend="italic">the Retreat</emph>,</q> an asylum
                            near<br/>the city of <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>, in
                            England, erected for insane persons, and<br/> which was much indebted
                            for its success to the early and steady<br/> efforts of <a href="/people/lmurr1">Lindley Murray<persname key="lmurr1"></persname></a>, a name familiar to the
                            friends of let-<br/>ters and humanity. In <date when="1815">1815</date>,
                            he suggested the propriety of efforts<br/> to erect and establish a
                            similar institution on this island; and one<br/> that should adopt the
                            same course of moral treatment of the luna-<br/>tic patients. He
                            presented to me at the time, a description of the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_008" n="13"></pb>Retreat, written by <a href="/people/stuke1">Samuel Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a>, and
                            he always appeared to be<br/> anxious to enlist my humble voice and
                            influence in favour of his<br/> plans of public benevolence. Provisions
                            for such an establish-<br/>ment was made by law in <date when="1816">1816</date>, and it was opened in <date when="1820">1820</date>,
                            under<br/> very favourable auspices.</p>
<p> In <date when="1819">1819</date>, he read before the governors of the
                            hospital, a <emph rend="italic">Memoir<br/> of <a href="/people/jmurr1">John Murray, Jr.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a></emph>, of this city, and brother
                            to <a href="/people/lmurr1">Lindley Mur-ray.<persname key="lmurr1"></persname></a> This he
                            presented to me, with the grateful remark that it<br/> came from my
                                <said>affectionate friend.</said> He delineates a character<br/> of
                            the most distinguished benevolence, and of remarkable purity.<br/> He
                            and <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> were scholars in the same
                            grammar school at<br/><a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                            in or about the year <date when="1770">1770</date>, and their
                            subsequent<br/> lives were devoted to charitable objects, with a
                            steadiness of pur-<br/>pose, and an ardour of zeal, that were peculiar,
                            and at the same<br/>time tempered with reason and discretion. It would
                            appear to<br/> me to be very difficult in the annals of mere mortals, to
                            find a<br/> higher and brighter example of active and unobtrusive
                            charity,<br/> goodness, and piety, than the one afforded by the life of
                                <a href="/people/jmurr1">Murray<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>,<br/> as sketched by the
                            faithful pencil of his fellow labourer in the<br/> cause of
                            humanity.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was an official agent in many
                            other public institu-<br/>tions of a charitable kind, and he was engaged
                            for a length of<br/> years in some that were more comprehensive in their
                            operation,<br/> and related to the great commercial and political
                            interests of the<br/> state. He took an early and active part in the
                            cause of internal<br/> navigation and improvement. His good sense,
                            striking probity,<br/> and public spirit, were known and highly
                            appreciated by <a href="/people/pschu1">Gene-ral Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>,
                                <a href="/people/jjay1">Governor Jay<persname key="jjay1"></persname></a>, and other eminent
                            statesmen of<br/> their time; and he became a cherished advocate and
                            assistant in<br/> all schemes of a liberal kind, and connected with the
                            public wel-<br/>fare. He was early made a director in the Western Inland
                            Lock<br/> Navigation Company, which was established in the year <date when="1792">1792</date>,<br/> and he continued a Director and
                            Treasurer of that Company,<br/> down to its final termination in <date when="1820">1820</date>. He explored the western<br/> country with a
                            view to the introduction of inland navigation in<br/>
<date when="1796">1796</date>, and his distinguished merits as one of
                            the original authors<br/> and promotors of the western canal navigation
                            have been clearly<br/> stated and illustrated in your interesting
                            "Memoir of <a href="/people/dclin1">Dewitt Clin-ton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>," and
                            I forbear to dwell on the subject. It is well known<br/> that he
                            executed the laborious and very responsible duties of one<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_009" n="14"></pb>of the canal commissioners with his customary ardour and
                            pre-<br/>cision, between the year <date when="1810">1810</date> and
                                <date when="1817">1817</date>; and he is justly entitled,<br/> as
                            jou have already shown, to share in the glory attendant on the<br/>
                            auspicious results of that magnificent project.</p>
<p> But <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy's<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> mind was equally and
                            unremittingly engaged<br/> in useful schemes of much more humble
                            pretensions. Whenever<br/> there was an institution within the reach of
                            his power and<br/> influence, created for any benevolent object, we are
                            almost sure<br/> to meet on its records and in its effects, his name and
                            his blessing.<br/> I was not associated with him, and I had not
                            therefore any direct<br/> personal acquaintance with his services, in
                            many of the public<br/> charities in which he was concerned. It ought to
                            be left to his<br/> thoroughly informed biographer, to speak of him as a
                            corres-<br/>ponding member of the <a href="/organizations/nyman">New York
                                Manumission Society<orgname key="nyman"></orgname></a>; as<br/> one of the founders and
                            trustees of the <a href="/organizations/nyfss">Free School Society in New
                                York<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>; as one of the founders and directors of the <a href="/organizations/ambib">Ameri-can Bible Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>; as one of the
                            first trustees of the <a href="/organizations/nysav">Savings Bank<orgname key="nysav"></orgname></a>
                            in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>; and as one of the first
                            managers of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/socref">Society for the Reformation of Juvenile
                                Delinquents<orgname key="socref"></orgname></a>. I have<br/>endeavoured to confine myself in
                            my remarks to matters of which<br/> I had some personal knowledge, or
                            was necessarily led to notice<br/> during the course of the
                            transactions.</p>
<p> As the life of <a href="/people/jjay1">Governor Jay<persname key="jjay1"></persname></a>, as well as
                            his own, was drawing<br/> to a close, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> appeared to be anxious to pay to that great<br/> man
                            a parting visit, and he invited me to accompany him. This<br/> was in
                            the summer of <date when="1826">1826</date>, and it was one of the most
                            delight-<br/>ful little excursions I ever had. We left New York on
                            the<br/> morning of the <date when="1826-07-26">26th of July</date>. The
                            day was bright and beautiful,<br/> and having landed at <a href="/places/sings">Sing Sing<placename key="sings"></placename></a>, we placed ourselves under
                            the<br/>guidance of <a href="/people/clynd1">Captain Lyndes<persname key="clynd1"></persname></a>,
                            and visited the new state prison<br/> establishment, which was then
                            quite unfinished. We found one<br/> hundred and thirty convicts engaged
                            in quarrying and working<br/> marble for the building; and they were
                            mostly out under a meri-<br/>dian sun, pouring its fierce blaze upon the
                            white marble blocks<br/> around them, with an ardour almost sufficient
                            to blind the eyes.<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> seemed to be at home in all
                            the details of the concern.<br/> His zeal for the improvement of
                            penitentiary discipline had not<br/> diminished in intensity. He was
                            thorough in his inspection, and <br/>inquisitive in his examination. We
                            continued our journey that<br/> afternoon to the residence of <a href="/people/jjay1">Governor Jay<persname key="jjay1"></persname></a>, at <a href="/places/bedfo">Bedford<placename key="bedfo"></placename></a>, and we <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_010" n="15"></pb>found that illustrious
                            statesman and christian sage, sitting on the<br/> piazza under the
                            lengthened shadows of the sun, with a long<br/> pipe by his side, in
                            full view of the simple and solid rural<br/> improvements of the place;
                            and in the attitude of one at peace<br/> with himself, and with all
                            around him. I was painfully struck<br/> with the ravages of time upon
                            him, and the change that had taken<br/> place in his visage and
                            appearance, since I last had the satisfac-<br/>tion of seeing him some
                            years before. At first, he did not appear<br/> to recollect me; and this
                            was the only instance that I perceived<br/> of any direct decay of his
                            mental faculties. He conversed that<br/> evening and the next morning
                            cheerfully and correctly, and<br/> seemed to be much interested in
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy's<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> conversation, and
                            to<br/> sympathise with him in his feelings and concerns. Those two<br/>
                            venerable men (the one then being in his seventy-sixth year, and<br/>
                            the other in his eighty-first year) had been intimate friends; with<br/>
                            correspondent principles in all matters of personal duty, and of<br/>
                            good will to men, from a period which commenced soon after the<br/>
                            conclusion of the American war. We returned to town the next<br/> day,
                            and <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy,<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> in the course of this
                            tour, interested me<br/> exceedingly with anecdotes and occurrences
                            connected with his<br/> early life, in this city, during the
                            revolutionary war, and down to<br/> the period of our first
                            acquaintance. I have only to add, that<br/> while upon this last visit,
                            his cheerful, free, varied, and instructive<br/> conversation, gave me
                            additional cause to love and admire him.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>The Life of the late <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> is
                            about to be published by<br/><a href="/people/sknap1">Colonel

<p>It gave me much pleasure to learn by thy letter of yesterday,<br/> that a

                            and the story of his benevolent<br/> career will not fail to encourage

                            conversed on topics which were favourite<br/> with us both; but on the

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>

<p>I some time since determined to prepare a sketch of the life of<br/> the
                            late <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, who, like another
                                <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>, has devoted<br/> himself
                            to the cause of humanity and benevolence. For this<br/> purpose I have
                            collected many valuable materials; these I have<br/> placed in the hands
                            of my friend. <a href="/people/sknap1">Colonel Knapp<persname key="sknap1"></persname></a>, who will
                            give<br/> them to the public. Knowing that you have been many years<br/>
                            associated with <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> in the

                            MY DEAR SIR,</opener>
<p> It gives me great pleasure to learn that the biography of<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> is to be written by so
                            able a hand as <a href="/people/sknap1">Mr. Knapp.<persname key="sknap1"></persname></a><br/> I
                            should be very happy to give him any information in my power,<br/> which
                            might tend to rescue from oblivion the merits and many<br/> virtues of
                            our deceased friend. All I can say might be comprised<br/> in these few
                            words:—That I knew him, and was very much asso-<br/>ciated with him
                            during the last thirty years of his life ; and that<br/> there is no
                            benevolent or charitable institution founded in that time,<br/> of which
                            he was not the zealous promoter, if the project for its<br/>
                            establishment did not originate with him. I would be more
                            par-<br/>ticular, but my memory does not serve me as to dates, and I
                            have<br/> no documents to which I can refer. I will nevertheless
                            attempt<br/> to give the general recollections of my associations with
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>.<br/> If it should be
                            important to ascertain the dates connected with<br/> the circumstances I
                            shall mention; it may be done by resorting<br/> to the public records,
                            or the records of institutions of which he<br/> was a member.</p>
<p>So far as I recollect, my first acquaintance with <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> com-<br/>menced, from our having had the same
                            views as to what has been<br/> called the amelioration of our criminal
                            code. I mean the criminal<br/> code of the state of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>; and you must understand me<br/>
                            throughout as writing as if I were in <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>; I was then quite<br/> a young man, and I am not
                            certain that my mind did not receive<br/> the strong bias it had in
                            favour of the abolition of the punishment<br/> of death, from <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>; though I, at that time, differed
                            from <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_013" n="18"></pb> him as to the extent of this abolition : he
                            desiring that life should<br/> not be taken in any case; and I believing
                            that this highest<br/> punishment should be reserved for the highest
                            crimes. After-<br/>wards, in the year <date when="1825">1825</date>, I
                            think, when <a href="/people/salle1">Mr. Allen<persname key="salle1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/gtibb1">Mr. Tibbits<persname key="gtibb1"></persname></a>,<br/> and <a href="/people/shopk1">Mr. Hopkins<persname key="shopk1"></persname></a>, were making some investigations relative
                            to<br/> the state prison, they circulated a number of queries, and
                            addressed<br/> copies of them to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> and myself. We each wrote answers.<br/> They came so
                            late, that they are not printed with the report of<br/> the
                            commissioners; but Mr. Eddy being unwilling that they<br/> should be
                            lost, obtained from me a copy of my answers to the<br/>commissioners,
                            and published his and mine in a small pamphlet <br/>at his expense. This
                            is evidence of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s liberality,
                            not<br/> only as to pecuniary consideration, but as to his toleration of
                            prin-<br/>ciples which differed from his own; for while his letters to
                            the<br/> commissioners, zealously maintained that imprisonment was
                            suf-<br/>ficient punishment for any crime ; I expressed the opinion
                            that<br/> I at that time continued to entertain, that the most
                            atrocious<br/> guilt, such as wilful and deliberate murder, should be
                            punished<br/> with death. Before I pursue this subject farther, I will
                            mention<br/> a circumstance which made a strong impression on my mind,
                            and<br/> convinced me, that however adverse the Society of Friends
                            were<br/> to the punishment of death, they had rather that it should
                            be<br/> inflicted in some cases, than that the guilty should escape
                            with<br/> impunity. A female belonging to the Society, or who was
                            at<br/> least professedly a Friend, was found a corpse, under
                            circumstan-<br/>ces that left no doubt of her having been murdered. I
                            was then<br/> assistant attorney general. The first information I had of
                            this<br/> crime, was from <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,
                                <a href="/people/rbown1">Robert Browne<persname key="rbown1"></persname></a>, and several others
                            of the<br/> same high standing in the Society of Friends, who called on
                            me to<br/> institute a prosecution against the person suspected; and
                            through the<br/> whole progress of the prosecution they were active and
                            zealous in<br/> their efforts to furnish me with the means of developing
                            the truth.</p>
<p> It is well known that the laws for establishing our state prison,<br/>
                            owed their origin more to the part taken by the Society of Friends,<br/>
                            than to any exertions in their favour by any other class in the
                            com-<br/>munity. And among these, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, as he was in every thing<br/> in which he engaged,
                            the most active and the most zealous, in<br/> this matter, as in others,
                            in which the public good was concerned,<br/> be devoted himself to its
                            success, with all the industry and earnest-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_014" n="19"></pb>ness, that
                            he could have done if his own interest had been his<br/> object; and I
                            am convinced that he would not have felt the same<br/> gratification
                            from obtaining any private advantage, that he did,<br/> from the
                            adoption of those laws by the legislature, which he had<br/> long and
                            ardently advocated, and which he considered as setting<br/> an example
                            which would meliorate the condition of mankind.<br/> The members of the
                            first board of governors of the state prison<br/> were mostly taken from
                            the society of Friends. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                            held<br/> the principal office, under the title, I think, of
                            superintendent.</p>
<p> The assistant attorney general was, ex-officio, connected with<br/> the
                            administration of the prison, and this gave me an oppor-<br/>tunity of
                            observing its management and government. The<br/> good order, comfort,
                            cleanliness, industry, and devotion which<br/> prevailed, as long as the
                            Friends had the management of the<br/> institution, were very
                            remarkable. But in <date when="1800">1800</date>, when there<br/> was a
                            great revolution in political power, those who had effected<br/> the
                            change thought their influence should be felt every where;<br/> and
                            though there was no emolument annexed to the office of<br/> governor of
                            the prison, there were those of the dominant party,<br/> whose ambition
                            was to be gratified by being put in the place of<br/> the Friends who
                            were managers of the institution. The differ-<br/>ence between the
                            government of those who took the office merely<br/> from motives of
                            philanthropy, and who devoted themselves to the<br/> discharge of its
                            duties, and those who held it as an honorary dis-<br/>tinction, that
                            deserved but little sacrifice of their private business,<br/> was soon
                            perceived. The new management was so bad, that it<br/> had very nearly
                            occasioned the failure of this great experiment;<br/> and nothing was
                            more common than to hear it said, even by<br/> many of its original
                            advocates, that it had done so, and that there<br/> was no resource but
                            to the former sanguinary penal code. I have<br/> often heard <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> lament this state of things; but he
                            never<br/> abandoned the hope of seeing a system, of which he very
                            justly<br/> considered himself as one of the founders, established; and
                            he<br/> lost no opportunity of inviting the public attention to means
                            by<br/> which he thought the objections to the new code might be
                            obviated.<br/> He proposed that county or district prisons or
                            penitentiaries should<br/> be erected. That the prison of the state
                            should be reserved for<br/> offenders of the highest grade, while those
                            of a lower degree<br/> should be punished in the former. I am convinced
                            that among <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_015" n="20"></pb>his manuscripts will be found many pieces
                            that he has written<br/> on this subject.</p>
<p>It is very possible that my connexion with the <a href="/organizations/nyman">Manumission Society<orgname key="nyman"></orgname></a>, brought me acquainted with him
                            as a member of that<br/> institution, previously to my having had
                            intercourse with him as<br/> an advocate of the amelioration of our
                            penal code. It is known<br/> how much that society is, and always has
                            been, in the hands of<br/> members of the society of Friends, and how
                            far the act abo-<br/>lishing slavery, is owing to their exertions. In
                            this, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/> took a leading
                            part. I well remember, however, that he was<br/> adverse to the
                            colonization society; and he discouraged the first<br/> attempts which
                            were made to establish a branch of the society<br/> in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. He thought it was a scheme of the
                            slave holders<br/> to perpetuate slavery, rather than intended as a
                            means of eman-<br/>cipation. Their design, in his opinion, was to make
                            the society<br/>instrumental in ridding them of their old or worthless
                            slaves, and<br/> thereby enable them to perpetuate the bondage of the
                            young and<br/> valuable; whereas, if the slave holding states were
                            obliged to<br/> bear the burthen of those the society would take off
                            their hands,<br/> he thought these states would the sooner be compelled
                            to adopt<br/> measures that would give freedom to the blacks. <a href="/places/teddy1">Mr. Eddy's<placename key="teddy1"></placename></a> rea-<br/>soning on this subject,
                            induced me to adopt his sentiments. But if<br/> he had lived to have had
                            a better view of the objects of the Society,<br/> and to witness their
                            extraordinary success, I cannot doubt but that<br/> he would have
                            yielded, as I have done, his prejudices against this<br/> valuable
                            institution. I am the more induced to think that this<br/> would have
                            been the case, from considering the very active part<br/> which
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> afterwards took in a
                            project which was set on<br/> foot, I think, in the year <date when="1825">1825</date>, and to which, if it had succeeded,<br/>
                            there would have been the same objections which there were in<br/> his
                            mind to colonization societies. About the time I have men-<br/>tioned,
                            the President of <a href="/places/haiti">Hayti<placename key="haiti"></placename></a> sent a
                                <a href="/people/grand2">Mr. Grandville<persname key="grand2"></persname></a>, a coloured<br/>
                            gentleman, as an ambassador to <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. His object was to<br/> induce black people to
                            emigrate to that island, at the expense of<br/> its government, with an
                            offer of land and means of living when<br/> they arrived there.
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was indefatigable in his
                            exertions<br/> to promote the views of Mr. <a href="/people/grand2">Grandville<persname key="grand2"></persname></a>. He formed a society for<br/> this purpose.
                            Considerable funds were raised, and the Haytian<br/> emissary returned
                            to his government with a cargo of emigrants.<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_016" n="21"></pb>They were accompanied by an agent of the society, who
                            managed<br/> to quarrel with the government of the island. The
                            emigrants<br/> were disappointed. They alleged that the promises made
                            to<br/> them were not fulfilled, and the whole thing ended in a
                            heavy<br/> expense to the members of the Society.</p>
<p> There was nothing in which <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                            took a deeper or more<br/> active interest, than in the establishment of
                            our free schools. But<br/> I had no particular connexion with that
                            institution. I can there-<br/>fore only say, that I have often visited
                            them with him, and been<br/> witness of the zeal he manifested for their
                            prosperity. <a href="/people/dclin1">Go-vernor Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a> was
                            the great patron of this and other benevolent<br/> establishments, in
                            which <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was concerned; and I
                            believe<br/> we owe the assistance they have derived from <a href="/people/dclin1">Mr. Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>'s great<br/> talents and
                            influence, more to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> than to
                            any other man.<br/> The history of the New York canals will show how
                            large a<br/> share <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had in
                            directing <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>'s attention
                            to<br/> these great projects.</p>
<p> I found <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> a governor of the
                                <a href="/places/newyh">New York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, (of<br/> which
                            he died president) when I was elected to that office about<br/> the year
                                <date when="1812">1812</date>. I believe he had been in that station
                            from a very<br/> early date. There, as elsewhere, he was one of the most
                            efficient<br/> and useful members of the institution to which he
                            belonged. In<br/> the year <date when="1816">1816</date>, I think the
                            legislature made a very liberal grant<br/> of an increased revenue to
                            the hospital. This was obtained<br/> entirely by the exertions and
                            address of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, who spent<br/>
                            the greater part of a winter at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, to obtain the grant. Per-<br/>haps the
                            institution is more indebted to the good management of<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, than to the liberality of
                            the legislature. For it has<br/> been said, and I believe, not without
                            foundation, that the members<br/> of the legislature were not aware of
                            the extent of their endow-<br/>ment. The duration of annuity which is
                            granted, depends on<br/> the duration of a previous grant, which, it is
                            said, it was supposed<br/>was more limited, than upon examination is
                            found to be the case.<br/> But this ample provision induced the
                            governors of the hospital<br/> to turn their attention to a separate
                            establishment for the insane,<br/> for whom the accommodations afforded
                            by the city buildings were<br/> very inconvenient. In making a new
                            provision for this class of<br/> patients, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> engaged with his accustomed energy, and<br/> from
                            his exertions, and the co-operation of those associated with<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_017" n="22"></pb>him, grew the magnificent Lunatic Asylum at <a href="/places/bloomd">Bloomingdale<placename key="bloomd"></placename></a>,<br/> He was chairman of the
                            committee of Governors of the Hospi-<br/>tal under whose superintendence
                            the buildings were erected, and<br/> who had the management of the
                            concern till the patients were<br/> removed to it; and till long after a
                            system was arranged for the <br/>government of the house and the
                            treatment of the subjects. In<br/> all this, no one had so large a part
                            as <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, and no one<br/> devoted
                            so much time and attention to the establishment.</p>
<p> As any thing I may write, can only serve as memoranda, which<br/> will
                            direct the attention of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s
                            biographer to the history<br/> or records of the institutions with which
                            he was connected, I<br/> may mention that I was a long time associated
                            with him as a<br/> member of the <a href="/organizations/humso">Humane
                                Society<orgname key="humso"></orgname></a>. This was an association, which<br/> had its
                            origin long before I knew any thing of it. The objects<br/> of this
                            association, were to provide food for the destitute, and,<br/>
                            particularly, to supply the debtors in prison with some of the<br/>
                            necessaries of life. At that time these objects of charity made<br/> an
                            irresistible appeal to the attention of the benevolent. For it<br/> is
                            strange that the laws which shut a person up within the walls<br/> of a
                            prison, because he did not, and in most cases could not, pay<br/> his
                            debt, made no provision for supplying him either with fire,<br/> food,
                            or raiment. As you well know, the first soup house that was<br/> ever
                            opened in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, was established
                            by this society, and it<br/> should not be forgotten, that the fears of
                            the members that their funds<br/> were not equal to this enterprise,
                            were overcome by your liberal<br/> engagement to defray from out your
                            own purse all that might be<br/> required, beyond the means the friends
                            of the society could afford.</p>
<p> The views which were presented to many members of this<br/> society, of
                            the condition of the poor in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, led<br/> to the formation, in the year <date when="1816">1816</date>, of a <a href="/organizations/spaup">society for the
                                preventionof pauperism<orgname key="spaup"></orgname></a>; in the establishment of
                            which, and in its action,<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> took a more active part than
                            any other man. This<br/> society was merged in the <a href="/organizations/socref">Society for the Reformation of Juve-nile
                            Delinquents<orgname key="socref"></orgname></a>, or House of Refuge, which was incorporated
                            in<br/> the year <date when="1824">1824</date>. This institution, after
                            it had been in operation<br/> two years, <a href="/people/dclin1">Mr.
                                Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a> described in his annual message to the<br/>
                            legislature of <date when="1826">1826</date>, as <said who="dclin1">perhaps the best penitentiary institution<br/> which has ever been
                                devised by the wit, and established by the<br/>beneficence of
                                man.</said> I had a more intimate association with<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_018" n="23"></pb><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> in this charity from
                            its origin to his death, than in any<br/> of the others of which we were
                            members. Though there were<br/> many who participated with him in this
                            humane enterprise, yet<br/> I do not think it is going too far to say
                            that its foundation and<br/> success was in a great measure owing to
                            him; at least it may<br/> be questioned whether, without his
                            indefatigable exertions, this<br/> important measure for the prevention
                            of crimes, would have been<br/> adopted so soon. He devoted so much of
                            his time to this esta-<br/>blishment, and occupied himself so much with
                            its concerns for<br/> several years, that he seemed to have no business
                            of a public or<br/>private nature which he thought so important, or so
                            deserving<br/> his attention, It may be worthy of remark, that though
                            there<br/> had been penitentiaries or asylums for infant criminals in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>,<br/> previously to the
                            establishment of the House of Refuge, yet<br/> there had not been any
                            institution for the reformation of juvenile<br/> delinquents. This
                            differed from all others that before existed in<br/> this important
                            feature. That the laws subjected to its discipline<br/> persons under
                            age, previously to their having committed any<br/> crime, when they are
                            without parents, or abandoned by them,<br/> and are left without
                            guardian or protection, and are found pur-<br/>suing vicious courses,
                            they may be committed to the House of<br/> Refuge, where they are
                            withdrawn from the power of their<br/> parents even, till such
                            provisions is made for them as the law<br/> prescribes. The idea of
                            giving this very enlarged power to<br/> magistrates and managers of the
                            House of Refuge, I believe,<br/> originated with <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>. If the <a href="/organizations/socref">society for the
                                reformation of juvenile delinquents<orgname key="socref"></orgname></a> was deprived of
                            this power, it would lose the<br/> greater part of its usefulness.
                            Another of our most important<br/> and benevolent institutions, owes its
                            origin to the members of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/spaup">society for the prevention of pauperism<orgname key="spaup"></orgname></a>;
                            I refer to the <a href="/organizations/nysav">SavingsBank<orgname key="nysav"></orgname></a>. To this
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> devoted himself with his
                            usual zeal<br/> and energy, and remained one of its most efficient and
                            active<br/> managers while he lived.</p>
<p>To this list of the numerous benevolent societies of which <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was a member, I must add
                            another establishment, of which<br/> he was a founder, and continued a
                            manager, until he thought<br/> its successful operation was secured.
                            This was a society to pro-<br/>vide fuel for the poor. Those who had not
                            the means of laying<br/> up a store, were to deposit their money with
                            the society; who<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_019" n="24"></pb>were to lay it out on wood or coal, at
                            the proper season when<br/> these articles are cheapest; and to let the
                            depositor draw to the<br/> amount of his deposit when it was most
                            needed, for the cost at<br/> which it had been purchased by the society.
                            But <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy's<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/>other avocations
                            obliged him, after some time, to withdraw from<br/> this institution;
                            and for the want of that zeal with which he<br/> devoted himself to all
                            affairs of this kind in which he engaged,<br/> or from some other cause,
                            this very benevolent attempt to relieve<br/> the distress which so often
                            results from cold and poverty, after<br/> one or two seasons, was
                            neglected or relinquished. Notwith-<br/>standing <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was so successful and useful in the many<br/>
                            humane institutions I have enumerated, his active and benevolent<br/>
                            mind was engaged in other projects for the advantage or relief<br/> of
                            the distressed; among these he had much at heart an asylum<br/> for
                            convicts who had expiated their crime, by having suffered the<br/>
                            punishment of imprisonment. He saw with all the sympathy of<br/> his
                            character, the forlorn condition of those who, without money,<br/>
                            without friends, and without character, were turned from the walls<br/>
                            of a prison, to provide for themselves means of subsistence, and<br/> to
                            whom there seems to be left the only alternative of committing<br/> a
                            new crime, or of perishing. He proposed to establish for such<br/>
                            objects a House of Refuge, where employment of some profit<br/> should
                            be provided for them, until by their good conduct they<br/> could
                            retrieve their character, and by their industry provide some<br/> means
                            of support, till they could begin the world anew.</p>
<p>I have not referred to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s
                            connexion with our literary<br/> and scientific institutions, of all of
                            which I believe we were<br/> members. Of his usefulness as an associate
                            with us in these<br/> establishments, you will be much more able to
                            speak of him than<br/> I am. And after all, my dear sir, I can not but
                            perceive how<br/> little more I have done than if I had given a list of
                            our benevo-<br/>lent and charitable institutions, and said that
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was a zea-<br/>lous and
                            efficient member of each of them. But then I should<br/> have lost the
                            opportunity of saying how sincerely I respected his<br/> character, and
                            of manifesting the desire that I have, that the<br/> memory of his great
                            benevolence, his devotion to the welfare of<br/> mankind, and his many
                            virtues, should be preserved; and that he<br/> may he pointed out to
                            posterity, as an example of how much good<br/> may be done by an
                            individual who will devote his time and talents<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_020" n="25"></pb>to its
                            accomplishment. And had I not complied with your<br/> request, I should
                            also have lost the pleasure which I have, my<br/> dear sir, in assuring
                            you of the sincere respect with which</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>Knowing the intimacy which once existed between you and<br/> the late

                            idle apo-<br/>logy for taxing you, as I believe you will agree with me
                            in opinion,<br/> that if it be a duty, as we are in the habit of
                            thinking it to be, to<br/> attend the funereal rites of a departed
                            friend, that it is a higher<br/> duty, and of more importance to the

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>A personal acquaintance of more than twenty years with the<br/> late Mr.
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, might justify me in
                            answering at some<br/> length your several interrogatories concerning
                            his life and public<br/> services; but I have deemed it most judicious
                            to restrict this com-<br/>munication to a few particulars, inasmuch as
                            you are so amply<br/> furnished with authentic materials for your
                            contemplated biogra-<br/>phy. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                            was so intimately and for so long a period asso-<br/>ciated with the men
                            and measure of most of our humane, bene-<br/>volent, and literary
                            institutions, that his career is in no small<br/> degree connected with
                            the history of those establishments, and<br/> demonstrates that a
                            cardinal object of his pursuit, was to melio-<br/>rate the condition of
                            human society.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_021" n="26"></pb>
<p>Were I to select the especial objects which, amidst the great<br/>
                            variety that demanded his services, more particularly absorbed<br/> his
                            attention, and occupied his deepest consideration, I might<br/> dwell
                            upon his close devotion to the interests of the African; the<br/>
                            promotion of the leading measures of the Manumission Society;<br/> and
                            the enactment of laws for the final abolition of slavery in the<br/>
                            state of New York. The education of the blacks, and the
                            esta-<br/>blishment of African free schools, were also among the objects
                            of<br/> his solicitude. The bettering the condition of the poor,
                            the<br/> organization of the Lancasterian free schools, and an
                            improved<br/> code of prison discipline, were subjects which engrossed
                            most<br/> of his time for many years; and I think you will find
                            many<br/> documents among his papers, which evince his successful
                            efforts<br/>to further these benevolent purposes.</p>
<p>The claims of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> to a lasting
                            consideration will, how-<br/>ever, I think, rest mainly on the early
                            begun and long continued<br/> zeal and abilities which he exhibited on
                            the subject of insanity,<br/> and the unfortunate beings afflicted with
                            that calamity. At a<br/> comparatively youthful period of his life, he
                            was appointed to the<br/> duties of hospital direction; and he seems at
                            nearly the same<br/> period to have turned his attention to the
                            treatment and hospital<br/> discipline of those afflicted with mental
                            derangement. Our esta-<br/>blishments for the better medical government
                            of lunacy were<br/> then very few and imperfect. <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> had indeed done<br/> something—<a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> nothing. The public spirited
                            governors<br/> of the <a href="/places/newyh">New York
                                Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, were induced from urgent represent¬<br/>ations
                            made them, to erect a separate edifice on the hospital-<br/> grounds for
                            the exclusive benefit of lunatics ; and this institution,<br/> which
                            opened its doors in <date when="1808">1808</date>, under the
                            professional direction<br/> of the late <a href="/people/dbruc1">Dr.
                                Bruce<persname key="dbruc1"></persname></a>, for a while seemed to answer the benevo-<br/>lent
                            intentions of the board of governors. It was, however, ere<br/> long,
                            apparent that this city asylum was of too limited a capacity<br/> for
                            the accommodation of its numerous applicants; nor was the<br/>
                            receptacle itself of the character demanded for the afflicted and<br/>
                            valuable beings of all ranks of society who became the inmates<br/> of
                            it. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had read much, and
                            thought much on the sub-<br/>jects of mental derangement, on prison and
                            penitentiary discipline,<br/> on the structure and economy of
                            mad-houses, and on the domestic<br/> and sanative treatment of the
                            insane. His correspondence with<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_022" n="27"></pb>several distinguished
                            characters abroad, favoured the accuracy<br/> and accumulation of his
                            knowledge on these engrossing topics:<br/> his intimate and free verbal
                            disquisitions on all these several<br/> matters with that excellent man
                            and eminent philanthropist, the<br/> late <a href="/people/jmurr1">John
                                Murray, jun.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a> strengthened his views : he compared
                            the<br/> facts thus derived from these several sources, with his
                            personal<br/> experience at the city asylum of the <a href="/places/newyh">New York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, where<br/> he was almost
                            daily engaged: the result was a firmer conviction<br/> in him, that much
                            improvement might be made in the govern-<br/>ment and remedial treatment
                            of mental derangement.</p>
<p> The writings and reports of <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>, of
                            Ferriar, of Haygarth,<br/> and of Lind, on prisons, fever hospitals, and
                            houses of recovery,<br/> were the principal sources, whence, at that
                            time, information was<br/> derived touching these momentous subjects;
                            and few looked fur-<br/>ther for knowledge on the diseases of the mind
                            than to the pages<br/> of Crighton, Haslam, Pinel, and Rush. It was
                            therefore with<br/> no ordinary solicitude that the friends of humanity
                            in America<br/> heard of the success which crowned the benevolent
                            exertions of<br/> the Society of Friends, near <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>, in England, who had esta-<br/>blished a Retreat
                            for the Insane, for the express purpose of insti-<br/>tuting a milder
                            system of management than had previously been<br/> employed. Some
                            account of the Retreat was published by <a href="/people/stuke1">Mr.
                                Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a> in <date when="1813">1813</date>. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> entered into a correspondence
                            with<br/> that gentleman, in order to obtain more ample and precise
                            infor<br/>mation than <a href="/people/stuke1">Mr. Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a>'s work
                            afforded. Shortly subsequent to<br/> this date, the important
                            parliamentary investigations on the<br/> management of the mad-houses of
                                <a href="/places/gbrit">Great Britain<placename key="gbrit"></placename></a> were
                            instituted;<br/> and the elaborate reports which soon followed, embodied
                            such a<br/> mass of facts, of indubitable authenticity and vital
                            consideration,<br/> as left not a doubt in the minds of the most
                            sceptical, that perni-<br/>cious errors widely prevailed on the nature
                            of insanity; that<br/> gross evils and enormous barbarities were
                            inflicted on the unfor-<br/>tunate victims of madness, as salutary and
                            requisite principles of<br/> medical treatment; that in several of these
                            institutions, to the<br/> miseries inseparable to a loss of reason, were
                            added the horrors<br/> and atrocities of brutalized ignorance, refined,
                            if I may so say,<br/> by the absurdest therapeutical doctrines which the
                            sophistry of<br/> man ever invented. Happily, at the same time, these
                            investiga-<br/>tions and inquiries, while they gave multiplied proofs of
                            frightful <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_023" n="28"></pb>abuses, demonstrated that in numerous cases
                            mental alienation,<br/> like many physical infirmities, strictly so
                            considered, was often<br/> remediable; that to pronounce a condemnation
                            of the insane to<br/> total incapability of medical relief in all after
                            life, was a decision<br/> at variance with the strongest evidence of a
                            contrary character,<br/> deduced from the results of the practice, not
                            only at the Retreat<br/> at <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>, but
                            of the Asylums at <a href="/places/notth">Nottingham<placename key="notth"></placename></a>,
                                <a href="/places/glasg">Glasgow<placename key="glasg"></placename></a>, and other<br/> places ;
                            in short, that individuals who had lost health and reason,<br/> might be
                            restored to both, by the judicious use of medicine, and<br/> a mild
                            moral management.</p>
<p>Fortified with such testimony, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.

                            eminent citizens among us, of whom I<br/> may particularly notice the
                            late Mr. <a href="/people/jmurr1">John Murray, jun.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>, the late<br/>
<a href="/people/mclar1">General Clarkson<persname key="mclar1"></persname></a>, and the late
                                <a href="/people/tfran1">Thomas Franklin<persname key="tfran1"></persname></a>, in an
                            applica-<br/>tion to our legislature for efficient means to enable the
                            gover-<br/>nors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New York
                                Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, to erect a suitable establishment<br/> for the
                            insane, on a scite appropriate to such an object. The<br/> result, was
                            the ample grant by the state of <a href="/places/new yo">New
                                York<placename key="new yo"></placename></a>, and the<br/> delightful grounds and improvements
                            connected therewith. The<br/> whole is a proud trophy of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s laudable perseverance;<br/> while
                            the act by which it was secured, will ever remain conspi-<br/>cuous
                            among the many which characterized the administration<br/> of <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor De Witt Clinton.<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a></p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, in common with many other
                            benevolent individuals,<br/> was at first disposed to place a more
                            entire reliance on the moral<br/> management of insanity, to the
                            exclusion of all medical treat-<br/>ment, than, I think, the facts in
                            the case warrant. This belief I<br/> know, he for some time cherished;
                            but the enlarged experience<br/> and personal observation which for many
                            years he afterwards<br/> enjoyed at the noble institution which his own
                            efforts so power-<br/>fully contributed to organize, led him to qualify
                            his views on the<br/> curative means in lunacy. Having, while in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, at the time<br/> when the
                            management and treatment of the insane constituted a<br/> prominent
                            subject of discussion, visited most of the lunatic insti-<br/>tutions of
                                <a href="/places/gbrit">Great Britain<placename key="gbrit"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/holla">Holland<placename key="holla"></placename></a>, I became fully<br/> convinced that those
                            asylums in which a prompt and judicious<br/> medical practice was
                            adopted, afforded the largest favourable<br/> results of the tractable
                            nature of many forms of diseased mani-<br/>festations of mind: that such
                            indeed was the case even at the <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_024" n="29"></pb>Retreat at <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>, where the number of recoveries was
                            greater<br/> when well directed medical discipline was united to moral
                            means<br/> of relief; at the asylum at <a href="/places/glasg">Glasgow<placename key="glasg"></placename></a>, and at La Sal Petrierie,<br/>
<a href="/places/chara">Charanton, France<placename key="chara"></placename></a>, under the
                            direction of <a href="/people/mpine1">M. Pinel<persname key="mpine1"></persname></a>, the first<br/>
                            among the moderns for adopting the moral system; while, on the<br/>
                            other hand, in <a href="/places/holla">Holland<placename key="holla"></placename></a>, where through
                            a mistaken belief that<br/> the maniac is unsusceptible of mental
                            enjoyment, and that insanity<br/> is deemed an intractable disorder, no
                            curative measures were<br/> employed, and of consequence, recovery was
                            protracted and<br/> indeed rarely took place.*<br/><note rend="asterisk">Some of the abuses which I witnessed in <a href="/places/holla">Holland<placename key="holla"></placename></a>, in the treatment of the<br/> insane, were
                                scarcely inferior in their enormity, to those of the metropolitan<br/>
<a href="/places/bethh">Bethlehem Hospital<placename key="bethh"></placename></a>, as brought to
                                light by parliamentary investigation. I hardly<br/> know whether the
                                memorable case of <a href="/people/wnorr1">William Norris<persname key="wnorr1"></persname></a>
                                surpassed in cruelty an<br/> example which presented itself to me of
                                an aged male adult, who had been<br/> manacled and confined for some
                                twelve years, under circumstances of suffer-<br/>ings, privations,
                                and tortures, a parallel to which <a href="/people/hasl1">Mr.
                                    Haslam<persname key="hasl1"></persname></a> alone could pro-<br/>bably supply. Other cases
                                of a like character I might detail as specimens of<br/> the practice
                                of that country. Doubtless, the treatment of insanity has been<br/>
                                more humanely regarded in <a href="/places/holla">Holland<placename key="holla"></placename></a>, as well as elsewhere, within the past
                                fif-<br/>teen or sixteen years.</note></p>
<p> The evidence deduced from truths of this nature, and the
                            con-<br/>stantly accumulating proofs in behalf of medical treatment
                            which<br/> modern experience supplied, doubtless had their influence in
                            caus-<br/>ing <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> several years
                            before his death, to adopt the opinion<br/> that the proper
                            administration of medicinal agents, was favoura-<br/>ble to the
                            treatment of insanity; nay, oftentimes indispensable.</p>
<p> There is another circumstance I can hardly allow to be passed<br/> over
                            on this occasion without a remark, and which I think has<br/> been a
                            concurring cause of the too hasty and too general adop-<br/>tion of
                            moral management, as of itself alone the essential means of<br/> cure of
                            maniacal subjects. The delirium of inebriety, and the<br/> more advanced
                            forms of diseased action denominated <emph rend="italic">delirium<br/>
                                tremens</emph>, have inadvertently been confounded with <emph rend="italic">idiopathic<br/> mania</emph>; and inasmuch as the
                            right use of reason is for the most<br/> part, in those cases, soon
                            restored by mere abstraction from noxious<br/> potation, which is
                            effectually secured by confinement, moral<br/> management, without other
                            aid, has been allowed an undue<br/> weight in the curative process of
                            genuine mania. I am aware<br/> that permanent cerebral disorganization
                            may arise from intem-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_025" n="30"></pb>perance in drink, as dissection
                            has repeatedly shown; but the<br/> neglect of a distinct pathognomonic
                            difference between the<br/> ravings of inebriety, or delirium tremens,
                            and mental derange<br/>ment, strictly so considered, have led to gross
                            miscalculations in<br/> our prognosis. As alcoholic insanity is
                            engendered in every<br/> country where drunkenness prevails, it is
                            perhaps more fre-<br/>quently seen in our <emph rend="italic">mixed</emph> population, than in that of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.<br/> Hence we have sometimes been led to
                            pronounce hastily and<br/> erroneously that our success in the
                            management of lunacy is<br/> greater than that of other nations. We,
                            however, must be sup-<br/>plied with more extensive and more accurate
                            tabular views of the<br/> comparative results of practice, in different
                            institutions abroad and<br/> at home, before we can come to a
                            satisfactory conclusion on this<br/> contested head. It is cheering to
                            the feelings of the philanthro-<br/>pist to know, that by remedial
                            measures, much more is accom-<br/>plished at the present day, than was
                            at a former time imagined<br/> practicable; and <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s convictions in after life, that the<br/>
                            treatment of derangements of the mind, like that of disorders of<br/>
                            the body, would ere long bear signal triumphs of professional skill<br/>
                            in the healing art, seem likely to be experienced at no very remote<br/>
                            period.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s name is associated with
                            those of Fulton, <a href="/people/ccold1">Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>,<br/> Morris,
                            Van Rensselaer, Hawley, and others, in projecting the<br/> canal system
                            of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. Years before the
                            commencement<br/> of the <geogname key="eriec">Erie</geogname> and
                                <geogname key="hudsc">Hudson Canal</geogname>, he entertained
                            enlarged views,<br/> founded on extensive personal knowledge of the
                            country, of the<br/> expediency and practicability of inland
                            communication by water.<br/> A paper on the subject, written by himself,
                            may be seen in <a href="/people/dhosa1">Dr. Hosack<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a>'s
                            memoir of <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>He was a member of the Board appointed by the Legislature,<br/> in <date when="1810">1810</date>, to explore the route of an inland
                            navigation from the<br/>\<geogname key="hudsr">Hudson river</geogname>
                            to <geogname key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogname> and <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>; and he accom-<br/>panied the
                            commissioners on that tour of public duty. A copy<br/> of the first
                            published report on this subject, dated <date when="1811-02">February,<br/> 1811</date>, may be seen in the American Medical and
                            Philosophical<br/> Register. In common with <a href="/people/dclin1">Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, Morris, Pintard, and other<br/> advocates, for
                            the general organization of the canal policy at<br/> that early stage of
                            this great undertaking, odious imputations<br/> were freely bestowed
                            upon him and his compatriots, and with <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_026" n="31"></pb>them he was
                            assailed with the weapons of ridicule, by an opposi-<br/>tion thinly
                            scattered throughout the state, but strongly confede-<br/>rated in this
                            city. It was absurdly proclaimed that <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a><br/> would be utterly ruined by carrying into
                            effect the projected canal<br/> measures. Notwithstanding the
                            provocations were many and<br/> strong, he betrayed no evidences of
                            irritability or disquietude,<br/> but, like primitive <a href="/people/rbarc1">Barclay<persname key="rbarc1"></persname></a>, sustained himself with an
                            unshaken<br/> indifference, feeling assured that ignorance could not
                            long retain<br/> its usurped powers, and that rancour, the offspring of
                            party hatred<br/> and disappointed ambition, would in due time exhaust
                            itself by<br/> the force of its own venom.</p>
<p> Little need be said touching the scholastic acquisitions of Mr.<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>. All I believe he ever received
                            at school, was embraced in an<br/> English elementary education. He,
                            however, deeply studied the<br/> human character: as opportunities
                            occurred, he read on general<br/> subjects of life and letters. He was
                            versed in profane and eccle-<br/>siastical story, and might be deemed an
                            adept in Quaker annals,<br/> from the History of Sewall down to Sarah
                            Grub's Journal.<br/> Knowledge being higher prized for defence than
                            ornament, he<br/> turned his information in these matters to an
                            advantageous dex-<br/>terity, when he encountered, in his journey, that
                            marvellous im-<br/>postor of the Shakers, <a href="/people/jwilk1">Jemima
                                Wilkinson<persname key="jwilk1"></persname></a>, the elect lady, during<br/> his tour of
                            observation as canal commissioner in <date when="1810">1810</date>. He
                            often<br/> spoke of this incident with peculiar pleasure. His
                            researches<br/> in polemical disquisitions made him often deprecate the
                            folly and<br/> injurious tendency of sectarian controversy on religious
                            matters;<br/> and confirmed him in the excellence of the more salutary
                            influ-<br/>ence of the unsophisticated or orthodox doctrines, as he
                            termed<br/> them, of the Society of Friends. Though these were his
                            views,<br/> he felt that the intellectual culture of the Quakers was
                            behind<br/> that of many other religious communities; and I am
                            persuaded<br/> his desire to promote knowledge, made him often regret,
                            that<br/> while the society to which he belonged had every reason
                            to<br/> boast of its morality, philanthropy, and benevolence; it
                            neglected<br/> too much the important advantages arising from the
                            support of<br/> a literary order of men for the better education of its
                            youth.<br/> Sound knowledge, he would say, subdues idleness, and
                            prevents<br/> vacuity; and a disciplined mind enables the possessor to
                            conduct<br/> himself with greater safety in the right way. It will
                            readily be<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_027" n="32"></pb>allowed, that the ethics of Quakerism, while
                            they lead to the rejec-<br/>tion of speculative principles, tend to the
                            acquisition of practical<br/> facts ; and, however prone the mind may be
                            to theorize, it is some-<br/>what hard for theory to usurp an undue
                            influence over a Quaker<br/> judgment. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> might he fairly cited as an example, in<br/>
                            illustration of what is now advanced. Hence I account for his<br/>
                            indifference to works of fancy; poetry and prose were alike<br/> perused
                            by him for the solid instruction they imparted; and he<br/> read Dr.
                            Mitchill's translation of the piscatory stanzas of Sanna-<br/>zarius,
                            and the lofty strains of Dryden, with similar emotions.</p>
<p> No book of modern times stood so high in his estimation, as<br/> the
                            Letters on the Christian Religion, by Dr. Olinthus Gregory,<br/> and he
                            exerted his influence in the diffusion of that admirable<br/> work. As
                            his efforts in behalf of new plans, or modified pro-<br/>jects,
                            generally quadrated with the usefulness to be derived from<br/>
                            contemplated measures, he was in the constant habit of urging<br/> the
                            economical precepts and moral sayings of Franklin, which<br/> he often
                            embodied, as the soundest advice, in his confidential let-<br/>ters to
                            those of his young friends, for whom he cherished a par-<br/>ticular
                            regard. The intellectuality of Madame De Stael yielded<br/> him less
                            gratification than the expositions of Hannah More;<br/> and a higher
                            glow of feeling was enkindled in his breast by<br/> Rumford on Cookery
                            and Stoves, than by Burke on the Sublime<br/> and Beautiful. It is
                            almost superfluous to add, that you may re-<br/>gard him as a decided
                                <emph rend="italic">utilitarian</emph>.</p>
<p>Of the various societies with which he was associated, he was<br/> fairly
                            considered an operative member. Aware that business<br/> might be well
                            debated, and yet badly managed; he rarely spoke<br/> in a public body,
                            and when his opinions were demanded, he deli-<br/>vered his remarks with
                            plainness, brevity, and pertinency. In the<br/> social circle, his
                            conversation was more animated: as he had<br/> mixed largely with
                            different classes of mankind, and abounded<br/> in lively anecdotes, it
                            was often highly interesting. On occa-<br/>sions, he evinced a wholesome
                            intrepidity and an enlarged cha-<br/>rity; yet he wished every thing
                            congenerous with the practical,<br/> and he saw with little satisfaction
                            the diffusion of philippics<br/> against luxurious living among a people
                            subsisting mainly on<br/> the precarious tenure of the chase, and
                            tractates on extravagance<br/> in dress among those whose chief vesture
                            was a blanket. </p>

<p>I need not enlarge. I think you may safely assent to the
                            con-<br/>clusion, that the subject of your biography appropriated the
                            best<br/> years of a long life to the best purposes of man; that he may
                            be<br/> justly deemed enlightened, among a people whose frugal
                            views<br/> occasion perhaps too partial and too low an estimation of
                            intellec-<br/>tual acquirements; that he was eminently conspicuous in
                            a<br/> society deservedly regarded as excelling all others in works of
                            <br/>charity and philanthropy.</p>
<p> I am acquainted with but one striking instance in his whole life<br/> in
                            which the integrity of his judgment was seriously impugned:<br/> he was
                            unwittingly captivated by the enthusiasm which prevailed<br/> concerning
                            the metallic tractors, and was led to confide in the<br/> remedial
                            efficacy of Perkinism, by experiments instituted at the <br/><a href="/places/newyh">New York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, where that practice was
                            countenanced for a<br/> short while by certain of the physicians of that
                            charity. But<br/> little censure can rest with him on this particular
                            account: he<br/> was not educated a physician ; and this extraordinary
                            deception <br/>received the support of many eminent professional
                            characters, both<br/> in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> and
                            America, and indeed was not completely exploded<br/> as an unwarrantable
                            hypothesis until subjected to the clinical acu-<br/>men of <a href="/people/dhayg1">Dr. Haygarth<persname key="dhayg1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>A word or two on your inquiry relative to his son <a href="/people/jeddy1">John Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>.<br/> I refer you to a short memoir of him
                            printed in the American<br/> Monthly Magazine; more might have been said
                            of his know-<br/>ledge of the physical branches of science, than is
                            there recorded.<br/> He was a good zoologist, an excellent mineralogist,
                            and a minute<br/> botanist. His acquisitions in this last named
                            department were<br/> very remarkable. He was a member of the botanical
                            class when<br/> I attended Columbia College in <date when="1809">1809</date>-<date when="1810">10</date>. But it was requisite,<br/>
                            on account of his being a deaf-mute, that his studies should be<br/>
                            prosecuted privately by the intervention of signs and the manual<br/>
                            alphabet. He found a friend willing to give him the necessary<br/>
                            direction and aid, in his relative, the professor of Botany, <a href="/people/dhosa1">Dr. Hosack<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a>. By visible signs, instead
                            of accentible sounds, he mas-<br/>tered the Linnean system, and
                            subsequently became a practical<br/> botanist. He formed an herbarium of
                            some extent, of our indi-<br/>genous plants. The greater acuteness of
                            the surviving senses<br/> when one or more are destroyed, was verified
                            in the case of <a href="/people/jeddy1">JohnEddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>. His
                            industry was unintermitting, and his attainments <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_029" n="34"></pb>seemed
                            incredible to those who are unaware what intellectual<br/> power and
                            activity are occasionally displayed by persons to whom<br/> one sense is
                            shut out. The blind Rumphius, of <a href="/places/holla">Holland<placename key="holla"></placename></a>, is still<br/>recognized as conspicuous among
                            erudite botanical investigators;<br/> and <a href="/people/jeddy1">John
                                Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>, had his life been protracted, and he given an<br/>
                            exclusive attention to the same kind of studies, might have<br/> secured
                            to himself a permanent place in the catalogue of Ame-<br/>rican
                            botanists.</p>

                LIFE OF <a href="/people/teddy1">THOMAS EDDY<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>.

<p>AT no period in the history of nations has the mind<br/> of man been more active
                    in the great business of<br/> ameliorating his condition, than that which has
                    elap-<br/>sed since the close of the American revolution. Inven-<br/>tion,
                    industry, and enterprise, have been abroad, and<br/> multiplied conveniences,
                    comforts, and even elegan-<br/>cies, beyond enumeration. Nor has this been
                    all:<br/> Those charitable institutions, which are, at the same<br/> time, the
                    medicine for natural and moral evils, and the<br/> noble ornaments of civil
                    society, have every where been<br/> built up, but especially in this country;
                    and it<br/> is not too much to say, that, in many instances, our<br/>
                    institutions have become patterns for other nations,<br/> even those of the old
                    world, from which, in other<br/> things, we have taken so much in organizing
                    societies<br/> amongst ourselves. These institutions although of<br/> the first
                    importance to the public welfare, seem to lie<br/> out of the path of the
                    general historian, who contents<br/> himself with some cursory remarks upon them
                    as<br/> domestic matters, and goes on to battles, treaties,<br/> and political
                    occurrences, as making up all that is worthy <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_032" n="38"></pb>the attention of
                    the reader, or proper for his pen;<br/> and, it is singular, that the writers of
                    biography should<br/> have so seldom taken up the lives of philanthropists.<br/>
                    Almost every grade of society, and every adventurer,<br/> has been described,
                    while those who laboured for the<br/> good of mankind have been, with some few
                    excep-<br/>tions, neglected. The reading world have been sup-<br/>plied with
                    countless volumes written upon the deeds<br/> of warriors, who have desolated
                    nations, and marked<br/> their footsteps with blood. In the opinion of men,<br/>
                    they had conquered their fame:<br/>
<quote type="poem"> They were the mighty of the world,<br/> The demi-gods of earth;<br/>
                        Their breath—the flag of blood unfurled <br/>And gave the battle birth.<br/>
                        They lived—to trample on mankind,<br/> And in their ravage leave behind<br/>
                        The impress of <emph rend="italic">their</emph> worth.<br/> And wizzard
                        rhyme, and hoary song,<br/> Hallowed their deeds, and hymned their
                        wrong.</quote><br/>The statesmen and orators, as well as warriors, have<br/>
                    had their Plinys and their Plutarchs to hand them<br/> down to posterity in a
                    blaze of glory; and even the<br/> poets who were neglected while living, have
                    had their<br/> Cibbers and Johnsons to tell the world how they suf-<br/>fered
                    and how they sung; while the philanthropist,<br/> whose deeds have an influence
                    on the moral world,<br/> as the dews of heaven have upon the natural, has<br/>
                    hardly found a poet or historian. Not even a name<br/> has been left on record
                    for the good Samaritan. In<br/> a few instances, it is true, genius and feeling
                    have<br/> burst out into a sweet strain of honest eulogy of the<br/> benevolent,
                    such as will never be forgotten. Pope's<br/> tuneful tribute to the Man of Ross,
                    and Burke's<br/> eloquent description of <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>, can never be lost.<br/> Some, in modern times, have
                    sketched the lives of a<br/> few philanthropists, but frequently in so tame a
                    man-<br/>ner, that one would think that there was a canon<br/> against showing
                    the slightest enthusiasm in com-<br/>memorating the good. Some few have broken
                    through<br/> their shackles, and dared to assign them a place in the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_033" n="39"></pb>history of man, and to say to these doers of good in<br/> a spirit
                    of prophecy,<br/>
<quote type="poem">Thine was an empire o'er distress;<br/> Thy triumph—of the
                        mind;<br/> To burst the bonds of wretchedness,<br/> The friend of human
                        kind:<br/> Thy name—through every future age,<br/> By bard, philanthropist,
                        and sage,<br/> In glory shall be shrined.</quote>
<br/>But these honest chroniclers have as yet had no chance<br/> with the
                    delineators of warriors and statesmen, who<br/> had astonished, awed, and
                    charmed mankind. It is<br/> believed that a day of better taste is dawning
                    upon<br/> us, and that men will take as much pleasure in tra-<br/>cing the rise
                    and progress of an asylum for the chil-<br/>dren of poverty and disease, as in
                    recounting a battle <br/>in which thousands were made miserable, and which<br/>
                    created many orphans at a blow.</p>
<p>Promiscuous charity has been practised by the<br/> kind-hearted and the wealthy
                    in every age and nation.<br/> The benevolent have poured the oil and wine
                    into<br/> the wounds of the unfortunate, to assuage their<br/> anguish, if they
                    could not heal them; they have fed<br/> the hungry and clothed the naked, and in
                    so doing<br/> have received their reward in the blessings of the<br/> just. The
                    Saviour of the world declared that, inas-<br/>much as this was done to one of
                    the children of<br/> misfortune, it was done unto himself. But
                    notwith-<br/>standing this generous current of philanthropy has<br/> been
                    flowing in the hearts of the virtuous, in all<br/> nations, since the birth of
                    man, yet it was left for a<br/> late age to collect facts relative to human
                    misery, and<br/> from these to form a system for permanent relief.<br/> In
                    former times, charity seemed to pour out her heart<br/> like water, but never to
                    consult reason upon the true<br/> means of preventing the evils she mourned. In
                    this<br/> age she has called in industry, sagacity, perseverance,<br/> and the
                    highest order of invention, to assist her in<br/> her great undertakings.</p>
<p> Prisons, in every age and nation, have been viewed <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_034" n="40"></pb> with horror
                    by the great mass of the people; their<br/> bars and gates and chains have been
                    so intimately<br/> associated with crime and infamy, that the blood<br/> curdled
                    at the very thought of them, and the shortest<br/> confinement was a lasting
                    disgrace; and no wonder,<br/> for within the four walls, and frequently in the
                    same<br/> room, the murderer, the thief, the insane, and the<br/> honest debtor,
                    mingled their wailings, and breathed<br/> the same tainted atmosphere. It seemed
                    as if the<br/> powerful and the benevolent were paralyzed in con-<br/>templating
                    these evils, and thought the slightest<br/> remedy was beyond all hope. They
                    could do some-<br/>thing to soften the miseries of the individual, but
                    dared<br/> not combat the prejudices of the age, nor attempt to<br/> form a
                    general system to reach a class of cases.</p>
<p> About the middle of the last century, a philanthro-<br/>pist arose in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, who gave a new direction to<br/> the alms of
                    individuals, to the sympathy of communi-<br/>ties, and to the charity of
                    nations. This philanthro-<br/>pist was <a href="/people/jhowa1">John
                        Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>.* <note rend="asterisk">* See Appendix.</note> He was a
                    man of strict<br/> habits, of daring courage, both natural and moral.<br/> He
                    began, as it was then considered, a crusade of<br/> charity. He examined the
                    state of all the prisons in<br/>
<a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a>, and then extended his researches<br/> through the
                    continent. He made known his disco-<br/>veries to the grand inquest of the
                    British nation, the<br/> House of Commons. This august body heard the<br/>
                    relation with surprise, and set about turning the infor-<br/>mation they had
                    gained to alleviating miseries, which<br/> until then had appeared as among
                    legendary tales<br/> or incurable evils. <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> was still indefatigable<br/> in his new pathway of glory,
                    and at last fell a martyr<br/> to his zeal in the cause, on the banks of the
                    Euxine.<br/> His exertions, however, were so bold and novel, as to<br/> excite
                    general attention, and to give a new impulse<br/> to the charitable dispositions
                    of the human mind.<br/> He was indeed born for the universe, and the effects
                    of<br/> his exertions are pervading the whole of Christendom. </p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_035" n="41"></pb>
<p>America has been so intimately connected with<br/>
<a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> in science and letters, that all that
                    has been<br/> done in that country, was soon known in this, and<br/> has
                    generally been imitated, when found to be good;<br/> at first, by small
                    beginnings, which were, from time<br/> to time, increased and improved, as
                    information and<br/> wealth advanced. The privations and sufferings of<br/> a
                    new people, taught them to be kind to one another,<br/> and gave them the habits
                    as well as the spirit of<br/> benevolence. It might, of course, have been
                    expected<br/> by the patriot and philosopher, that <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> would<br/> have a school in America. This school has
                    been<br/> established.</p>
<p> One of the most distinguished disciples of this<br/> university of charity, was
                        <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, a merchant<br/> of the city
                    of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. He was born about the<br/>
                    period that <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> began to mark out his
                    course of<br/> action. <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> not only made this
                    great philanthro-<br/>pist his pattern, but he carried his reasonings
                    farther<br/> than <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> had an opportunity to
                    do. Seizing the<br/> facts and reasonings which <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> had furnished,<br/> he added others, truly his own, and
                    set about to<br/> influence his fellow citizens to make practical efforts<br/>
                    to test the correctness of his views, and the sound-<br/>ness of his principles;
                    and such was his success, that<br/> he, by general consent, received the
                    appellation of<br/> the <said who="undetermined"><a href="/people/jhowa1">HOWARD<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> OF AMERICA.</said> Some notice of the life,<br/>
                    writings, and deeds of such a man, it is believed, will<br/> not only be
                    acceptable, but useful to the public, as<br/> an incentive to like efforts, and
                    as a satisfactory proof<br/> of what can be done among men by one
                    individual<br/> of intelligence, virtue, and moral courage.</p>
<p> If, in later life, it is difficult for a man to speak of<br/> himself and his
                    deeds, particularly, if he has been<br/> called to take a conspicuous part on
                    the stage of<br/>action; still, that autobiography of such a man which
                    <br/>recounts the deeds and trials of childhood and youth,<br/>and so far into
                    manhood as to come up to the time<br/> when distinction commences, is always the
                    best, when <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_036" n="42"></pb>it can be obtained. Fortunately, a plain,
                    modest,<br/> and well written account of the early days of <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, has been left from his own hand.
                    It was only<br/> intended for the eye of his family and particular<br/> friends,
                    but the narrative is so happy, that it would<br/> be over fastidious indeed to
                    hesitate to use it on this<br/> occasion. It is almost impossible for a
                    biographer,<br/>even with every aid before him, to describe the true<br/> growth
                    and development of a mind, from the cradle to<br/> maturity. The individual
                    himself can alone approx-<br/>imate to the truth. In childhood and youth,
                    when<br/> the imagination wanders at will, none but the per-<br/>son himself can
                    tell all the avenues and directions of<br/> thought, nor precisely when passion
                    was commingled<br/> with judgment, or by what food and exercise the<br/> mind
                    obtained its stature. I shall, as the best thing<br/> that can be done for my
                    readers, introduce an extract,<br/> in Mr. Eddy's own words, giving an account
                    of him-<br/>self up to the time he began his effectual efforts as<br/> a
                    philanthropist:—</p>

<p>I can only trace my ancestors as far back as my<br/> grandfather,
                                <a href="/people/jedie1">John Edie<persname key="jedie1"></persname></a>, (by a letter I have
                            seen from<br/> him to my father, he so spelled his name,) who lived in<br/>
<a href="/places/belfa">Belfast<placename key="belfa"></placename></a>, in <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, but he probably came from Aberdeen,<br/> in
                                <a href="/places/scot">Scotland<placename key="scot"></placename></a>. He was much respected
                            and esteemed<br/> as a remarkably upright honest man—he was in low<br/>
                            circumstances, and only able to give my father a small<br/> portion of
                            school learning. My father, <a href="/people/jeddy2">James
                            Eddy<persname key="jeddy2"></persname></a>,<br/> was born in <a href="/places/belfa">Belfast<placename key="belfa"></placename></a>, <date when="1712">1712</date>; he served an
                            apprenticeship<br/> to <a href="/people/wsinc1">William
                                Sinclair<persname key="wsinc1"></persname></a>, a respectable merchant in <a href="/places/dubli">Dublin<placename key="dubli"></placename></a>.<br/> My mother's name was <a href="/people/mdarr1">Mary Darragh<persname key="mdarr1"></persname></a>; she was born<br/> in
                                <a href="/places/dubli">Dublin<placename key="dubli"></placename></a> about <date when="1724">l724</date>; she was of a respectable and good<br/> family. My
                            parents were married in <a href="/places/dubli">Dublin<placename key="dubli"></placename></a> about
                            the<br/> year <date when="1742">1742</date>. She had a fortune of about
                            £1000 sterling.<br/> I believe soon after their marriage, they removed to<br/>
<a href="/places/belfa">Belfast<placename key="belfa"></placename></a>, and there my father pursued
                            mercantile busi-<br/>ness. They had both been educated
                            Presbyterians,<br/> but during their residence in that city, he
                            became<br/> acquainted with <a href="/people/rbrad1">Robert
                                Bradshaw<persname key="rbrad1"></persname></a>, a Friend, of consi<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_037" n="43"></pb>derable
                            estate, who resided at Newtonards, about seven<br/> miles from
                                <a href="/places/belfa">Belfast<placename key="belfa"></placename></a>, and was highly respected
                            and<br/> much beloved. He was not a minister, but a meeting<br/> was
                            held at his house, which was occasionally attend-<br/>ed by some of his
                            tenants. He lent my father some<br/> Friend's books, who in this way
                            became acquainted<br/> with their principles, and was received as a
                            member<br/> in the society. My mother was warmly attached to the<br/>
                            Presbyterians, and much prejudiced against the doc-<br/>trines and
                            principles of Friends; however, she after-<br/>wards became convinced of
                            their rectitude, and was<br/> received into membership. She was a pious
                            and valua-<br/>ble woman. About the year <date when="1753">1753</date>,
                            they embarked for<br/> America, and landed and settled at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. My<br/> father pursued
                            mercantile business, mostly in shipping,<br/> till about <date when="1766">1766</date>, when he went into the ironmongery<br/>
                            business. He died in <date when="1766-09">9th month</date>. My mother
                            had six-<br/>teen children, of whom none are now living, but my<br/>
                            sister, <a href="/people/mhosa1">Mary Hosack<persname key="mhosa1"></persname></a>, and myself. She
                            was only a few<br/> months old at the time of our father's decease. I
                            was<br/> born in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, <date when="1758-09-05">5th of 9th month, 1758</date>. My<br/> mother
                            carried on the hardware business extensively<br/> after my father's
                            death, till the year <date when="1796">1796</date>, when she<br/>
                            removed to <a href="/places/bucki">Buckingham<placename key="bucki"></placename></a>, in <a href="/places/bucks">Bucks county<placename key="bucks"></placename></a>. She was<br/> induced to quit
                            the city on account of the bitter spi-<br/>rit of persecution of the
                            Whigs (the advocates of<br/> American independence) against the Tories,
                            (so call-<br/>ed on account of their attachment to the mother<br/>
                            country;) and our family being of the latter descrip-<br/>tion, we
                            suffered considerably from the opposite par-<br/>ty. Schools were then
                            badly conducted, and many<br/> of them broken up, on account of the
                            teachers being<br/> Tories, so that I had but a poor chance of getting
                            an<br/> education. All the learning I acquired was reading,<br/>
                            writing, and arithmetic, as far as vulgar fractions.<br/> As to grammar,
                            I could repeat some of its definitions<br/> by rote, but was totally
                            ignorant of its principles.<br/> About the year <date when="1771">1771</date>, my mother placed me as an ap-<br/>prentice with
                                <a href="/people/jhosk1">John Hoskins<persname key="jhosk1"></persname></a>, of <a href="/places/burli">Burlington<placename key="burli"></placename></a>, to learn<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_038" n="44"></pb>the
                            tanning business, but owing to some misunder-<br/>standing about my
                            learning the currying trade, I<br/> did not continue with him more than
                            two years.<br/> Public affairs were in a very unsettled state, and<br/>
                            a great deal of bitterness and ill-will subsisted<br/> amongst the
                            people, which produced much division<br/> and strife between families
                            and near connexions,<br/> who had heretofore lived in perfect peace and
                            har-<br/>mony. The science of government was little under-<br/>stood,
                            yet every bustling politician was a great man.<br/> Many of the most
                            respectable citizens were opposed<br/> to a separation from Great
                            Britain, yet all acknow-<br/>ledged that the claims of the British
                            Parliament<br/> were severe and unjust. Those opposed to
                            indepen-<br/>dence conceived that more ought to have been done<br/>to
                            obtain redress of grievances in a peaceable way,<br/> without having
                            recourse to the shedding of blood.<br/> Every one seemed to take a
                            decided and warm part,<br/> and was attached, and marked as belonging to
                            one<br/> or other of the two parties. It now appears very<br/> clearly
                            to my mind, that it would have been more<br/> wise and consistent with
                            the principles of Friends, if<br/> they had more carefully avoided the
                            intemperate<br/> political zeal, then manifested by all parties.
                            The<br/> advice of George Fox, was for Friends to keep out<br/> of all
                            civil commotions, &amp;c., as they are mostly car-<br/>ried on in a
                            temper very opposite to the meek and<br/> quiet spirit of the Gospel.
                            From the age of 16 to 20<br/> years, my most particular and intimate
                            friends were<br/>
<a href="/people/cmiff1">Charles Mifflin<persname key="cmiff1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savary<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>, with whom I<br/> daily
                            associated. The former was well educated<br/> and of a fine
                            understanding, with sound principles<br/> and a marked integrity. The
                            latter was a most<br/> valuable character, and a highly pleasing and
                            enter-<br/>taining companion. We were all fond of such sub-<br/>jects
                            and pursuits as were most likely to promote<br/> mirth and pleasantry,
                            yet the wise and excellent<br/> sentiments communicated to us by
                                <a href="/people/cmiff1">Charles Mifflin<persname key="cmiff1"></persname></a><br/> were one
                            means of preserving us from much harm;<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_039" n="45"></pb>and happy would
                            it have been for me, if I had,<br/> through life, more imitated his
                            excellent character.<br/> He possessed fine literary talents, and as a
                            poet was<br/> pleasing and instructive. His family connexions<br/> were
                            wealthy, and generally fashionable. He, more<br/> particularly, during
                            the latter part of his life, was a<br/> truly religious and good man. Of
                                <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savary<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>,<br/> it would be
                            difficult for me to say too much. No<br/> two persons could entertain a
                            more near and tender<br/> regard and affection for each other, than
                            always<br/> subsisted between us. He was a man of uncommon-<br/>ly
                            strong mind, and good understanding. When<br/> about 25 years of age, he
                            became a minister, and per-<br/>haps there never was one more highly
                            esteemed and<br/> beloved. He was admired by all classes, and
                            openly<br/> opposed to every thing in the least marked with<br/> bigotry
                            or superstition. As a preacher, he was in<br/> the first rank. His
                            manner of delivery was pleasing<br/> and solemn, his mind was cultivated
                            and improved,<br/> and he was uncommonly liberal in his sentiments<br/>
                            towards those of other societies. I have often thought<br/> there never
                            was so nearly perfect a character, within<br/> my knowledge, in our
                            society, and none that more<br/> extensively inculcated and effectually
                            diffused, true,<br/> practical, Christian principles. I could do no
                            less<br/> than pay this brief tribute to the memory of these<br/> two
                            excellent men, who were the friends of my<br/> youth, and who early
                            instilled into my mind, opi-<br/>nions and sentiments, that have been
                            instructive and<br/> useful to me through life.</p>
<p>In <date when="1777">1777</date>, the British troops took possession of
                                <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and soon
                            after their entering the city, the<br/> American army attacked them at
                                <a href="/places/germa">Germantown<placename key="germa"></placename></a>. I<br/> rode out with
                                <a href="/people/wsave1">William Savary<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a> to that place,
                            before<br/> the battle was entirely over, and had a view, a
                            mourn-<br/>ful view, of the killed and wounded on the ground.<br/> When
                            we arrived, the Americans had retreated, and<br/> the British army had
                            advanced as far as <a href="/places/chehi">Chesnut Hill<placename key="chehi"></placename></a>.
                            About a month previous to the arrival of the <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_040" n="46"></pb>British in
                                <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, a number of
                            Friends, amongst<br/> whom was my elder brother <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a>, were arrested by<br/> a general warrant, by
                            order of the <a href="/organizations/excop">Executive Council of
                                Pennsylvania<orgname key="excop"></orgname></a>, and without being admitted to a<br/>
                            hearing, were unjustly banished to <a href="/places/winch">Winchester<placename key="winch"></placename></a>, in<br/> Virginia. Of this number, I
                            recollect the names of<br/>
<a href="/people/ipemb1">Israel<persname key="ipemb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jpemb2">John<persname key="jpemb2"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/jpemb1">James
                                Pemberton<persname key="jpemb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/epeni1">Edward
                                Pening-ton<persname key="epeni1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/tfish1">Thomas<persname key="tfish1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/sfish1">Samuel<persname key="sfish1"></persname></a>, and
                                <a href="/people/mfish1">Myers Fisher<persname key="mfish1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/tgilp1">Thomas Gilpin<persname key="tgilp1"></persname></a>, and others. The alleged
                            charge against them<br/> was, that they were unfriendly to the
                            independence<br/> of America. They were absent several months, and<br/>
                            were allowed to return, during the time the British<br/> occupied the
                            city. The British army evacuated<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> in <date when="1778-06">6th month, 1778</date>. Soon after, several<br/> persons were
                            arrested, under a charge of aiding the<br/> British, and were tried for
                            treason. As is common<br/> in all civil wars, the minds of people were
                            extremely<br/> irritated against each other, and those who were<br/>
                            attached to the British government, were often very<br/> bitterly
                            persecuted by the opposite party. Amongst <br/>those citizens of
                            Philadelphia charged with treason,<br/> were <a href="/people/jrobe1">John
                                Roberts<persname key="jrobe1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/acarl1">Abraham
                                Carlisle<persname key="acarl1"></persname></a>. They<br/> were both Friends of good reputation,
                            and very<br/> respectable men. The former was a miller, and
                            resi-<br/>ded near <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a> meeting
                            house, about six miles from<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. The latter was a board
                            merchant,<br/> near Vine street. The charge against <a href="/people/jrobe1">Roberts<persname key="jrobe1"></persname></a> was,<br/> that when the British
                            troops were on their march to<br/> take possession of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and had advanced<br/> near
                            Swedes Ford, on the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname>, 17
                            miles from<br/> the city, he sent word to <a href="/people/whowe1">General
                                Howe<persname key="whowe1"></persname></a>, who com-<br/>manded the British, that the Friends,
                            who, as afore-<br/>mentioned, had been banished to <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, were then<br/> proceeding on the
                            road to <a href="/places/readi">Reading<placename key="readi"></placename></a>, and suggested
                            to<br/> the <a href="/people/whowe1">General<persname key="whowe1"></persname></a> that he should
                            send a detachment of the<br/> army to fall in with them, in order that
                            they might<br/> return to their families. After the British took
                            pos-<br/>session of the city, a line of fortifications was
                            com-<br/>pleted from the <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> to
                            the <geogname key="delaw">Delaware</geogname>, and<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_041" n="47"></pb>gates
                            were placed at different parts of this line. At<br/> one of these gates,
                                <a href="/people/acarl1">Abraham Carlisle<persname key="acarl1"></persname></a> was stationed
                            by<br/> direction of <a href="/people/whowe1">General Howe<persname key="whowe1"></persname></a>, in
                            order to examine all<br/> who went out of the city, or came into it, and
                            it was<br/> made his duty to stop any suspicious persons. This<br/>
                            constituted the charge exhibited against him. They<br/> were both tried
                            by <a href="/people/jmcke1">Judge McKean<persname key="jmcke1"></persname></a>, condemned to be<br/>
                            hanged, and were accordingly executed. <a href="/people/jrobe1">John
                                Robert<persname key="jrobe1"></persname></a>'s funeral was at <a href="/places/merio">Merion<placename key="merio"></placename></a>, on which occasion<br/> a meeting was held,
                            which was very large. He was<br/> extensively known, and much beloved.
                                <a href="/people/nwaln1">Nicholas Waln<persname key="nwaln1"></persname></a>, and others,
                            preached, and I attended, as did a<br/> large number from the city.
                                <a href="/people/acarl1">Abraham Carlisle<persname key="acarl1"></persname></a> was<br/> interred
                            in Friend's burial ground in Fourth street;<br/> his funeral, also, was
                            very large. When the British<br/> troops evacuated <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, my brother <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a><br/> removed to <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and in <date when="1779-04">4th
                                month, 1779</date>, 1 also<br/> left my native city and came by land
                            to <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.<br/> At this period it
                            was very dangerous travelling with-<br/>out a passport. I was put over
                            to <a href="/places/stati">Staten Island<placename key="stati"></placename></a> (pos-<br/>sessed by
                            the British troops) at night, and next day<br/> reached <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. My brother <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a> had, some<br/> time before, sailed for
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>. I had sold my<br/> horse
                            at <a href="/places/rahwa">Rahway<placename key="rahwa"></placename></a>, and had only ninety-six
                            dollars on<br/> my reaching <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,
                            where I was totally a stran-<br/>ger, and as to a knowledge of any kind
                            of business,<br/> entirely ignorant. My school learning, as I have
                            be-<br/>fore mentioned, was very limited, so that, of course,<br/> I had
                            to encounter many difficulties, and laboured<br/> under great
                            disadvantage in my attempts to acquire<br/> a sufficiency to defray my
                            expenses. I took board<br/> with <a href="/people/wback1">William
                                Backhouse<persname key="wback1"></persname></a>, in the house now occupied<br/> by <a href="/people/dmcco1">Daniel McCormick<persname key="dmcco1"></persname></a> in Wall street, at the rate
                            of<br/>eight dollars per week, besides having to pay one<br/> dollar
                            weekly for washing; <a href="/people/selai1">Samuel Elain<persname key="selai1"></persname></a>, late of<br/>
<a href="/places/newpo">Newport<placename key="newpo"></placename></a>, deceased, <a href="/people/jglov1">John I. Glover<persname key="jglov1"></persname></a>, and two or three<br/> other
                            respectable merchants, boarded at the same<br/> house; becoming
                            acquainted with them was highly<br/> useful to me, as it was the first
                            opportunity I had<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_042" n="48"></pb>ever had of acquiring a knowledge of
                            commerce,<br/> and the course of mercantile dealing. I knew that<br/> it
                            was out of my power to support myself with what<br/> I then possessed,
                            and that I must soon come to want,<br/> unless I could succeed in
                            business. The first thing<br/> to which my attention was turned, was
                            daily to<br/> attend auctions at the Coffee House, and being
                            sen-<br/>sible of my own ignorance, I endeavoured by every<br/> means in
                            my power to acquire information—care-<br/>fully inquiring of others the
                            names of articles ex-<br/>posed for public sale, as it often happened
                            that I was<br/> not even acquainted with the names of many of<br/> them,
                            I then inquired their value, and advised with<br/> some persons previous
                            to purchasing; sometimes on<br/> noticing an article intended to be sold
                            by auction, I<br/> would procure a sample, and call on some dealer
                            in<br/> the article, and get them to offer me a fixed price on<br/> my
                            furnishing it: in this way, by first ascertaining<br/> where I could
                            dispose of the goods, I would purchase,<br/> provided the price would
                            afford me a profit. On this<br/>plan I have found a purchaser for goods,
                            bought and<br/> delivered them, and received the money which
                            ena-<br/>bled me to pay the auctioneer the cost of them, with-<br/>out
                            my advancing one shilling. I was obliged to<br/>live by my wits, and
                            this necessity was of great use<br/> to me afterwards. Some months after
                            my arrival at<br/>
<a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, my brother <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a> arrived from <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>,<br/> and brought with him, on account of
                            merchants there,<br/> provisions, linens, &amp;c. shipped from
                                <a href="/places/dubli">Dublin<placename key="dubli"></placename></a>, Cork,<br/>
<a href="/places/belfa">Belfast<placename key="belfa"></placename></a>, and other ports. He returned
                            to <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> in<br/>
<date when="1780">1780</date>, previous to which we formed a
                            copartnership<br/> with <a href="/people/bsyke1">Benjamin
                            Sykes<persname key="bsyke1"></persname></a>, under the firm of Eddy, Sykes, &amp; Co.</p>
<p> This firm prosecuted business mostly in consign-<br/>ments from
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, and some shipping<br/> business. My partner
                            was a good natured honest<br/> Englishman, but not possessed of a very
                            intelligent,<br/> active mind; in consequence of this, the
                            management<br/> and contrivance of the business fell to my lot, and,
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_043" n="49"></pb>though very young, and without experience, I
                            had<br/> to write all the letters, and carry on every kind
                            of<br/>correspondence, besides mostly making all the pur-<br/>chases and
                            sales. By every packet we had to write<br/> twenty or thirty letters to
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, and<br/> to accomplish this, had frequently to
                            sit writing till<br/> 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. I was
                            sedulously<br/> and actively employed in business, and in this way<br/>
                            acquired considerable knowledge of commercial af-<br/>fairs. Our
                            concerns were extensive, and were prose-<br/>cuted with tolerable
                            success, respectability, and repu-<br/>tation. My brother <a href="/people/geddy1">George<persname key="geddy1"></persname></a> was, at this time, in<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, about 18 years of age.
                            He possessed a<br/> remarkably sensible and comprehensive mind.
                            Al-<br/>though he had no knowledge of business, he was<br/> full of
                            enterprise. By him, in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                            and by<br/> Eddy, Sykes &amp; Co. in <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, an arrangement<br/> was made, with the consent of
                                <a href="/people/gwash1">General Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>,<br/> to supply
                            the British and foreign troops with money,<br/> who were taken with
                                <a href="/people/ccorn1">Lord Cornwallis<persname key="ccorn1"></persname></a> at <a href="/places/yorkt">York Town<placename key="yorkt"></placename></a>. The money was raised by my
                            brother at<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, drawing on us at
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and the<br/>monies thus
                            raised were paid to the Paymaster of<br/> the British and foreign
                            troops, prisoners at <a href="/people/lanca">Lancas-ter<persname key="lanca"></persname></a>,
                                <a href="/people/penns">Pennsylvania<persname key="penns"></persname></a>, for which he received
                            and sent to<br/> Eddy, Sykes &amp; Co. that Paymaster's drafts on
                            the<br/> Paymaster General at <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. By an agreement<br/> made with <a href="/people/hclin1">Sir Henry Clinton<persname key="hclin1"></persname></a>, the British
                            commander,<br/> we were paid six per cent. commission. The whole<br/>
                            amount paid amounted to a very large sum, and<br/> proved a profitable
                            contract.</p>
<p>After being some time in business, I kept house in<br/> John street. My
                            most intimate friends, at this time,<br/> were <a href="/people/rhart1">Richard<persname key="rhart1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/lhart1">Lawrence
                                Hartshorne<persname key="lhart1"></persname></a>. I had<br/> formed some acquaintance with
                                <a href="/people/lhart1">Lawrence Harts-horne<persname key="lhart1"></persname></a>'s sister
                            previous to my coming to <a href="/places/nycit">New
                            York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,<br/> and then experienced a tender and warm
                            attachment<br/> towards her, and about a year after my coming to<br/>
<a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, I went down to <a href="/places/sandh">Sandy Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a> in company <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_044" n="50"></pb>with
                                <a href="/people/lhart1">Lawrence Hartshorne<persname key="lhart1"></persname></a>, whose object
                            in attempt-<br/>ing this dangerous enterprise was to visit his
                            parents,<br/> whilst mine was to obtain an interview with his<br/>
                            sister. In the evening, we immediately ventured on<br/> shore, and went
                            to his father's, who resided on his<br/> farm at Black Point. The family
                            were all in bed,<br/> and we were thus disappointed in seeing any
                            of<br/> them. <a href="/people/lhart1">Lawrence<persname key="lhart1"></persname></a> was advised by
                            his father to return<br/> immediately to <a href="/places/sandh">Sandy
                                Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>, as there was reason to<br/> suspect that parties
                            of the militia were then near the<br/> premises. We accordingly went to
                            the river side,<br/> and taking a small canoe, pushed off in hopes
                            of<br/> getting safe to the <a href="/places/sandh">Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>; it
                            was moonlight, and as<br/> we kept off some distance from the shore, we
                            did<br/> not apprehend danger till we should reach the Gut<br/> (as it
                            was called) which separated <a href="/places/sandh">Sandy
                                Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a> from<br/> the Highlands. This was very narrow, so
                            that we <br/>were obliged to pass within a little distance of the<br/>
<geogname key="jshor">Jersey shore</geogname>. There were stationed
                            about thirty of<br/> the Jersey militia, and a number of them fired on
                            us.<br/> We laid ourselves on our backs in the bottom of the<br/> canoe,
                            and some of the balls went through the sides,<br/> immediately over our
                            bodies. Finding we could not<br/> escape, we rowed to the shore, and
                            surrendered our-<br/>selves prisoners. At first, they treated us
                            harshly,<br/> searched us, and took from us some articles of small<br/>
                            value. In the morning they marched us to <a href="/places/middl">Middle-town<placename key="middl"></placename></a>, and then to <a href="/places/monmo">Monmouth<placename key="monmo"></placename></a> Court-house, where we<br/> were taken before
                                <a href="/people/jsymm1">Judge Symmes<persname key="jsymm1"></persname></a> (the father of
                                <br/><a href="/people/csymm1">Capt. Symmes<persname key="csymm1"></persname></a>) and committed
                            to prison. We were<br/> put in a small room, about six or seven feet
                            square,<br/> in which we found four or five prisoners, some of <br/>whom
                            had been confined there some time. We were<br/> much crowded, and had
                            nothing to lie on but ex-<br/>tremely dirty straw, which I believe had
                            not been<br/> changed since the other prisoners had occupied the<br/>
                            room. On first entering this miserable dungeon, the<br/> stench
                            occasioned by foul and noxious air exceedingly<br/> alarmed me, and it
                            was strongly fixed on my mind<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_045" n="51"></pb>that it would put an end
                            to my life in less than half<br/> an hour. However, in time, it did not
                            feel so very<br/> offensive, and becoming habituated to it, I was
                            able<br/> to eat my meals with a good appetite.</p>
<p>
<a href="/people/eboud1">Elisha Boudinot<persname key="eboud1"></persname></a> (now President of the
                                <a href="/organizations/ambib"> American Bible Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>) was
                            then commissary of prisoners;<br/> I consulted with him, and he behaved
                            very friendly<br/> towards me. One day, it was reported that a
                            woman<br/>had offered to swear that she had seen me, a short<br/> time
                            before this, at <a href="/places/newbr">New Brunswick<placename key="newbr"></placename></a>. This
                            was false,<br/> as I had not been out of <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> for more than a<br/> year. It was said, if she
                            would swear I was there,<br/> it would enable them to prove me a spy.
                            This served,<br/> of course, to alarm me extremely; however, in a
                            little<br/> time, no more was said about it. We remained in<br/> this
                            loathsome place about eight or ten days, and<br/> were then removed to
                                <a href="/places/sprin">Springfield<placename key="sprin"></placename></a>, six miles from<br/>
<a href="/places/eliza">Elizabethtown<placename key="eliza"></placename></a>. At <a href="/places/sprin">Springfield<placename key="sprin"></placename></a>, we had the liberty<br/>of a
                            mile round the village, and in about a month,<br/> were exchanged for, I
                            believe, two soldiers of the<br/> militia, and returned safe to our
                            friends in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.<br/> Soon after
                            this, <a href="/people/heddy1">Hannah Hartshorne<persname key="heddy1"></persname></a> came to the
                            city<br/> on a visit to her brother, which afforded me frequent<br/>
                            opportunities of being in her company, and resulted<br/> in our forming
                            an affectionate and lasting attach-<br/>ment towards each other. We were
                            married on the<br/><date when="1782-03-20">twentieth of 3d month,
                                1782</date>, at the old Meeting<br/> House in Liberty street. I
                            continued in business till<br/> peace was concluded in <date when="1783">1783</date>, and in the <date when="1783-11">11th month</date><br/>
                            of that year, the British troops evacuated the city.<br/> This was a
                            trying period to myself, and others, who<br/> had taken refuge in
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, as all persons of
                            our<br/> description had thereby incurred the ill-will of those<br/> of
                            the opposite party, and we much feared that we<br/> should be
                            exceedingly persecuted by them. Great<br/> numbers went to <a href="/places/novas">Nova Scotia<placename key="novas"></placename></a>, and amongst others,<br/> my
                            brother in law, <a href="/people/lhart1">Lawrence Hartshorne<persname key="lhart1"></persname></a>,
                            and his<br/> family. I could not reconcile leaving my mother and<br/>
                            near connexions in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and
                            this considera- <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_046" n="52"></pb>tion prevented my removing to
                                <a href="/places/halif2">Halifax<placename key="halif2"></placename></a>. It may now<br/> appear
                            strange, that persons born in America, should<br/> have been opposed to
                            American independence. It is,<br/> however, not surprising, that among
                            the great body of<br/> the people, who were all born and educated <emph rend="italic">British<br/> subjects</emph>, that many deep-rooted
                            prejudices should<br/> exist, tending to excite an attachment to that
                            govern-<br/>ment, and an aversion to republicanism.</p>
<p>These were sensible of the unjust and tyrannical<br/> conduct of Great
                            Britain towards this country, but<br/> they conceived redress of
                            grievances might be ob-<br/>tained without a separation.</p>
<p>This, as events proved, was a vain expectation. In<br/> truth, the
                            science of government was not then so well<br/> understood as at
                            present, and great numbers, having<br/> the knowledge they now possess,
                            would then have<br/> adopted very different political sentiments.
                            This<br/> would certainly have been the fact as regards myself.<br/>
                            Before the Americans entered the city, I removed to<br/>
<a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>, and soon after to
                                <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. My<br/> brother
                                <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a> was married and in
                            business in <a href="/places/lond">Lon-don<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, and I formed
                            a connexion in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                            un-<br/>der the firm of <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> and
                                <a href="/people/geddy1">George Eddy<persname key="geddy1"></persname></a>. In the<br/>
<date when="1784-01">first month of 1784</date>, I went to <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a> for the pur-<br/>pose of purchasing
                            and making shipments of tobacco.<br/> It was a most remarkably severe
                            winter, and I recol-<br/>lect when riding near <a href="/places/proya">Port-Royal<placename key="proya"></placename></a> on the <geogname key="rappa">Rappahanock<br/> river</geogname>, that the snow along the fences
                            (drifted) was<br/> six feet deep. The winter in <date when="1780-01">1st
                                month, 1780</date>, was,<br/> however, much more severe. All the bay
                            of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> was then frozen, for
                            some weeks, as far as <a href="/places/sandh">San-dy
                                Hook<placename key="sandh"></placename></a>. Horses and sleighs passed from the city<br/> to
                                <a href="/places/stati">Staten Island<placename key="stati"></placename></a>. I remember seeing
                            a number of<br/> large cannon, 42 pounders, taken on the ice from<br/>
<a href="/places/paulu">Paulus' Hook<placename key="paulu"></placename></a> or <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/stati">Staten
                                Island<placename key="stati"></placename></a>. Great<br/> numbers of people were daily skating
                            on the bay. I<br/> went on skates to <a href="/places/gover">Governor's
                                Island<placename key="gover"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/bedlo">Bedlow's
                                Island<placename key="bedlo"></placename></a>,<br/> and <a href="/places/paulu">Paulus'
                                Hook<placename key="paulu"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>During the revolutionary war, tobacco, in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_047" n="53"></pb>sold at a very extravagant
                            price, in consequence of<br/> which considerable quantities were shipped
                            within<br/> a year after the peace, so that the market was
                            over-<br/>stocked, and the price so reduced, that much money<br/> was
                            lost by the shippers; my brother and myself lost<br/> considerable. When
                            peace took place, there were<br/> scarce any European goods on hand,
                            which occasion-<br/>ed large importations to be made by our
                            merchants.<br/> The ill effects of this began to be severely felt in<br/>
<date when="1786">1786</date> to <date when="1788">1788</date>, which
                            ruined many in America and<br/><a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>.
                            Almost the whole of the American trade<br/> was then confined to
                                <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, and very little
                            com-<br/>mercial intercourse with any other port in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>.<br/> My brother <a href="/people/ceddy1">Charles<persname key="ceddy1"></persname></a> had shipped considerably on
                            credit<br/> to <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/geddy1">George Eddy<persname key="geddy1"></persname></a>, and many others, who,<br/>
                            owing to the country being inundated with every sort<br/> of goods, were
                            unable to remit to <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>.
                            Thomas<br/> and George Eddy, had supplied imprudently an
                            indi-<br/>vidual residing at <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, with<br/> goods to a large amount. He died,
                            and left his affairs<br/> in a very unsettled state. On this account I
                            removed<br/> with my family to <a href="/places/frede1">Fredericksburg<placename key="frede1"></placename></a>, and kept a large<br/> retail store in
                            the name of Thomas and George Eddy,<br/> my brother <a href="/people/geddy1">George<persname key="geddy1"></persname></a> remaining in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. This<br/><a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a> business turned out badly, and my being<br/>
                            much exposed to extravagant and dissipated company<br/> was a great
                            injury to me in every respect. In <date when="1788">1788</date>,<br/> I
                            returned to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and as my
                            brother in <a href="/places/lond">Lon-don<placename key="lond"></placename></a> had failed, it
                            became necessary for Thomas and<br/> George Eddy to make a settlement
                            with their cre-<br/>ditors.</p>
<p>We were discharged under a general act of bank-<br/>ruptcy for the State
                            of <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>. Since then,<br/> the
                            debts due from them have been mostly paid.<br/> Some were not legal
                            demands, and it was thought<br/> not right to pay them.</p>
<p>I now had an opportunity of learning in the school<br/> of adversity some
                            useful lessons, that have been of<br/> advantage to me. 1 have often
                            looked back to this <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_048" n="54"></pb>period, and recollected how much 1
                            lamented my mis-<br/>fortune, as it is generally termed, but which,
                            indeed,<br/> was a <quote>blessing in disguise,</quote> for, not
                            succeeding in<br/> business in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, obliged me to remove, whereas,<br/> had I
                            succeeded, I probably should have remained<br/> there, and, considering
                            my weakness, how apt to<br/> unite in company in every respect improper
                            and hurt-<br/>ful to my best interests, moral and religious, there
                            is<br/> every reason to suppose that I should have partaken<br/> of all
                            the evils produced in such a profligate and<br/> irreligious state of
                            society, as did then exist in <a href="/places/virgi">Virgi-nia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>. I seldom reflect on the circumstances
                            which<br/> forced me to leave that place, without feeling my<br/> mind
                            warmed with a sense of gratitude to the All-<br/> Wise Disposer of human
                            events, that he was gracious-<br/>ly pleased so to extend his
                            providential care over me,<br/> as to cause my removal from a state of
                            society that<br/> might, by my remaining in it, have proved
                            destruc-<br/>tive to my family, and ruinous to myself.</p>
<p>I omitted to mention, that on the <date when="1785-06-05">4th of 6th
                                month,<br/>1785</date>, I embarked for <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> in the English ship<br/> Mildred, bound for
                                <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>. I remained in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a><br/> only about three months, and
                            returned the latter part<br/> of <date when="1785-11">11th month</date>,
                            being absent near six months. This<br/> voyage was not productive of
                            much advantage to me.</p>
<p>In the year <date when="1790">1790</date>,1 went with my family to
                                <a href="/places/blacp">Black Point<placename key="blacp"></placename></a>, and in the
                            following year removed to <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. On my return to this city, all 1 had was
                            fifty<br/> pounds, supplied me by my father-in-law, but owing<br/> to
                            the kind attention of <a href="/people/rbown1">Robert Bowne<persname key="rbown1"></persname></a>,
                            and others, I<br/> soon got into some little business. At this
                            period,<br/> and for some years afterwards, there were no
                            Insu-<br/>rance offices in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,
                            and being encouraged by<br/> my friends, I commenced the business of an
                            Insurance<br/> broker. I pursued this with success for three or
                            four<br/> years. About <date when="1792">1792</date>, the public debt of
                            the United<br/> States was founded; this afforded an opportunity
                            for<br/>people to speculate in the public funds. In this busi-<br/>ness
                            I made a good deal of money. I declined acting <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_049" n="55"></pb>as an
                            Insurance broker, and did considerable business<br/> as an underwriter,
                            in which 1 was successful.</p>
<p>In <date when="1793">1793</date>, or <date when="1794">1794</date>, I was
                            elected a Director in the<br/> Mutual Insurance Company, and soon after
                            a Director<br/> in the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company, and<br/>
                            in <date when="1797">1797</date>, was appointed Treasurer of that
                            Company.<br/> From early life, all improvement of a public nature,<br/>
                            that tended to benefit the country, or in any shape<br/> promote the
                            happiness and welfare of mankind, were<br/> considered by me as highly
                            important, and claimed<br/> my attention. I have been connected with a
                            num-<br/>ber of public institutions, and have providentially<br/> been
                            the means of their being established.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, at this time, being in easy
                    circumstances,<br/> had leisure to turn his attention to some of those<br/>
                    charities that are of permanent benefit to mankind.<br/> He had read the human
                    mind with great sagacity<br/> and attention, and had analyzed the spirit of
                    society<br/> in his own country. He found, as every wise man<br/> will, that if
                    there are inevitable evils in the world,<br/> yet much may be done by way of
                    softening them,<br/> or preparing the mind to bear them.</p>
<p>One of the first objects of his exertions was that<br/> of establishing a
                    penitentiary in the State of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>,
                    for he believed that many who had been al-<br/>lured to the paths of vice might
                    be recalled, if proper<br/> methods were taken to instruct them in trades, to
                    give<br/> them industrious habits, and to keep them from the <br/>pollution of
                    those hardened in iniquity. He was<br/> well acquainted with the general plan
                    and economy<br/> of the penitentiary establishment in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, <br/>which had been got up by the influence of
                    the Soci-<br/>ety of Friends, but he thought even this system was<br/>
                    susceptible of improvement. No other state had then<br/> followed the example of
                        <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, nor had its<br/> fame
                    reached the leading philanthropists of <a href="/places/nycit">New
                        York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. The penal code in most of the States still has<br/> the
                    sanguinary spirit and hard features of the English<br/> penal code, which, with
                    all their boasted love of <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_050" n="56"></pb>liberty, was written in blood. The
                    tears of the sym-<br/>pathetic, and the voice of the benevolent, had made<br/>
                    but slow progress against the apathy of the great<br/> mass of mankind, and the
                    vindictive spirit of a few,<br/> who believe, or profess to believe, that the
                    world<br/> should be governed by a rod of iron. The hearts of<br/> the people
                    were made callous by the sight of stocks,<br/> whipping-posts, pillories, in
                    every shire, town, or con-<br/>siderable village. Flagellation with the
                    cat-o'-nine-<br/> tails, burning in the hand, or forehead, with a hot<br/> iron,
                    cropping the ears of prisoners in the pillory,<br/> were all common sights to
                    the youngest, as well as<br/> the oldest, portion of the community. The
                    Friends<br/> in <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> were among the
                    first people in the<br/> Union to make an effort to change this barbarity
                    for<br/> some milder system, thinking, and thinking justly,<br/> that severe
                    punishments produced, rather than dimi-<br/>nished crime. To this order of
                    Christians the public<br/> are indebted for many good examples; but if this<br/>
                    was the only thing they had done for mankind, they<br/> would deservedly stand
                    high with the historian. By<br/> their efforts, the penal code of <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> was<br/> ameliorated, and this good
                    precedent has been fol-<br/>lowed by most of the States in the Union.</p>
<p>In <date when="1796">1796</date>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was
                    on a journey to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,<br/> in company
                    with <a href="/people/pschu1">General Philip Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>, of the
                    State<br/> of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. <a href="/people/pschu1">Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a> was then a member of the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a> of that State, and was, justly, very
                    influential.<br/> He had been for more than forty years a prominent<br/>
                    character in the country, first, as an officer in the war<br/> of <date when="1755">1755</date>, and then a magnanimous leader in the
                    revo-<br/>lutionary contest. He had talents, integrity, property,<br/> and moral
                    courage, and was the very man for the<br/> purpose <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had in view, which was to engage him<br/> in the change he
                    wished to bring about in the penal<br/> code of the State of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and for the establish-<br/>ment of a
                    penitentiary system. <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> conversed
                    free-<br/>ly with <a href="/people/pschu1">Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a> upon every topic
                    that had a bearing<br/> upon the subject, and as soon as they reached the city
                    <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_051" n="57"></pb>of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, they
                    repaired to the prison and made<br/> a thorough examination of the edifice, the
                    convicts,<br/> the by-laws, the whole economy of the establishment,<br/> which
                    were satisfactory to that practical statesman<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had laboured to engage in the cause,
                    and he<br/> was now ready to go heart and hand with him. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> procured a large number of copies of the
                    penal<br/> code of <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, and
                    distributed them freely.<br/> To each of the members of the Legislature he
                    pre-<br/>sented a copy, at the next meeting of that body, after<br/> his visit
                    to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. The <a href="/people/pschu1">General<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>, with the as-<br/>sistance of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, drew up a bill for establishing<br/> a penitentiary system
                    in the State of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>.<br/> This bill he
                    did not introduce into the Senate him-<br/>self, but engaged the services of a
                    distinguished<br/> member of that body, <a href="/people/aspen1">Ambrose
                        Spencer<persname key="aspen1"></persname></a>,* <note rend="asterisk">* See Appendix.</note> a
                    gentleman<br/> of first rate abilities, and who has since filled the<br/>
                    important office of Chief Justice of the State of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                        York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, with high honour. Both <a href="/people/aspen1">Spencer<persname key="aspen1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/pschu1">Schuy-ler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>
                    made excellent speeches on the subject, which had<br/> a surprising effect upon
                    the members of the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>,<br/> and on the
                    audience. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was at hand to give<br/>
                    all the details that were necessary for a proper<br/> understanding of the
                    provisions of the bill. The<br/> moment the representatives of the people were
                    con-<br/>vinced of the utility and practicability of the mea-<br/>sure, the bill
                    was passed without any great difficulty.<br/> The bill directed a state prison
                    to be erected, and<br/> appointed <a href="/people/mclar1">Matthew
                        Clarkson<persname key="mclar1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jwatt1">John Watts<persname key="jwatt1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/istou1">Isaac
                        Stoutenburg<persname key="istou1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/jmurr1">John Murray,
                        jun.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>,<br/> commissioners to carry the bill into effect.
                    These<br/> commissioners designated <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> as a com-<br/>mittee for building the prison, who engaged
                    the<br/> architect and workmen, and went on in his own way<br/> with the whole
                    concern. This duty he set about to<br/> perform, but imitated very closely the
                    plan of the<br/> establishment at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>; the plan of the single<br/> rooms was an after
                    thought with <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, but <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_052" n="58"></pb>which, in fact, is the great improvement of the age.<br/> Such was <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s anxiety to have the penitenti-<br/>ary
                    succeed, that he not only consented to serve as a<br/> director, but as an
                    agent. He undertook the latter<br/> office, as his reputation was involved in
                    the success<br/> of the plan, and probably from an honest conviction<br/> that
                    he had made himself better acquainted with<br/> the whole subject than any other
                    person in the State.<br/> In these two offices, as inspector and agent, he
                    acted<br/> for more than four years. He was so assiduous and <br/>calculating in
                    his duties, that every anticipation of<br/> his friends and of himself was more
                    than realized.<br/> The expenses of the establishment had been less<br/> than
                    were expected, the health of the prisoners bet-<br/>ter than that of the free
                    and honest citizens in the<br/> ordinary walks of life. Such cleanliness, order,
                    and<br/> moral discipline, marked the penitentiary system<br/> under the
                    administration of this untired philanthro-<br/>pist, that those formerly
                    dissipated and sickly were<br/> made sober and healthy. He watched the results
                    of<br/> his plans, and held to a theory no longer than he<br/> found it good in
                    practice. His, was truly the induc-<br/>tive system of philanthropy. In <date when="1801">1801</date>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                    pub-<br/>lished an account of the State Prison of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                        York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>.<br/> His mottos were taken from Beccaria and
                    Montes-<br/>quieu; in fact, his whole theory of crimes and pun-<br/>ishments is
                    drawn from those great friends of liberty,<br/> Beccaria, Montesquieu, <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wpenn1">Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a>, and
                    other<br/> celebrated reformers of this and a former age. He<br/> pointed out
                    the state of the penal code in <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a><br/>
                    before <date when="1796">1796</date>, and showed, that after it was
                    altered,<br/> diminishing the number of capital punishments,<br/> and
                    substituting imprisonment, the humane change<br/> was made without increasing
                    crime. In this work,<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> recounted the history of the
                    establish-<br/>ment, described the edifice with its workshops, cells,<br/>
                    &amp;c.; and no one can deny but that the plan was<br/> admirable, according to
                    the state of information on<br/> these subjects at that time. The government of
                    the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_053" n="59"></pb>prison is also treated of, its officers named, and
                    their<br/> duties minutely pointed out. This, at present, would<br/> seem
                    superfluous, but, at that time, it was a new<br/> affair. The writer goes on to
                    give a full account<br/> of the prisoners in the State, with the treatment,<br/>
                    occupations, dress, and diet of the convicts, as also<br/> the means used, and
                    to be used, for their reforma-<br/>tion. On the subject of food and dress, he is
                    quite<br/> minute; all of which goes to prove that cleanliness<br/> is the great
                    promoter and preserver of health, and<br/> that no effective labour can be
                    expected of men who<br/> are not substantially and well fed. In fact, he
                    ap-<br/>proves of the maxim of the stable, that <q><emph rend="italic">to
                            get la<br/>bour from the animal, he should be kept under the full<br/>
                            force of feed—good wholesome feed, however coarse.</emph></q><br/>
                    Among these excellent statistics of the prison, there<br/> is nothing to be
                    compared to his doctrines upon the<br/> subject of reformation.</p>
<floatingtext type="narrative">
<p>The end of human punishments is the prevention<br/> of crimes. In the
                            endeavour to attain this end, three<br/> things are to be considered:
                            the amendment of the<br/> offender; the deterring of others by his
                            example;<br/> reparation to society and the party injured. Of these<br/>
                            objects, the first, without doubt, is of the highest<br/> importance.
                            Society cannot be better secured against<br/> crimes, than by
                            eradicating the evil passions and cor-<br/>rupt habits which are the
                            sources of guilt. The <br/>operation of punishment as a terror to
                            others, is gene-<br/>rally considered as momentary and uncertain in
                            its<br/> effects; for men are often found so regardless of the<br/>
                            future, as to perpetrate crimes at the instant they are<br/> witnessing
                            the most dreadful execution of a criminal<br/> for a similar offence.
                            The punishment of death pre-<br/>cludes the possibility of the amendment
                            of the crimi-<br/>nal by any human means. Every hope of
                            reforma-<br/>tion is at once cut off without a single effort to<br/>
                            accomplish so just and benevolent a purpose. Society<br/> and the
                            injured party are, indeed, in the strictest<br/> sense, avenged on the
                            head of the guilty offender. <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_054" n="60"></pb>Justice, however, not
                            revenge, is the true foundation<br/> of the right of punishment. But, it
                            is not the design<br/>of the present work to discuss the principles of a
                            <br/>code of criminal law, or to point out the errors which<br/> have
                            been perpetuated by the passions or ignorance<br/>of legislators.</p>
<p>If society is effectually secured against future mis-<br/>chief by the
                            imprisonment of the offender, it is that<br/> mode of punishment also
                            which affords the only<br/> chance of reclaiming him from evil. It is by
                            con-<br/>finement to hard labour in a penitentiary house, that<br/> the
                            primary and legitimate purpose of human punish-<br/>ment is to be
                            effected. The character of men are<br/> endlessly diversified, and their
                            motives and actions<br/> assume a thousand different hues. In
                            considering<br/> convicts, we may, in general, distinguish them
                            into<br/> three classes: men grown old in habits of profligacy<br/> and
                            violence, unfeeling and desperate offenders, who<br/> discover no signs
                            of contrition, and yield little hope<br/> of amendment: those who, in
                            early life, have received<br/> a moral and religious education, and,
                            though after-<br/>wards led by passion and evil example into the
                            com-<br/>mission of crimes, still retain some sense of virtue:<br/>
                            those who, have sustained a fair reputation, are<br/> arrested for the
                            first public offence, before they have<br/> become familiar with vice;
                            who wished, perhaps, to<br/> return to the path of virtue, but had not
                            energy enough<br/> to retrace their steps.</p>
<p>In forming an opinion of the depravity of convicts,<br/> nothing can be
                            more unjust than to confound these<br/> different classes in the same
                            judgment. All were once<br/> innocent; but, blinded by passion, allured
                            by present<br/> temptation, they have mistaken their true interest,<br/>
                            and been gradually led into the depths of vice and<br/> criminality. In
                            designating punishments for various<br/> offences, the legislator can
                            regard only the tendency<br/> of actions to injure society, and
                            distribute those pun-<br/>ishments according to the comparative degrees
                            of harm<br/> such actions may produce. He cannot foresee those <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_055" n="61"></pb>circumstances in the moral condition of the agent<br/> which
                            may justly lessen or aggravate his guilt; and,<br/> by the wise
                            constitution and jealous policy of our<br/> laws, judges are not vested
                            with any discretionary<br/> power to apportion the punishment according
                            to a<br/> greater or less criminality of intention in the
                            offen-<br/>der. It is in a penitentiary house, that an oppor-<br/>tunity
                            is afforded of distinguishing the shades of guilt<br/> in different
                            offenders, and of correcting that error<br/> and injustice, in some
                            degree inseparable from the<br/> best system of laws, by which persons,
                            whose guilt<br/> admits of different degrees, are subjected to the
                            same<br/> punishment.* <note rend="asterisk">* This topic may be
                                enlarged upon in the conclusion, when we come to<br/> speak of <emph rend="italic">pardons</emph>. It would greatly assist the
                                Inspectors in the just exer-<br/>cise of their power, if the judges
                                who sentence convicts were required to<br/> furnish a statement of
                                all the circumstances that attended the trial, or<br/> which may
                                have come to their knowledge, and which may serve to render<br/> the
                                guilt of the convict, in their opinion, more or less aggravated.
                            </note> It is for those to whom the superinten-<br/>dence of such an
                            institution is intrusted, to effect, as<br/> far as possible, the
                            amendment of the delinquent, and<br/> thus to fulfil the highest duty of
                            humanity. And,<br/> it is with no small pleasure that the inspectors
                            have<br/> observed, that a number of those who have been
                            dis-<br/>charged from the prison confided to their care, have<br/>
                            continued in habits of industry and sobriety, and<br/> bid fair to
                            become good members of society. It<br/> would, no doubt, be interesting
                            to the philanthropist,<br/> to be informed of the particular incidents
                            in the<br/> lives of such men, and the circumstances which<br/> have
                            furnished ground to predict the rectitude of<br/> their future conduct.
                            But this would, in some<br/> degree, lead the writer beyond his
                            immediate ob-<br/>ject; and motives of prudence and charity ought,<br/>
                            perhaps, to induce him, for the present, to forbear such<br/> a
                            recital.</p>
<p>The most efficacious means of reformation are to<br/> be found in that
                            system of regular labour and exact<br/> temperance by which habits of
                            industry and sobriety<br/> are formed. The inspectors have not been
                            unmind-<br/>ful of other means of amendment, less immediately <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_056" n="62"></pb>connected with the nature of the punishment to which<br/>
                            the convicts are sentenced. By the great attention<br/> paid to <emph rend="italic">cleanliness</emph> in every part of the prison,
                            they<br/> have shown their opinion of its importance in aiding<br/>
                            reformation. Its benign influence on the physical<br/> character, though
                            well understood by many, is not<br/> duly estimated by the bulk of
                            mankind. Though<br/> its effect on bodily health be more obvious, its
                            less<br/> striking but equally certain effect on the mind has<br/> been
                            no where more fully experienced than in this<br/> prison. It is found to
                            soften the temper, meliorate <br/>the disposition, and to produce a
                            regard to temper-<br/>ance, order, and industry; and, by exciting
                            more<br/> agreeable and tranquil sensations, to render men
                            sus-<br/>ceptible of good impressions, and thereby conduce to<br/> their
                            future amendment.* <br/><note rend="asterisk" resp="editor">* <a href="/people/crumf1">Count RUMFORD<persname key="crumf1"></persname></a>, in his Essays, speaking of the good
                                effects produced<br/> on the mendicants in the House of Industry at
                                Munich, by cleanliness,<br/> says, that <said who="crumf1">virtue
                                    never dwelt long with filth and nastiness; nor do I<br/> believe

                                        attentive to cleanliness</emph>, who<br/> was a consummate
                                    villain.</said></note></p>
<p>In the winter, those of the convicts who have<br/> appeared to be most
                            meritorious, are allowed, with<br/> the approbation of the keeper, to be
                            taught reading,<br/> writing, and arithmetic. Teachers are selected
                            from<br/> such of them as are competent, and twenty are per-<br/>mitted
                            to meet together daily with one of the keep-<br/>ers, and to receive
                            instruction for about two hours in<br/> the evening. This is considered
                            as a privilege, and<br/> conferred on those only, who, by a peaceable,
                            indus-<br/>trious, and regular course of conduct, have shown a<br/>
                            disposition towards reformation. It is a further requi-<br/>site for an
                            admission into this school, that the person<br/>should have performed
                            labour above his task to the<br/> value of four shillings a week, which
                            is to pay for<br/> the implements of writing, light, and fuel.</p>
<p> Care is taken, as far as possible, to separate the<br/> less vicious
                            from the more hardened and daring offen-<br/>ders. About twenty-two of
                            the most obdurate crimi-<br/>nals are kept confined and at work in
                            separate <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_057" n="63"></pb>apartments, and are not suffered to come out,
                            or to<br/> have communication with other prisoners, but are<br/>
                            constantly watched by keepers day and night. Expe-<br/>rience will
                            evince, that among any given number of<br/> convicts, one tenth part may
                            be fairly considered as<br/> desperate and hardened villains, who appear
                            incor-<br/>rigible; and, it is of importance that such should be<br/>
                            carefully selected and separated from the rest, as it<br/> is more
                            probable they may, by proper management,<br/> be reformed.</p>
<p>As another means of reformation, attention is paid<br/> to their
                            religious and moral instruction.</p>
<p>A large room in the prison, very neatly finished, is<br/> set apart for
                            the purpose of divine worship. This<br/> room, and the gallery round it,
                            will accommodate<br/> about six hundred persons.</p>
<p>In this place the prisoners are assembled on the<br/> first day of each
                            week, when one of their number<br/> reads a sermon and prayers, and the
                            rest join in sing-<br/>ing psalms.</p>
<p>It is expected that the public preachers of the gos-<br/>pel in the city
                            will cheerfully devote a small portion<br/> of their time to the service
                            of these unhappy beings,<br/> who have so much need of their
                            instruction, and of<br/> the counsel of the truly good and
                            benevolent.</p>
<p>As no distinction of sect exists in this great work<br/> of charity and
                            benevolence, it is hoped that religious<br/> characters of every
                            Christian denomination will feel<br/> it their duty to visit them on the
                            day set apart for<br/> divine worship; since it is obvious that a due
                            atten-<br/>tion to this important duty must produce the most<br/>
                            salutary effects on the minds and conduct of the pri-<br/>soners, and
                            most powerfully promote the great plan<br/> of reformation.* <br/><note rend="asterisk">* <said who="jhowa1">As rational and immortal
                                    beings, we owe this to them, nor can any<br/> criminality of

<a href="/people/jhowa1">HOWARD<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>. </note></p>
<p>Connected with this scheme of punishment and<br/> reformation, is another
                            object, which, though of infe-<br/>rior importance in a moral view, is
                            yet deserving of <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_058" n="64"></pb> attention. This is, indemnity to the
                            community for<br/> the expense of the conviction and maintenance of
                            <br/>the offender. It is highly probable, that with due<br/> management
                            and economy, the profit of the labour of<br/> the convicts may be
                            rendered equal to their support.<br/> Such a result, however, has not
                            been anticipated by<br/> the zealous friends of reform in penal law in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.<br/> They have regarded it
                            as the indispensable duty of<br/> legislators, to meliorate the laws,
                            and correct the<br/> abuses of prisons, without counting the cost of
                            their<br/> justice or humanity. In <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, we are assu-<br/>red, that the experiment
                            has been attended with<br/> success;—and when the improved system of
                            the<br/> penitentiary house of this state has had time to operate<br/>
                            fully, there can be no doubt of a result equally <br/> favourable. It
                            ought to have fair scope, and not to<br/> be thwarted in its infancy, by
                            distrust, or the selfish<br/> views of individuals or particular classes
                            of men. A<br/> wise legislature will extend its concern to the
                            whole<br/> community, and, regardless of private interests,
                            stea-<br/>dily pursue a plan the best calculated to promote the<br/>
                            general good.</p>
<p>In the first establishment of the prison, the inspec<br/>tors have had to
                            encounter all the difficulties of a<br/> new experiment, with the
                            disadvantage of imperfect <br/>knowledge in many branches of
                            manufacture. A<br/> system was to be formed, by which above two
                            hun-<br/>dred convicts, many of them hardened, desperate,<br/> and
                            refractory, and many ignorant, or incapacitated<br/> through infirmity
                            or disease, might be brought into a<br/> regular course of productive
                            labour. To find suitable<br/> employment for so many persons, was a
                            matter of<br/> considerable difficulty. In the choice of
                            occupations,<br/> regard must be had to those which require the
                            least<br/> capital, are most productive of profit, and most
                            con-<br/>sistent with the health of the convicts, and the general<br/>
                            security of the prison. Among the different kinds<br/> of manufactures,
                            that of shoes was first introduced,<br/> and has been fouud the most
                            convenient and profita-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_059" n="65"></pb>ble. The capital required for
                            the purchase of the raw<br/> materials is not large, and the
                            manufactured article<br/> will always meet with a ready sale; since the

                            continually increasing, beyond the power of the<br/> tradesmen of the

                            manufacture<br/> of nails, and other articles, has been carried on
                            for<br/> about two years. This required more capital; and<br/> it was
                            not until very lately that sufficient experience<br/> was gained, in the
                            purchase of stock and the use of<br/> machinery, to enable the
                            inspectors to manage this<br/> branch of business with advantage. These
                            circum-<br/>stances, and many others that might be detailed,<br/> which
                            necessarily attend an infant establishment, and<br/> which diminished
                            the profits of the past years, will,<br/> in future, cease to produce
                            expense and embarrass-<br/>ment. It is doubtful, whether the manufacture
                            of<br/> nails, and of several other articles, ought to be carried<br/>
                            on to a great extent, as they require too large a capi-<br/>tal in
                            advance. Experience will furnish, every year,<br/> grounds for
                            improvement in the mode of conducting<br/> the branches of industry, or
                            in the introduction of<br/> more advantageous kinds of labour; and there
                            is<br/> every reason to believe, that, with a competent capi-<br/>tal,
                            the business may be rendered so productive as <br/>to defray the
                            expenses of conviction and maintenance<br/> of the prisoners.
                            Calculations, however, founded on<br/> the statements of the past year,
                            will not furnish ade-<br/>quate means of judging with certainty of the
                            future<br/> profits which may be made to arise from the labour<br/> of
                            the convicts.</p>
<p>That the number of convicts has increased since<br/> the erection of the
                            State Prison, is evident. But to<br/> infer from that fact, that the new
                            and milder scheme<br/> of punishment has been less efficacious in
                            preventing<br/> crimes than the old and sanguinary system, would be<br/>
                            a most partial and erroneous conclusion. The <emph rend="italic">true</emph>
<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_060" n="66"></pb>causes of this increase of crimes are the rapid
                            growth<br/> of our population and wealth; the consequent luxury<br/> and
                            corruption of, manners, particularly in the capital<br/> of the state;
                            and the great number of indigent and<br/> vicious emigrants from
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> and the <a href="/places/westi">West Indies<placename key="westi"></placename></a>,<br/> driven hither by the
                            disordered and distressful condi-<br/>tion of their native countries, or
                            to escape the ven-<br/>geance of the laws.</p>
<p>More than <emph rend="italic">three fourths</emph> of the whole number
                            of<br/> crimes are committed in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. Its<br/> population has almost doubled in ten
                            years, and the<br/> increase of its trade and wealth is unequalled in
                            the<br/> history of commercial states. It is certain also, that
                            under<br/> the present system of punishment, a much less<br/> number of
                            offenders escape conviction. Individuals<br/> do not, from a sense of
                            the terrible consequences to<br/> the party, refuse to prosecute; nor
                            juries, from motives<br/> of compassion, forbear to convict the guilty.
                            This<br/> is a most salutary consequence of the melioration of<br/> our
                            penal laws.</p>
<p>The corruption of morals engenders those crimes<br/> which pollute
                            society, and undermine the security of<br/> life and property. It is the
                            duty of government to<br/> begin at the source, and to endeavour, by
                            every<br/> rational and practicable expedient, to prevent crimes,<br/>
                            rather than to apply the painful and uncertain remedy<br/> of punishment
                            to evils grown formidable by negli-<br/>gence. It is in vain, under the
                            best devised plan of<br/> punishment, to expect that crimes should be
                            dimin-<br/>ished or exterminated, if laws are not framed to check<br/>
                            the progress of vice, and to arrest the first steps of<br/> guilt.</p>
<p>It is well known, that the greater number of crimes<br/> originate in the
                            irregular and vicious habits produced<br/> by intoxication, and by the
                            idle, low, and dissipated<br/> practices encouraged in taverns and
                            tippling-houses.<br/> There are few criminals whose gradual
                            depravation<br/> cannot be traced to this source. It is well
                            ascertained,<br/> that in this city there are more than twelve hundred
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_061" n="67"></pb>taverns or shops, where spirituous liquors are
                            retailed<br/> in drams or in the form of grog. In eight or ten
                            con-<br/>siderable streets, one fourth part of the whole num-<br/>ber of
                            houses are <emph rend="italic">taverns and groceries</emph>, or, in
                            other<br/> words, <emph rend="italic">dram-shops</emph>. The number of
                            taverns is unlimit<br/>ited by law. By the city charter, the power of
                            granting<br/> licenses is vested in the mayor, who is the sole
                            judge<br/> of the propriety of granting them, or of their number.<br/>
                            Thirty shillings are paid for each license, four fifths<br/> of which
                            sum goes into the city treasury, and the<br/> residue to the mayor.
                            While a revenue is derived to<br/> the corporation from these licenses,
                            it is not to be<br/> expected that there will be much solicitude to
                            lessen<br/> their number, or to examine minutely into the merits<br/> of
                            the applicants for them. Some regulations ought<br/> to be adopted for
                            the reformation of the police in this<br/> respect. Grocers ought to be
                            strictly prohibited from<br/> retailing liquors in drams. The number of
                            taverns<br/> ought to be greatly diminished. Licenses should not<br/> be
                            granted but to persons who are recommended by<br/> five known and
                            respectable citizens, and under much<br/> larger penalties than at
                            present, to enforce their obser-<br/>vance of the laws.* <note rend="asterisk" resp="editor">* In the town of <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a> there are <emph rend="italic">fifty</emph>
                                taverns, or persons, licensed to<br/> retail liquors in small
                                quantities. Three or four times that number, one<br/> would imagine,
                                would be more than sufficient for this city. </note> At present, the
                            temptation to<br/> the indigent and labouring classes of the people
                            to<br/> indulge in drink is so powerful, and the gratification<br/> so
                            easy, at every turn of the street, that the greater<br/> number spend a
                            large portion of their time and earn-<br/>ings in repeated indulgences
                            of this depraved appe-<br/>tite, during the day, and return to their
                            families in a<br/> state of partial or complete intoxication. The
                            per-<br/>nicious consequences of such habits, to the individual<br/> and
                            to society, are too striking to need any elaborate<br/> description, to
                            enforce the propriety of adopting every<br/> suitable means of
                            legislative and municipal regula-<br/>tion, for their prevention.</p>
<p>A further source of vice and criminality is to be<br/> found in the <emph rend="italic">horse-races</emph> which regularly take place<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_062" n="68"></pb>in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> and some of
                            the neighbouring coun-<br/>ties. These draw together crowds of people,
                            who<br/> engage in wagering, all kinds of games of chance,<br/> and in
                            debauchery, which produce habits that lead<br/> to the ruin of many, and
                            drive numbers to the com-<br/>mission of crimes. Horse-races,
                            billiard-tables, and<br/> all games of chance, ought to be strictly
                            prohibit-<br/>ed. <emph rend="italic">Baiting</emph> of animals with
                            dogs, and every spe-<br/>cies of amusement which may tend to harden
                            the<br/> heart, and render the manners of the people ferocious,<br/>
                            ought to be prevented by a well regulated police.<br/> Laws are made for
                            the preservation of decency and<br/> order on the first day of the week
                            ; and it remains<br/> only to have them more faithfully executed.
                            Perhaps<br/> there is no city of equal extent, where fewer crimes<br/>
                            escape detection and punishment, or where greater<br/> order and
                            tranquillity prevail. Too much praise can-<br/>not be bestowed on those
                            to whom the peace and<br/> safety of our city is entrusted, for their
                            unwearied<br/>attention and vigilance in the discharge of duties,
                            the<br/> extent and importance of which are not generally<br/>
                            understood, or fully estimated. But, notwithstanding<br/> the improved
                            state of our police, and the care of our<br/> magistrates, every year
                            furnishes new objects of atten-<br/>tion, evils which demand additional
                            remedies, and<br/> more powerful reasons for devising and applying<br/>
                            them in the best and most effectual manner.</p>
<p>Another object more immediately connected with<br/> the subject of this
                            work, is the present mode of pun-<br/>ishment for petty crimes. The only
                            prison in this<br/> city for the punishment of those convicted of
                            small<br/> thefts and other petty offences, is the <emph rend="italic">Bridewell</emph>, part<br/> of which is also appropriated to the
                            safe keeping of<br/> prisoners before their trial or conviction. At
                            present,<br/> vagrants, disorderly persons, and convicts for petty<br/>
                            offences, are confined in this prison ; and are put into<br/> rooms
                            together, without any discrimination, or regard<br/> to difference of
                            character. No proper or adequate<br/> means are used to prevent
                            profanity, intoxication,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_063" n="69"></pb>filth, or idleness. In this
                            condition, corrupting and<br/> corrupted, their imprisonment, so far
                            from tending to<br/> produce the amendment of the culprits, or to
                            secure<br/> society against the effects of their future misconduct,<br/>
                            serves, by the contagion of example and the exaspe-<br/>ration of bad
                            passions, to render them an hundred<br/> fold more vicious and
                            untractable. It is, in truth, a<br/>
<emph rend="italic">nursery</emph> of criminals for the state prison. As
                            a remedy<br/> for this defect in the penal system, it is suggested,<br/>
                            that a building should be erected by the corporation,<br/> large enough
                            to contain sixty cells, of the same dimen-<br/>sions as those in the
                            state prison-that the <emph rend="italic">police<br/> magistrates</emph>
                            should have power to try, in a summary<br/> way, and to sentence to
                            solitary confinement in these<br/> cells, vagrants, drunkards, riotous
                            and disorderly per-<br/>sons, &amp;c. for a time not exceeding thirty
                            days;—that<br/> the quarter sessions of the city should send
                            persons<br/> convicted of assaults and batteries, petit larcenies,<br/>
                            and such offences as are not aggravated or atrocious,<br/> for a time
                            not exceeding sixty or ninety days. The<br/> convicts should be kept in
                            these cells in perfect soli-<br/>tude, and on spare diet, in the manner
                            practised in<br/> the state prison. Such a punishment, for sixty
                            days,<br/> would be more severe and terrible, and tend more to<br/> the
                            prevention of crimes, than confinement, for one<br/> or two years, to
                            hard labour in the state prison. It<br/> would also tend more to the
                            reformation of the offen-<br/>der himself. Detached from vicious
                            companions, from<br/> temptation, and from all means of gratifying
                            his<br/> depraved appetites, conscience would have time to<br/> awaken a
                            sense of guilt and remorse for his past<br/> folly and misconduct.</p>
<p>Should a plan of such obvious utility be adopted<br/> and carried into
                            execution, it would not then be neces-<br/>sary to send convicts to the
                            state prison for a shorter<br/> period than three years. For every
                            person once con-<br/>fined in the solitary cells, who should, after his
                            release,<br/> commit a second offence, would deserve to be
                            sen-<br/>tenced to hard labour for at least three years. Indeed,
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_064" n="70"></pb>it might, with propriety, be left to the discretion
                            of<br/> the court, in certain cases of second offences, to inflict<br/>
                            the same punishment as in cases of grand larceny;<br/> since it can
                            hardly be supposed, that any material or<br/> lasting effect can be
                            produced on a criminal, by the<br/> labour and discipline of a
                            penitentiary house, in a<br/> shorter time than four or five years. And
                            if he is<br/> incorrigible by means of solitude, temperance, and<br/>
                            cleanliness, he will not merit, if he is guilty of a<br/> second
                            offence, a punishment less severe than impri-<br/>sonment for that
                            length of time.</p>
<p>It is not requisite, here, to enter into the details<br/> of this plan of
                            a county prison; which, if found, on<br/> experiment, to succeed in the
                            city of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, may<br/> be

<p>Before concluding this <emph rend="italic">account</emph>, it may be
                            proper to<br/> make a few remarks, the result of some observation
                            and<br/> experience, on a subject which may have an essen-<br/>tial
                            influence on the present scheme of punishments.</p>
<p>It has been observed by BECCARIA, whose opinions<br/> have the force of
                            axioms in the science of penal law,<br/> that <quote>as punishments
                                become more mild, clemency<br/> and PARDON become less
                                necessary;</quote> — that <quote>clemency<br/> belongs to the
                                legislator, and not to the executer of<br/> the laws: a virtue which
                                ought to shine in the code,<br/> not in private judgments. To show
                                mankind that<br/> crimes may be pardoned, or that punishment is
                                not<br/>the necessary consequence, is to nourish the flattering<br/>
                                hope of impunity.</quote>—<quote>Let then the executer of the<br/>
                                law be inexorable, but let the legislator be tender,<br/> indulgent,
                                and humane.*</quote>

<p>These principles, though just in theory, necessarily<br/> presuppose a
                            perfect system of penal law, by which<br/> each punishment is with such
                            exact justice appor-<br/>tioned to each crime, that no difference of
                            circum- <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_065" n="71"></pb>stances can arise in any case, which ought to
                            vary<br/> the punishment prescribed for the particular offence.<br/> No
                            code so perfect has yet been framed, and until<br/> such a one is
                            promulgated, it is necessary that the<br/> power of pardoning should
                            reside somewhere, to pre-<br/>vent that injustice in particular cases
                            which the legis-<br/>lator did not foresee, or could not avoid. By
                            our<br/> constitution, this power is confided to the governor,<br/> the
                            chief executive magistrate.* <br/><note rend="asterisk">* In cases of
                                treason and murder, the governor cannot pardon, but may<br/>
                                reprieve the convict until the next meeting of the legislature, who
                                may<br/> pardon if they think fit. </note></p>
<p>And under the present penal laws, except in those<br/> cases where the
                            punishment of death still remains,<br/> the power of pardoning may be
                            exercised without<br/> violating the principle advanced by the
                            philosopher<br/> of Milan. It may be asserted, that, in the
                            deliberate<br/> and impartial manner in which justice is
                            adminis-<br/>tered in our courts, it is scarcely possible that any<br/>
                            man can be <emph rend="italic">presented</emph>, by a grand jury, tried
                            and<br/> convicted by a petit jury of twelve men, in the<br/> presence
                            of the court and the world, without a degree<br/> of guilt deserving of
                            some punishment. Imprison-<br/>ment for a short period, under the mild
                            and humane<br/> regulations of the state prison, cannot, in cases
                            the<br/> most favourable to the prisoners, be deemed unjust.<br/> It may
                            be laid down, then, as a general principle,<br/> that no person,
                            convicted of a crime, and sentenced<br/> to imprisonment, ought to be
                            pardoned, until he has<br/> suffered a punishment proportioned to the
                            degree of<br/> his guilt, or at least so much as may satisfy the
                            com-<br/>munity he has injured. Under the guidance of this<br/>
                            principle, it is believed, that the power of pardoning<br/> may be made
                            conducive to a more perfect dispensa-<br/>tion of justice, and
                            subservient to the plan of refor-<br/>mation intended by a penitentiary
                            prison. It will<br/> not be thought useless to endeavour to fix some
                            general<br/> rules for the exercise of a power, which, if arbitrary<br/>
                            and capricious, may produce consequences neither<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_066" n="72"></pb>foreseen nor intended; but, if exerted with sound<br/> discretion, so
                            far from weakening the laws, will<br/> strengthen their operation.</p>

                                essential importance.<br/> Indeed, this precaution has been taken by
                                the late<br/> and present governor of the state, who have
                                applied<br/> for the requisite information to the inspectors,
                                the<br/> majority of whom have joined in a recommendation<br/> for
                                pardon, where they thought it clearly merited by<br/> the convict.
                                Previous to such recommendation, how-<br/>ever, the inspectors think
                                it their duty to inquire,— <br/>whether the prisoner was convicted
                                by clear and<br/> undoubted testimony ; which may be ascertained
                                by<br/> the report of the judge before whom he was tried;—<br/>
                                whether the circumstances attending the commission<br/> of the crime
                                denote a greater or less degree of depra-<br/>vity;—whether the
                                prisoner has already suffered a<br/> punishment sufficient to
                                satisfy society, and to afford<br/> a reasonable ground to believe
                                that his release will<br/> not diminish the dread of future
                                punishment in him,<br/> or inspire the hope of impunity in
                                others;—whether,<br/> while in prison, he has conducted himself with
                                uni-<br/>form decency, industry, and sobriety, and has never<br/>
                                attempted to violate any of its regulations;—and,<br/> lastly,
                                whether, from what is known of his temper,<br/> character, and
                                deportment, it is probable, that if resto-<br/>red to society, he
                                will become a peaceable, honest, and<br/> industrious citizen. These
                                inquiries ought to be<br/> satisfactorily answered in favour of the
                                convict,<br/> before he is recommended for pardon; for it is not
                                a<br/> common or ordinary course of good conduct and indus-<br/>try,
                                but a pre-eminent and unexceptionable behaviour,<br/> that should
                                entitle a prisoner to this grace. A convict<br/> radically and
                                incurably depraved, in hope of gaining<br/> favour, may, for a
                                season, so far disguise his genuine<br/> character, as to deceive
                                his keepers and inspectors.<br/> Sufficient time should be allowed
                                to discover his real<br/> disposition, which, on some occasion, at
                                an unguarded<br/> moment, will show itself. In short, pardon ought
                                <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_068" n="74"></pb>never to be granted from the momentary impulse

                                to the individual, but as regulated by no fixed<br/> principle, must
                                be injurious to the public; nor ought<br/> it be to granted, merely
                                at the instance of friends<br/> or relations, or from considerations
                                of family, but<br/> from the clear and unbiassed dictates of justice
                                and<br/> humanity, and in such a manner that the community<br/> may
                                be satisfied that the influence of the law is not<br/> impaired, nor
                                its severity relaxed, without sufficient<br/> reason.</item>

<p> No man who enters the prison with vicious habits,<br/> can be reasonably
                            expected to be divested of them in<br/> less than four or five years;
                            and it would greatly<br/> injure the penitentiary system, to pardon any
                            prisoner<br/> before the expiration of that time, unless in
                            extraor-<br/>dinary cases, which may possibly, but very rarely,<br/>
                            happen. When sentenced to imprisonment for life,<br/> no person ought to
                            be released, until after seven years<br/> confinement. If, under the
                            circumstances which have<br/> been mentioned, and on principles here
                            stated, par-<br/>dons are sometimes granted, instead of
                            counteracting<br/> the force of the law, they may be made to
                            harmonize<br/> with, and support the general scheme of punishments<br/>
                            so widely adopted. Its success must, in a great mea-<br/>sure, depend on
                            the wisdom of the regulations devised<br/> for the internal management
                            of the prison, and on the<br/> prudence, disinterested attention, and
                            perseverance<br/> of those to whom that management is entrusted.</p>
<p>To exhibit a simple and faithful account of those<br/> regulations, and
                            to furnish such useful hints as the<br/> writer from his own experience,
                            and the suggestions<br/> of others, could impart, is the purpose of the
                            preceding<br/> pages. He is sensible that the plan of interior

                            great burden of keeping convicts,<br/> and diminishing the chances of
                            escape, by bringing<br/> them all into one prison, under a more vigilant

                            presents the<br/> best opportunity, by the magnitude and liberality
                            of<br/> its plan, for the formation of a well-digested scheme<br/>of
                            internal management and economy, and the full<br/> execution of the only
                            just and beneficent system yet<br/> devised for the punishment and

</floatingtext>
<p>This extract concentrates much that has been said<br/> by seer or sage on this
                    subject since that date. He<br/> goes on to demonstrate what can be done by
                    care<br/> and sagacity in the great work of reform and econo-<br/>my, and shows
                    that the labours of the convicts almost<br/> supported themselves, and that the
                    State was only<br/> charged five thousand dollars, and the salaries of the<br/>
                    officers and keepers of the prison.</p>
<p> Dissensions soon arose, not among the superin-<br/>tendents of the prison, but
                    amongst the rulers of the<br/> state. The council of appointment changed
                    the<br/> whole board, and brought into office those who were<br/> wholly
                    ignorant of the least of their duties. The<br/> funds they were entrusted with
                    were badly spent,<br/> and all the land-marks of economy and system swept<br/>
                    away. There were two years of returning reason,<br/> in <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s opinion, when <a href="/people/wtorr1">Mr. William
                        Torry<persname key="wtorr1"></persname></a><br/> acted as agent. This good man attempted to bring<br/>
                    back the laws and customs of the establishment to <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_070" n="76"></pb>their
                    pristine course, but he, after two years service,<br/> ceased to act in the
                    cause.</p>
<p>Soon after the state prison was built in the city of<br/>
<a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> began to think that if he had<br/> not committed an error in
                    his plan, it certainly was<br/> susceptible of improvement. He found, from
                    careful<br/> observation, that several confined in a cell corrupted<br/> each
                    other, for each one told to his companions his<br/> career of vice, and all
                    joined by sympathetic villany<br/> to keep each other in countenance. This, to
                    the eye<br/> of the shrewd philanthropist was not long conceal-<br/>ed ; and
                    like a man of moral intrepidity, he avowed<br/> his error and condemned it.
                    There can be no doubt<br/> but this single-cell plan now in use, was
                    conceived<br/> and made known to the public by <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, before<br/> it was thought of either in this country, or in
                        <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>,<br/> by any other person. In <date when="1802-03">March, 1802</date>, he visited <a href="/places/alban">Al-bany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, solely for the purpose of prevailing upon
                    the<br/> Legislature to pass a bill for erecting a prison in the<br/> city and
                    county of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and by degrees to
                    ex-<br/>tend the plan to other districts in the state, which<br/>prison was to
                    contain solitary cells. These prisons <br/>were to be used for all those who had
                    committed<br/> minor crimes, and no one was to be sent to the state<br/> prison
                    for a less term than three years. Into the<br/> solitary cells in these, the
                    prisoner was to be confined<br/> according to his crime. So situated, he would
                    have<br/> time to reflect upon his past conduct, and to begin<br/> the work of
                    reformation. A bill was passed for this<br/> purpose, but by making it optional
                    with the city<br/> and county, instead of being imperative, the plan<br/> was
                    not carried into effect, notwithstanding every<br/> exertion of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> and his friends, in urging it<br/> upon the
                    corporation. One committee after another<br/> took it into consideration, and
                    seemed highly pleased<br/> with the plan, being convinced that it would be
                    a<br/> means of preventing crime, yet they did not comply<br/> with the
                    requisition. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was not to be
                    dis-<br/>couraged by the failure. He mentioned his plan in <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_071" n="77"></pb>a
                    letter to his friend <a href="/people/pcolq1">Patrick Colquhoun<persname key="pcolq1"></persname></a>, Esq.
                    of <a href="/places/lond">Lon-don<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, one of the great moral
                    reformers of the day, who<br/> highly approved of it, and handed <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s com-<br/>munication to <a href="/people/haddi1">Lord Sidmouth<persname key="haddi1"></persname></a>, then Minister for the<br/> Home
                    Department, who, as well as <a href="/people/pcolq1">Mr.
                    Colquhoun<persname key="pcolq1"></persname></a>,<br/> gave his decided approbation to the plan, and
                    wished<br/> it should be introduced into <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>; and this was <br/>done by the <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> Society for improving Prison<br/> Discipline, and one or
                    two prisons were soon after<br/> built upon this plan, one near <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, containing six<br/> or seven hundred cells. A
                    prison was also built at<br/>
<a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburgh<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, in <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, upon this construction,<br/> containing from five
                    to six hundred cells. When the<br/><a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>
                    state prison was erected, <a href="/places/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<placename key="teddy1"></placename></a>
                    urged<br/> them to have the buildings wholly divided into cells,<br/> seven by
                    nine feet each, but most of the commission-<br/>ers were afraid to try the
                    experiment fully, but did<br/> it only in part, and this change from the old
                    plan<br/> was made from their confidence in the judgment of<br/> the
                    adviser.</p>
<p>In <date when="1824">1824</date>, Messrs. <a href="/people/gtibb1">Tibbits<persname key="gtibb1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/salle1">Allen<persname key="salle1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/shopk1">Hopkins<persname key="shopk1"></persname></a>, were<br/> appointed by the legislature of
                        <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, to exa-<br/>mine and report on
                    certain questions relating to the<br/> state prisons; the result of their
                    labours was a confir-<br/>mation of the system that <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had recommend-<br/>ed twenty-two years before. These
                    commissioners,<br/> on entering on their inquiries, issued a circular,
                    which<br/> was answered by several gentlemen, and amongst<br/> them, by
                        <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>. Notwithstanding the fact,
                    that<br/> loose habits of doing business, and inattention to<br/> the proper
                    methods of reformation, united to the<br/> expense of the experiment, the public
                    had, in a good<br/> degree, become tired of the penitentiary system, and<br/> it
                    was thought by many, that it would be abandoned<br/> altogether; yet <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> adhered to his previous<br/> opinion, and
                    returned the following answer.</p>

                            questions relating to the State Prisons.<br/>
<salute>RESPECTED FRIENDS,—</salute></opener>
<p>I received your circular letter, containing a number<br/> of queries, to
                            which you request distinct replies.</p>
<p>First—<q>Is the present system established in the<br/>
<a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> prison, a real system of
                                punishment? Are <br/>the convicts, in general, less comfortable than
                                they<br/> would be if at liberty?</q></p>
<p>Answer—I beg leave to state that, in my opinion,<br/> the system
                            established in the <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> State
                            Prison<br/> is not a real system of punishment calculated to
                            pre-<br/>vent crimes.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly convicts are, in general, less comforta-<br/>ble than they
                            would be if at liberty.</p>
<p>Second—<q>Have you ever known any satisfactory<br/> instances of
                                reformation produced by the present, or<br/> any prison discipline?
                                And, if so, please to state the<br/> cases particularly, so far as
                                may be proper?</q></p>
<p>Answer—The general habits of intemperance pre-<br/>vious to the
                            confinement of convicts, and their ex-<br/>treme attachment to the use
                            of ardent spirits, has<br/> scarcely, in any instance, been cured even
                            by a long<br/> imprisonment; and their minds, owing to a number<br/> of
                            them being together during the night in one room,<br/> have been so
                            corrupted, that experience has proved,<br/> that reformation has rarely
                            taken place. During<br/> several years that I served as an inspector of
                            our<br/> state prison, I only recollect two cases of complete<br/>
                            reformation. One of these has resided many years<br/> in a neighbouring
                            government, the other, in this<br/> state; both are, at this time, men
                            of considerable pro-<br/>perty, much respected and well esteemed. It is
                            not<br/> known to their present friends and neighbours, that<br/> they
                            ever were under confinement. Each of them <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_073" n="79"></pb>were four
                            years in our state prison, and, on account<br/> of orderly conduct and
                            good behaviour, pardoned.</p>
<p>Third—<q>Has there been sufficient experience of<br/> solitary
                                confinement, to enable you to answer the<br/> same question in
                                relation to that mode of punish-<br/>ment? And so far as your
                                experience or observation<br/> may extend, please to state the
                                result?</q></p>
<p>Answer—There has been no experience in the state<br/> prison of
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, that would serve to
                            ascertain<br/> how far <emph rend="italic">continual</emph> solitary
                            confinement may eventu-<br/>ally produce reformation; recourse has only
                            been had<br/> to it, as a temporary punishment for bad conduct in<br/>
                            the prison—in this way it has produced good effects,<br/> and has
                            generally been the means of enforcing clean-<br/>liness, preserving
                            order, and good behaviour, even<br/> among the most hardened
                            convicts.</p>
<p>When I was a member of the Board of Inspectors,<br/> by-laws were
                            enacted, which declared, that all con-<br/>versation, (except such as
                            might be necessary whilst<br/> at work,) want of cleanliness, whistling,
                            attempting<br/> to sing, &amp;c., were offences against the laws of
                            the<br/> prison, and should meet with <emph rend="italic">immediate</emph> punishment,<br/> by confinement in a solitary cell
                            on bread and water,<br/> from one to three days, or longer, according to
                            the<br/> nature of the offence. By a faithful and rigid execu-<br/>tion
                            of these laws, the quiet and order of this prison<br/> was, with some
                            exceptions, perfectly preserved; and,<br/> as regarded neatness and
                            extreme cleanliness, no<br/> prison in the world could surpass it.</p>
<p>Fourth—<q>If you shall be of opinion that the pre-<br/>sent, or any
                                system of prison discipline, may be made<br/> to produce material
                                and permanent reformation in<br/> any large proportion of cases,
                                then be pleased to state<br/> how, and in what way, in your opinion,
                                it becomes<br/> operative towards that end? What are the
                                circum-<br/>stances in the system which will tend to change the<br/>
                                character of the convict, and how do they, or will<br/> they,
                                operate? What can be done to make them<br/> more effectual?</q>
</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_074" n="80"></pb>
<p>Answer—The subjoined general remarks, will serve<br/> as a reply to this
                            query.</p>
<p>Fifth—<q>Can you suggest any means by which the<br/> compulsory labour of
                                convicts, can be made to cover<br/> the expense of supporting and
                                guarding them? or<br/> any, by which the labour of the convicts of
                                this prison,<br/> can be made more productive than at
                            present?</q></p>
<p>Answer—I beg to make the same reference, as a<br/> reply to this
                            query.</p>
<p>Sixth—<q>Can you suggest any means by which the<br/> expense may be
                                diminished, and how? Can the guard<br/> be dispensed with? Can the
                                rations be lessened with<br/> propriety, or made cheaper?</q></p>
<p>Answer—If the prison was rightly constructed, no<br/> military guard
                            would be wanted; but, I apprehend<br/> the expenses of the prison in
                            this city cannot be<br/> diminished, unless the plan and construction of
                            it<br/> should be completely altered. Not being acquainted<br/> with the
                            quality and amount of the rations at present<br/> served to the
                            convicts, it is impossible for me to say<br/> how far they may, with
                            propriety, be lessened, or<br/> made cheaper.</p>
<p>Seventh—<q>Please to state briefly your views of the<br/> most effectual
                                system for the protection of society<br/> against crimes; and
                                therein note such alterations, if<br/> any, as you would suggest, in
                                the present system of<br/> management?</q></p>
<p>Answer—My views as to the most effectual means<br/> for protecting
                            society against crimes, will appear in<br/> the subsequent remarks.</p>
<p>GENERAL REMARKS.</p>
<p>Many reasons might be offered, why the success of<br/> the Penitentiary
                            System in this state has not been<br/> equal to the expectations of its
                            early patrons, and of<br/> the public at large.</p>
<p>1st. The inspectors have generally been changed<br/> with every change of
                            our political rulers; hence, men<br/> inadequate to the task, were
                            frequently appointed to <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_075" n="81"></pb>fill the important office of
                            inspectors. These fre-<br/>quent changes have produced a very great
                            increase<br/> of expenses, and materially tended to prevent
                            suita-<br/>ble and important improvements in the general
                            sys-<br/>tem.</p>
<p>2d. The number of pardons that have been grant-<br/>ed, has been attended
                            with most serious injury, and<br/> very much prevented the good effects
                            that the system<br/> might otherwise have produced. Pardon should
                            be<br/> granted only on the discovery of facts unknown at<br/> the
                            trial, which, if known, would probably have pro-<br/>duced an acquittal.
                            In fact, it may be truly said,<br/> that under a mild system, pardons
                            materially contri-<br/>bute to the increase of crimes.</p>
<p>3d. In the <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> prison, the rooms
                            lodge each<br/> about twenty convicts, and owing to so many being<br/>
                            brought together every night, they corrupt each other,<br/> and thus
                            prevent complete order in the prison, and<br/> all chance of reformation
                            is effectually defeated; the<br/> elder criminals serve as teachers to
                            the younger, and<br/> prepare them for the commission of greater
                            crimes<br/> than those for which they have been convicted. Thus<br/> the
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> prison, in place of
                            answering the pur-<br/>pose for which the convicts are confined, viz.
                            their<br/> reformation, becomes a nursery and seminary of vice.</p>
<p>4th. The authority given to the inspectors to in-<br/>flict corporal
                            punishment for violating the laws of<br/> the prison, respecting good
                            order, &amp;c. has no doubt<br/> had a very injurious effect, for, it is
                            directly opposite<br/> to the mild system that ought to prevail in a
                            peni-<br/>tentiary. It must tend to harden the minds of the<br/>
                            convicts, and materially lessen the chances of reform-<br/>ation. To
                            adopt such a mode of punishment, is<br/>extremely unwise, because the
                            more mild plan of<br/> occasional confinement in solitary cells on bread
                            and<br/> water, has been proved by experience, effectually to<br/>
                            answer the most important purposes of strict and<br/> rigid discipline.
                            The reasons above assigned are, in<br/> my opinion, sufficient to show
                            why the Penitentiary <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_076" n="82"></pb>System has failed to answer,
                            fully, the end and pur-<br/>poses for which it was intended,
                            particularly as it<br/> regards reformation.</p>
<p>I now shall respectfully offer for the consideration<br/> of the
                            commissioners, my views of the most effectual<br/> system for the
                            protection of society against crimes,<br/> and the most certain means to
                            promote the reforma-<br/>tion of convicts.</p>
<p>First. The great preventive of offences is doubtless<br/> an early
                            attention to moral and religious instruction,<br/> and thus to fortify
                            the infant mind with good princi-<br/>ples. The observation made by John
                            Locke, is re-<br/>markably appropriate and excellent:—<quote>I think, I
                                may<br/> say, that, of all the men we meet with, nine parts of<br/>
                                ten, are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by<br/> their
                                education.</quote> That a careful attention to educate<br/> the
                            children of parents in low circumstances through-<br/>out the State,
                            would go far towards the prevention<br/> of crimes, is demonstrated by
                            the fact, that in cons-<br/>quence of a diligent search being made by a
                            com-<br/>mittee of the <a href="/organizations/nyfss">New-York Free School Society<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>, it was<br/>
                            ascertained that but one boy of those who had re-<br/>ceived their
                            education in the schools of that institu-<br/>tion, had been convicted
                            of a petty crime, although<br/> several hundreds who had not been at the
                            Free<br/> Schools, had been tried at the Quarter Sessions, and<br/> been
                            committed to the City Penitentiary, for vagran-<br/>cy and various other
                            offences. We are told by high<br/> authority—<quote type="biblical">Train up a child in the way he should<br/> go, and when he is old,
                                he will not depart from it.</quote></p>
<p>The great error of all governments has been, not<br/> affording
                            instruction to the lower class of society,<br/> and inflicting
                            punishments often very disproportion-<br/>ate to offences. It is
                            evident, that civilization has not<br/> effected all the moral changes
                            and improvements that<br/> can be produced in the constitution of human
                            society,<br/> nor have laws and government been carried to the<br/>
                            utmost limits of perfection. It is, therefore, highly<br/> incumbent for
                            us to cherish the firm and unshaken<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_077" n="83"></pb>conviction, that it
                            is not beyond the bounds of hu-<br/>man effort to devise a system, that
                            will combine in<br/> its tendency, the <emph rend="italic">prevention</emph> of crimes, and the reform-<br/>ation of convicts.
                            Let us then ask any sagacious<br/> observer of human nature, what should
                            be the inci-<br/>pient step in order to protect society against
                            crime.<br/> The answer is plain. To afford them a common<br/> school
                            education, and fasten on their minds a know-<br/>ledge of their duties
                            towards God, and carefully in-<br/>struct them by means of the Holy
                            Scriptures, in the<br/> principles of the Christian religion. Let, then,
                            the<br/> present laws for common schools be cherished and<br/> improved,
                            in such manner as will oblige parents of<br/> the poorer classes in
                            society, to send their children to<br/> some one of the common schools,
                            to be instructed in<br/> reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in a
                            knowledge<br/> of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>By a legislative act, rules should be prescribed for<br/> enforcing a
                            strict regard to the perfect cleanliness of<br/> the persons of the
                            children, to their moral conduct, to<br/> oblige the teacher to read at
                            the opening of the school,<br/> daily, a chapter from a work entitled
                            Scripture Les-<br/>sons, which is, on many accounts, preferable to
                            the<br/> Bible for the use of schools, as it contains the most<br/>
                            important part of the Scriptures appertaining to vir-<br/>tue and good
                            morals. This book has been translated<br/> into most of the languages of
                            Europe, and is exten-<br/>sively used in the common schools in that
                            quarter of<br/> the globe, and also in the United States. To make<br/>
                            it the duty of all overseers of common schools, to em-<br/>ploy such
                            teachers only, as are men of suitable quali-<br/>fications, sober and
                            exemplary characters. Every<br/> inducement should be used to encourage
                            parents (in<br/> every place where it is practicable) to send their<br/>
                            children to school, as soon as they reach three years<br/> of age. This
                            might be done, by making it the duty<br/> of overseers of each school,
                            occasionally to visit the<br/> parents of the children, as has been done
                            by the trus-<br/>tees of the <a href="/organizations/nyfss">New-York Free School Society<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>.
                            Although<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_078" n="84"></pb>the latter have, at present, under their
                            care, above<br/> 4000 children, who receive a gratuitous education
                            at<br/> the schools under their charge ; yet, notwithstanding<br/> their
                            care and diligence in endeavouring to prevail<br/> on parents to send
                            their children to school, it is be-<br/>lieved that there are 8000
                            children in the city, who<br/> are brought up without the advantage of
                            school<br/> learning. An inspector might be appointed, in the<br/>
                            manner other officers of the state are appointed, who<br/> should be of
                            a respectable character and talents, and<br/> be allowed a good salary;
                            his duty should be to visit,<br/> once in each year, every common school
                            throughout<br/> the state, and inquire into the condition of each
                            school,<br/> the number of scholars; whether the laws of the state<br/>
                            are duly complied with; the salary, name, general<br/> character, and
                            qualifications of the teachers, and an<br/> account of all the receipts
                            and expenditures; he should<br/> make his report annually, to the
                            superintendent of<br/> common schools, who should be directed to
                            present<br/> the same to the legislature.</p>
<p>Next to providing for the moral and religious edu-<br/>cation of
                            children, by means of common schools<br/> throughout the state, it would
                            be productive of in-<br/>calculable advantage, to erect a suitable
                            prison, solely<br/> for the confinement of boys under sixteen years
                            of<br/> age, considered as vagrants, or guilty of petty thefts,<br/> or
                            other minor offences: it is believed that there are<br/> but few amongst
                            the most guilty of this description<br/> of juvenile delinquents, who
                            may not, by proper dis-<br/>cipline, be subdued and reclaimed, by the
                            establish-<br/>ment of a well-regulated prison for criminal youth.<br/>
                            In Massachusetts, there is a prison for young convicts<br/> in each
                            county. A number of the citizens of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, conceiving the great benefit that would
                            be de-<br/>rived, by erecting a suitable building for the reception<br/>
                            of such objects as has been described, have associated<br/> for the
                            purpose, and have been incorporated by the<br/> name of <q>The Society
                                for the Reformation of Juvenile<br/> Offenders in the city of
                                    <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.</q> This establish-
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_079" n="85"></pb>ment is in so great a state of forwardness as to
                            be<br/> nearly ready for the reception of suitable objects. It<br/> is
                            to be denominated the House of Refuge, and youth,<br/> not exceeding
                            sixteen or seventeen years of age, are<br/> to be committed there by the
                            criminal courts, instead<br/> of being sent to the City Penitentiary, or
                            State Prison,<br/> as has heretofore been the practice. At night
                            they<br/> are to lodge in separate cells, and during the day, to<br/> be
                            employed in some useful labour; they are to be<br/> instructed in
                            reading, writing, and arithmetic. The<br/> utmost degree of cleanliness
                            is to be strictly observed,<br/>throughout every part of the building;
                            and in the<br/> persons of the boys, good morals and decent
                            beha-<br/>viour, are to be rigidly maintained; the careful and<br/>
                            frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures is to be en-<br/>forced. The
                            trustees are empowered to bind them<br/> as apprentices, to the
                            sea-service, to a trade, or to<br/> farmers. A similar establishment
                            might be formed<br/> at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, to
                            serve for <a href="/places/troy">Troy<placename key="troy"></placename></a> and other towns on the<br/>
<geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname>, and the state might be
                            divided into con-<br/>venient districts, and one establishment of
                            this<br/> nature erected in each district.</p>
<p>A distinct and separate building should be erected on<br/> the premises
                            attached to the state prison, for the confine-<br/>ment of adults, males
                            and females, such as common<br/> drunkards, prostitutes, those who keep
                            houses of ill<br/> fame, or gambling-houses, or for those guilty of
                            small<br/> petty thefts, or vagrants. This prison should be
                            divi-<br/>ded into cells about the size of six feet by four.</p>
<p>A single magistrate should be vested with power to<br/>commit persons to
                            this prison from three to thirty days.<br/> Each prisoner should be
                            obliged to wash his face and<br/> hands every morning. Rigid care should
                            be taken<br/> to have each cell well ventilated, and kept perfectly<br/>
                            clean; and this care should be extended, as far as pos-<br/>sible, to
                            their clothes and personal appearance. He<br/> should be confined in a
                            separate cell, and fed only on<br/> bread and water, have no work, and
                            no bed, except<br/> a single blanket. The prisoners should be allowed
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_080" n="86"></pb>no tobacco, and should be deprived of every kind
                            of<br/> amusement; they should be permitted to have no<br/> books,
                            except the Bible, and perhaps it might be most<br/> beneficial that that
                            only be allowed them, when, in<br/> the judgment of the keeper, their
                            minds appeared to<br/> be in a disposition to read it with profit. No
                            person<br/> should be permitted to converse with any prisoner,<br/>
                            except the keeper, or those appointed to have the<br/> superintendence
                            of the prison, or a magistrate. If the<br/> prisoner be guilty of a
                            second offence, he should be<br/> tried for it, and receive such
                            punishment as the court,<br/> in their discretion, shall award him,
                            either to be re-<br/>committed, or sentenced to the state prison.</p>
<p> The plan of confining the above description of<br/> minor offenders in
                            solitude <emph rend="italic">without employment</emph> from<br/> three
                            to thirty days, cannot fail, frequently, of having<br/> the most
                            beneficial effect, as the prisoner will be then<br/> forced to reflect
                            on his past life. It may also tend to<br/> convince the convict that his
                            punishment is just; and,<br/> unless this effect be produced on the mind
                            of the<br/> prisoner, unless he be led to believe that his own<br/>
                            welfare, as well as the public good, is consulted in<br/> his
                            punishment, it will be in vain to expect reforma-<br/>tion ; but, on the
                            contrary, to confine a man in a soli-<br/>tary cell for months, or
                            years, is a punishment which<br/> may appear to the criminal
                            unnecessarily harsh and<br/> unjust, hardens his temper, and excites
                            those feelings<br/> of enmity towards his species, that the thought
                            of<br/> doing them an injury by the commission of new<br/> crimes is
                            gratifying to him.</p>
<p>If it should be urged that solitary confinement will<br/> be expensive,
                            it may be answered, that any expense<br/> which it can possibly
                            occasion, should be considered<br/> as nothing in comparison to the
                            accomplishment of<br/> the great object which it concerns. And, besides,
                            in<br/> proportion as crimes are lessened or decreased, or as<br/> they
                            are summarily punished, the expenses of the<br/> state, in relation to
                            the apprehension, detention, and<br/> prosecution of criminals, are
                            diminished.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_081" n="87"></pb>
<p>There is, as it appears to me, a moral and religious<br/> view of this
                            subject, which should not be without its<br/> influence. We are too apt
                            to forget while we are<br/> providing for the protection of persons and
                            property<br/> by passing laws for the punishment of crimes, that<br/>
                            the human beings who may become obnoxious to<br/> these laws, have also
                            their claims upon us. If it be<br/> admitted that the infliction of
                            solitude, from three to<br/> sixty days, for minor offences, will, while
                            it sup-<br/>presses criminality in an equal degree with any other<br/>
                            mode of punishment, also tend to reform the offender<br/> more than any
                            other course would do, we are bound<br/> by every feeling of humanity,
                            and by all the precepts<br/> of the christian religion, to adopt that
                            course which<br/> may raise a fellow-creature from degradation, fit
                            him<br/> for usefulness in this life, and prepare him for that<br/>
                            which is to come.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">State Prisons, or Penitentiaries.</emph>—Great
                            inconveni-<br/>ence, and apparent injustice, is frequently
                            produced,<br/> in making the distinction of the punishment of those<br/>
                            guilty of petty larceny, and those guilty of grand lar-<br/>ceny:—a
                            person charged with committing the <emph rend="italic">former</emph>,
                            is<br/> at present liable to be sentenced to the county prisons,<br/> at
                            hard labour, for a term not exceeding three years;<br/> and if guilty of
                            the <emph rend="italic">latter</emph>, for a term not less than<br/>
                            three years, or not exceeding fourteen years. To<br/> steal an article
                            of the value of twenty-five dollars, or<br/> less, is deemed petty
                            larceny; and, if the value of the<br/> article stolen exceeds
                            twenty-five dollars, it is termed<br/> grand larceny. So that the
                            stealing of a watch,<br/> valued at twenty-five dollars, is deemed petty
                            larceny,<br/> but if a watch, valued at twenty-six dollars, grand<br/>
                            larceny. Now, the moral turpitude being the same,<br/> it is therefore
                            certainly absurd to make any differ-<br/>ence in the punishment.</p>
<p>Although the moral turpitude of committing an<br/> offence, in law deemed
                                <emph rend="italic">petty</emph> larceny, may frequently<br/> be the
                            same as that denominated <emph rend="italic">grand</emph> larceny, I
                            do<br/> not mean to contend that there should be no line of <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_082" n="88"></pb>distinction to mark the difference between them; but<br/>
                            considering that, in order to graduate the punishment<br/> as near as
                            possible to the nature of the offence, much<br/> must necessarily be
                            left to the discretion of the court,<br/> I would respectfully suggest
                            the propriety of an alter-<br/>vation in our penal code, so as that
                            petty larceny,<br/> should consist in stealing articles not exceeding
                            the<br/> value of one hundred dollars. If this were done, the<br/>
                            convict might be sentenced to a longer or shorter<br/> confinement,
                                <emph rend="italic">according to his general character</emph>,
                            and<br/> other circumstances, and <emph rend="italic">not according to
                                the value of<br/> the goods stolen</emph>. An old offender stealing
                            goods to<br/> the value of ten dollars, should certainly, in most<br/>
                            cases, be punished with more severity than a <emph rend="italic">young</emph><br/> offender stealing to the value of <emph rend="italic">fifty</emph> dollars. Unless<br/> there be a careful
                            and due discrimination of charac-<br/>ter, in fixing duration of
                            punishment, courts may<br/> frequently commit extreme and barefaced
                            injustice.<br/> It is equally as sound a maxim in jurisprudence as<br/>
                            in morals, <said who="undetermined">that he who punishes another for
                                offend-<br/>ing against justice, should himself be just.</said></p>
<p>The state prison in this city is so badly contrived,<br/> that it never
                            can be successfully used as a Penitenti-<br/>ary ; it should be sold,
                            and a new one erected a few<br/> miles from the city, constructed on the
                            same plan as<br/> the state prison at <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>, to have separate cells, so<br/> that the
                            prisoners might lodge separately. Every cell<br/> should be properly
                            ventilated by means of a small<br/> aperture next the ceiling, of three
                            inches diameter.</p>
<p> The prisoners ought to be kept constantly employ-<br/>ed at such work as
                            the overseers of the prison should<br/> think most suitable. To purchase
                            raw materials to<br/> be worked up in the prison, has frequently been
                            at-<br/>tended with loss, owing to want of skill in purchas-<br/>ing,
                            and bad management in disposing of manufac-<br/>tured articles to the
                            best advantage. The most<br/> preferable plan would be, to make
                            contracts for<br/> the labour of the convicts, with shoe makers,
                            stone-cut-<br/>ters, &amp;c. &amp;c. the contractors furnishing the raw
                            ma-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_083" n="89"></pb>terials; but no contractor should be allowed to
                            enter<br/> the prison, or to have any intercourse whatever with<br/> the
                            convicts. The prisoners might safely be employ-<br/>ed during the day in
                            the yards, and effectually pre-<br/>vented from all improper intercourse
                            or conversation<br/> with each other, provided the prison discipline,
                            before<br/> recommended in the answer to the third query, be<br/>
                            rigidly enforced. The cells should not be used, ex-<br/>cept to confine
                            a convict on a low diet, when he vio-<br/>lates any by-law of the
                            prison. The by-laws relating<br/> to the government of the convicts,
                            such as preserving<br/> the greatest degree of cleanliness in the
                            persons, and<br/> in the rooms, halls, kitchen, and throughout
                            every<br/> part of the prison, &amp;c. should be very minutely
                            de-<br/>tailed, printed and fixed in different parts of the<br/> prison,
                            and no offence against those rules should ever<br/> escape being
                            punished, under any pretence whatever.</p>
<p>The confinement of criminals in a solitary cell du-<br/>ring the whole
                            time of their sentence, say, from one<br/> to five years, or more,
                            appears to be unnecessarily<br/> severe. Suppose the term of his
                            punishment to be<br/> three years, and that he should have some kind of
                            <br/>daily employment, yet it appears to me, that the pro-<br/>ject is
                            cruel and unjust, as it is highly probable<br/> the health of the
                            convict would be impaired if not de-<br/>stroyed, and in many cases it
                            would produce insanity.<br/> We well know, that cruel and severe
                            punishment<br/> has never proved sufficient to deter persons from
                            per-<br/>petrating crimes; and to confine a man for years in<br/> a
                            solitary cell, will be more likely to harden his<br/> mind, and
                            brutalize his disposition, than to produce<br/> his reformation. I am
                            very willing to admit, that<br/> the observations I have made, may not
                            be correct in<br/> every instance, as cases may occur, that will serve
                            to<br/> prove, that a man may be confined in solitude for<br/> several
                            years without injury to his health, and also<br/> that reformation has
                            effected its perfect work; but I<br/> am well assured that such
                            instances would very sel-<br/>dom occur.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_084" n="90"></pb>
<p>It is acknowledged by all, who have reflected on<br/> the best means of
                            establishing a penitentiary system,<br/><said who="undetermined">most
                                likely to protect society against crimes,</said> that<br/> the
                            construction of the building should be such, as to<br/> prevent the
                            convicts from improper intercourse with<br/> each other; and that it is
                            impossible this important<br/> end can be attained, unless each be at
                            night lodged<br/> separately in a cell. It is in vain to expect any<br/>
                            beneficial effects under the best regulations that can<br/> be devised,
                            if the prison admit a number of prisoners<br/> to lodge in one room.</p>
<p>During the day they may be employed with safety<br/> in the yards, under
                            the charge of keepers, and by a<br/> rigid discipline, all improper
                            intercourse prevented;<br/> this has been fully demonstrated by my own
                            expe-<br/>rience as an inspector, during the first four years<br/> after
                            the state prison in this city was erected. It is<br/> only necessary to
                            punish any offender the moment he<br/> commits an offence, by
                            confinement in a solitary cell<br/> on bread and water. No person should
                            be allowed<br/> to visit the prison, unless accompanied by a
                            magis-<br/>trate or one of the inspectors. In the foregoing part<br/> of
                            this communication, I have stated my sentiments, on<br/> the
                            indispensable necessity of preserving the most per-<br/>fect degree of
                            cleanliness, in the person of the prisoners,<br/> and throughout the
                            prison, as it will produce the<br/> best moral effects in the
                            preservation of order, and<br/> aid materially in the reformation of the
                            convicts.</p>
<p>No undue severity should be exercised towards<br/> prisoners. The best
                            general system of government<br/> and management is by mild
                            treatment.</p>
<p> The plan of fixing tasks, or agreeing to make al-<br/>lowance for extra
                            work performed by convicts, ought<br/> not to be adopted; it is bad
                            policy, as it tends to<br/> lessen too much the principle of punishment.
                            It<br/> would be much better to give the convict, when dis-<br/>charged
                            on the expiration of his sentence, a small<br/> sum to serve him till he
                            can get into a situation to<br/> earn something by his own industry, and
                            if he be<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_085" n="91"></pb>inclined to endeavour to go to work, from three
                            to five<br/> dollars will be sufficient to give him, and if he has
                            no<br/> disposition to seek for employment, to give him even<br/> a
                            small sum would most likely prove an injury. If<br/> he has not learned
                            any regular trade, he can soon <br/>get employment on a farm or in the
                            city as a labourer.<br/> In England the state of things is widely
                            different<br/> to what it is in this country, and it may there be<br/>
                            more necessary, that convicts during their confine-<br/>ment should
                            learn some trade.</p>
<p>A school in the evening should be established, and<br/> on the First day
                            of the week they should be assem-<br/>bled for the purpose of Divine
                            Worship, and a chapter<br/> in the Bible should be read to them every
                            morning<br/> or evening.</p>
<p>In selecting inspectors, care should be taken that<br/> they are highly
                            respectable men, capable of perform-<br/>ing the duties of their office,
                            and who would act<br/> solely from benevolent motives, with a religious
                            view<br/> to benefit their fellow creatures. Much would depend<br/> on
                            their dispositions and exertions, and on their occa-<br/>sionally giving
                            to the convicts suitable religious and<br/> moral advice. <quote>Gradual
                                changes may be effected<br/> even in the worst of men, by a steady,
                                firm, and<br/> persevering attention to correct their acquired
                                bad<br/> habits.</quote> Those who assert (and there are many<br/>
                            respectable men who make the assertion) that to<br/> attempt to reform
                            convicts, by exercising kind and<br/> conciliatory means, is chimerical
                            and absurd, cer-<br/>tainly do not reflect, that to advise and admonish
                            the<br/> most profligate and abandoned, is the usual practice<br/> of
                            life, and is solemnly enjoined by the precepts of<br/> the Founder of
                            our holy religion. We ought not to<br/> refrain from using such means as
                            may be in our<br/> power, to produce an amendment and change in the<br/>
                            dispositions of convicts, from an apprehension that<br/> a <emph rend="italic">complete</emph> reformation cannot be expected.
                            The<br/> employments that would be the most suitable for<br/> the
                            prisoners, ought to be left to the discretion of the <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_086" n="92"></pb>inspectors, and also the sole power to appoint the<br/> keeper, agent,
                            and other officers, and to remove them<br/> in case of improper conduct,
                            or want of sufficient<br/> qualifications to discharge their respective
                            duties.</p>
<p>I do not approve of dividing the prisoners into dif-<br/>ferent classes,
                            and distinguishing each class by dif-<br/>ferent coloured clothing; and,
                            if the plan I have pro-<br/>posed be adopted, of having separate prisons
                            for the<br/> different descriptions of convicts, this plan of
                            classi-<br/>fication in any one prison will be useless, except<br/>
                            having a separate yard for those committed for second<br/> offences.</p>
<p>The different prisons I have proposed, might be<br/> built adjoining each
                            other, but to have separate yards.<br/> The whole might be under the
                            same board of inspec-<br/>tors. Recapitulation of my views of the most
                            effectual<br/> system for the protection of society against crimes:</p>

<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> answered these inquiries, and others
                    in<br/>different walks of life took up the pen. Among them<br/> was <a href="/people/ccold1">Cadwallader D. Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>, Esq., who wrote as a<br/>
                    lawyer, and a man of philanthropy and experience,<br/> and his work is valuable
                    to all who make the sub-<br/>ject a matter of inquiry. That bold and
                    original<br/> thinker, <a href="/people/ccald2">Doctor Charles
                    Caldwell<persname key="ccald2"></persname></a>, of Transylvania<br/> University, also wrote upon state
                    prison discipline,<br/> and in a striking manner connected the subject with<br/>
                    his favourite science, phrenology. <a href="/people/ccald2">Dr.
                        Caldwell<persname key="ccald2"></persname></a>'s<br/> book should be read to set people a thinking, for
                    his<br/> singularity is not more striking than his bold and<br/> clear logic. We
                    may differ from him in many things,<br/> but we feel indebted to a man who
                    teaches us to<br/> reason.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> lived to see his state prison
                    discipline<br/> carried into effect in several States of the Union, which<br/>
                    was acknowledged to be the greatest improvement of <br/>the age. Since his
                    death, this system has received the<br/> approbation of the enlightened
                    philosopher, Dr. Lei-<br/> ber, in the Encyclopaedia Americana, under the
                    arti-<br/>cle Prison Discipline, who says, referring to <a href="/people/salle1">Allen<persname key="salle1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/gtibb1">Tibbits<persname key="gtibb1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/shopk1">Hopkins<persname key="shopk1"></persname></a>, </p>
<floatingtext type="undetermined">
<p>The result of the wise la-<br/>bours of these excellent men was the
                            perfecting of a<br/> scheme of prison discipline, which had been
                            begun<br/> partially at <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>, and
                            which is substantially the<br/> model on which the reforms attempted in
                            most of the<br/> other States have been conducted. It consists,
                            prin-<br/>cipally, of the solitary confinement of the convicts<br/>
                            during the night, and the time of taking their meals;<br/> of labour
                            during the day; and of silence at all times,<br/> except for the
                            purposes of communication with their<br/> keepers; they are never
                            allowed to address each other,<br/> not even by signs or looks. The
                            strictest supervision<br/> is, of course, necessary, to secure
                            uninterrupted and<br/> industrious labour, and to prevent the evil
                            communi-<br/>cations which would otherwise abound. The advan-<br/>tages
                            of this system are, that it affords an opportunity<br/> alternately for
                            silent and solitary reflection, for the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_088" n="94"></pb>salutary
                            reflection of the mind upon itself; and for<br/> that mental activity
                            upon other objects, and that re-<br/>laxation from the severer task of
                            thinking, which is<br/> at once necessary to preserve the healthy state
                            of the<br/> mind and body, and to give efficacy to the meditation<br/>
                            which is thus encouraged. But this alternation of<br/> labour and
                            reflection is not the only, nor, perhaps, the<br/> greatest advantage of
                            the plan. The unaided thoughts<br/> of the corrupt and hardened might
                            recur to topics<br/> which would be any thing but salutary; but, in
                            the<br/> silence and darkness of night, the voice of religious<br/>
                            instruction is heard; and, if any circumstances can<br/> be imagined,
                            calculated to impress the warnings, the<br/> encouragements, the
                            threats, or the hopes of religion<br/> upon the mind, it must surely be
                            those of the convict<br/> in his cell, where he is unseen and unheard,
                            and<br/> where nothing can reach him but the voice which<br/> must come
                            to him, as it were, from another world,<br/> telling him of things
                            which, perhaps, never before<br/> entered into his mind; telling him of
                            God, of eter-<br/>nity, of future reward and future punishment, of
                            suf-<br/>fering far greater than the mere physical endurances<br/> of
                            the present life, and of joy infinitely beyond the<br/> pleasures he may
                            have experienced. These instruc-<br/>tions frequently discover to the
                            guilty tenant of the<br/> cell, what seems often not to have occurred to
                            him,<br/> the simple fact, that he has a spiritual nature; that he<br/>
                            is not the mere animal which his habits and hitherto<br/> uncontrolled
                            propensities would indicate; and this is<br/> a discovery which alone
                            may, and does effect, a great<br/> change in a man's whole character. He
                            feels that he<br/> is a being superior to what he had thought
                            himself,<br/> and that he is regarded as one having higher powers<br/>
                            than he had supposed. The first step in the path of<br/> improvement is
                            a prodigious one; a new ambition is<br/> created, and the encouragement
                            of it is the principal<br/> thing now needed. This encouragement it is
                            part of<br/> the system to give. The spiritual guide of this
                            out-<br/>cast flock must study the character and previous cir-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_089" n="95"></pb>cumstances of every individual; he must adapt him-<br/>self
                            and his instructions to their wants; he must<br/> teach the ignorant,
                            arouse the careless, touch, if it be<br/> possible, the impenitent, lead
                            the willing, and be <quote type="biblical">all<br/> things to all men,
                                if by any means he may save<br/> some.</quote> To the morning and
                            evening services of de-<br/>votion, are to be added the more direct and
                            elaborate<br/> instructions of the Sabbath, and the no less
                            important<br/> influences which may be effected in private
                            inter-<br/>course with the convict. The Sunday school may<br/>
                            communicate the most valuable information on many<br/> subjects; and
                            every improper influence may be, and<br/> ought to be, absolutely
                            excluded. It is this system<br/> of addressing the intellectual and
                            moral qualities of<br/> man, of treating the convict as a being of a
                            compound<br/> nature—both physical and spiritual—that constitutes<br/>
                            the peculiar merit of the prison discipline, which is<br/> now about to
                            be introduced. No new discovery has<br/> been made, unless it be
                            considered one that criminals<br/> may sometimes be made susceptible of
                            moral influ-<br/>ences. It is only the adaptation of well known
                            prin-<br/>ciples to a new class of subjects. It is merely carry-<br/>ing
                            to the lowest, the most ignorant, and the most<br/> degraded class, that
                            plan of education which is nearly<br/> universal among us, and which
                            should be entirely so<br/> every where. The exercise of mere force,
                            which has<br/> been so long considered the only means of
                            punish-<br/>ment, is at length yielding to the rapidly
                            strength-<br/>ening conviction of the superior efficacy of moral<br/>
                            influence.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>At the same time <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was labouring to
                    change<br/> the penal code of the state of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                        York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and estab-<br/>lish his penitentiary system, his mind was
                    deeply<br/> engaged upon other charities. An <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> had been<br/> founded in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, by the munificence<br/> of individuals,
                    011 this and on the other side of the<br/> water, a few years before the
                    commencement of the<br/> revolutionary war; but that momentous event
                    chang-<br/>ed the whole course of things in this country, and <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_090" n="96"></pb>the <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> suffered with other
                    institutions. On<br/> the return of peace, this charity seemed still
                    warm<br/>with life, but was not reanimated until after the<br/> adoption of the
                    Federal constitution. This act,<br/> which gave strength, vigour and reputation
                    to the <br/>nation, was soon followed by great exertions. In<br/> less than two
                    years after the constitution went into<br/> operation, the hospital was open for
                    the reception<br/> of patients. The legislature had lent a helping hand;<br/>
                    but it was not until <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, in <date when="1793">1793</date>, was elected<br/> one of the governors of this
                    institution, that great and<br/> liberal things were done for it. At this time,
                    the<br/> Board met but once in three months; he proposed<br/> that the Board
                    should meet once a month. This<br/> was agreed to, and new life was given to
                    these<br/> meetings by plans proposed by Mr. Eddy. There was<br/> a field back
                    of the <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> of seven acres, which<br/>
                    might have been purchased for one hundred pounds<br/> an acre, and he urged the
                    Board to buy it without<br/> delay, but in this he was, unfortunately for the
                    insti-<br/>tution, overruled; yet nothing abated his ardour in the<br/> cause of
                    this charity. The annual allowance from<br/> the legislature to the hospital was
                    five thousand dol-<br/>lars, and this was limited to four years. In <date when="1795">1795</date>,<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, being at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, held a communication<br/> with that prince of
                    patriotism and benevolence, <a href="/people/pschu1">Gen.
                    Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>.* <note rend="asterisk">* See Appendix. </note> He prevailed
                    on him to introduce a bill in<br/> the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>,
                    which passed into a law, giving the Hos-<br/>pital ten thousand dollars a year
                    for four years.<br/> The next year <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                    again visited <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and<br/>procured the
                    passage of a law adding twenty-five<br/> hundred dollars a year to the former
                    grant. In <date when="1800">1800</date>,<br/><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.

                    procured an exten-<br/>sion of the grant for five years. Notwithstanding<br/>
                    this liberality, the governors could not extend their<br/> plans according to
                    their wishes, and they did the<br/> best they could until <date when="1806">1806</date>, when they again sent<br/> their faithful representative with a
                    petition, the <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_091" n="97"></pb>prayer of which was for an extension of these
                    grants<br/> for fifty years, and it was allowed. The indefati-<br/>gable
                    philanthropist did not become wearied in his<br/> cause, for in <date when="1810">1810</date> he again succeeded in getting an<br/> additional sum
                    of three thousand five hundred dol-<br/>lars for ten years, or during the
                    pleasure of the legis-<br/>lature ; at this time, the <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> was in the receipt<br/> of sixteen thousand dollars a
                    year. This last act of<br/> the Assembly was repealed in <date when="1817">1817</date>, and the income<br/> from the State reduced to twelve thousand
                    five hun-<br/>dred dollars.</p>
<p>Early in the year <date when="1815">1815</date>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.

                    propriety of introducing an in-<br/>stitution for lunatic patients, more
                    extensive than<br/> had heretofore been in existence in this country.<br/> The
                    communication is full of good sense without any<br/> pretensions; and, although
                    all the sentiments it con-<br/>tains are now familiar to us, they were novel
                    then<br/> to most of those who had paid attention to the sub-<br/>ject of
                    insanity. This communication is mentioned<br/> in the history of the hospital,
                    and the proceedings<br/> had thereon.</p>
<p>An appeal was again made to the legislature for<br/> assistance, and <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was requested to proceed<br/> to <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> and present a memorial, but this he
                    de-<br/>clined for various reasons. It is a painful and labo-<br/>rious task to
                    attend a winter session of a delibera-<br/>tive body, and he thought he had done
                    more than<br/> his share of this labour. No one can tell how irksome<br/> it is
                    to talk with hundreds of persons, clothed with<br/> authority, often captious,
                    sometimes suspecting self-<br/>ishness, and generally impatient listeners,
                    when<br/> caught in the lobbies or out of doors; and then it is<br/> natural for
                    every man to feel an aversion to any one<br/> who often comes on errands of
                    solicitation. To do<br/> much and offend but few, was the peculiar gift of<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>. The Governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> would<br/> not vote to relieve him from
                    this duty, but particular-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_092" n="98"></pb>ly evaded the subject by leaving it
                    to <a href="/people/pjay1">Peter A. Jay<persname key="pjay1"></persname></a>,<br/> Esq. then a member of the
                    legislature, a gentleman<br/> of talents and weight of character. <a href="/people/pjay1">Mr. Jay<persname key="pjay1"></persname></a> went to<br/>
<a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, hut after a while wrote to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> to come<br/> to his assistance. The appeal
                    was made in such<br/> strong terms, that he could not resist it, and he set<br/>
                    out for <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and with the exertions of
                        <a href="/people/pjay1">Mr. Jay<persname key="pjay1"></persname></a>,<br/> an act was passed, giving ten
                    thousand dollars a year<br/> for the support of the insane, and for erecting
                    new<br/> buildings. This act was limited by the act <said who="undetermined">for<br/> the better support of the hospital,</said> which granted<br/>
                    twelve thousand five hundred dollars for fifty years.<br/> Probably many members
                    had forgotten when the act<br/> would expire, and those who did remember
                    the<br/> fact, did not choose to say any thing about it. View-<br/>ed in any
                    light, it was a liberal donation for a noble<br/> purpose. Nearly eighty acres
                    of land were pur-<br/>chased at <a href="/places/bloomd">Bloomingdale<placename key="bloomd"></placename></a>, and a fine building erected<br/> for the
                    accommodation of the insane. The success<br/> of his exertions, and those of his
                    coadjutors, gave<br/>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> the liveliest pleasure, which he took
                    no<br/>pains to disguise. He always felt himself an in-<br/>structor of those
                    whose minds were sickly, and he<br/> believed that, though it was difficult, yet
                    it was not<br/> impossible to<br/>
<quote>Minister to a mind diseased;<br/> Pluck from the memory a rooted

                    derangement is one of deep<br/> interest to the philanthropist. To mark insanity
                    in<br/> all its various forms, to go back to the cause of its<br/> existence,
                    whether moral, physical, or accidental,<br/> requires acuteness and constant
                    observation. The<br/> wise and the kind feel assured that they carry with<br/>
                    them many cures and a thousand anodynes for mise-<br/>ry. Those who devote a
                    life to doing good, in cu-<br/>ring or soothing the maladies of the mind,
                    improve <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_093" n="99"></pb>their own intellects, and at the same time are
                    learn-<br/>ing lessons for the government of their own passions,<br/> and
                    purifying their own affections. They find that<br/> the furious maniac yields to
                    gentle firmness, when<br/> he would rave at severity; that melancholy may
                    be<br/> banished by the voice of cheerfulness and kindness,<br/> when it would
                    grow deeper if attacked by boiste-<br/>rous harshness; and that even demency may
                    be<br/> quickened into life and mental action by proper<br/> moral sentiments.
                    It is an acknowledged fact, that<br/> those who have the care of the insane are
                    generally<br/> cheerful; one cause of which may be, that they feel<br/>
                    conscious of being in the way of doing good, and the<br/> effects of their
                    exertions are constantly before them;<br/> and, perhaps, another is, that the
                    same mind is unceas-<br/>ingly dwelling upon the blessings it enjoys in its<br/>
                    sanity, and draws comparisons between itself, and<br/> those unfortunate beings
                    who are deprived of reason,<br/> as we take a more elastic step when we pass a
                    crip-<br/>ple, who moves on slowly in his deformity and an-<br/>guish, or as we
                    look at the sun, or some bright object,<br/> and see that the petitioner for
                    street alms is blind.</p>
<p>The Indians within the United States have been<br/> harassed, warred upon, driven
                    from their primitive<br/> abodes, and, at times, hunted down as beasts of
                    the<br/> forest. Sometimes they were sinned against, but <br/>often sinning in
                    the causes which produced this dis-<br/>tress. They thought this whole continent
                    their own,<br/> and that they were sole proprietors of it. Their<br/> ideas of
                    national rights and of political economy<br/> were not very extensive, but their
                    patriotism and<br/> courage will never be doubted by those acquainted<br/> with
                    their history. At times, they seemed to wish to<br/> be friends; at other times,
                    were vindictive and blood-<br/>thirsty.</p>
<p>The Eastern Indians were among the fiercest on<br/> the continent. <a href="/people/metac1">King Philip<persname key="metac1"></persname></a> is a noble instance of<br/> sagacity and
                    love of country ; and the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, so<br/>
                    well known in the history of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, were
                    brave, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_094" n="100"></pb>and most generally faithful to their treaties. But
                    it<br/> often happened, that when the philosopher was con-<br/>templating them
                    as patriots and warriors, he heard<br/> of some of their massacres and
                    conflagrations, and<br/> his resentment arose against them at their
                    barbarous<br/> disposition. Or, he saw them through the medium<br/> of taste,
                    and was disgusted with their filthy habits<br/> and wandering course of life.
                    When <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> began<br/> his career of active
                    philanthropy, the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a> had<br/> been so
                    far reduced as not to be feared, but rather to<br/> be pitied. Their case came
                    within the view of the<br/> charities of his religious order, and he made
                    himself<br/> acquainted with their situation, their habits, and cha-<br/>racter.
                    In <date when="1793">1793</date>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,
                    with his friend, <a href="/people/jmurr1">John Mur-ray<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>, junior,
                    visited the <a href="/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondaga<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> Indians, to get more accurate<br/>information in regard
                    to them, and see if some plan<br/> could not be devised to ameliorate their
                    condition.<br/> At this time, the west was a wild; <a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a>, now so con-<br/>siderable a place, then contained but
                    three houses.<br/> From <a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a> they travelled
                    on an Indian path to<br/><geogname key="cayug">Cayuga lake</geogname>, and
                    attended the meeting for making<br/> a treaty, held by <a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>, and other com-<br/>missioners, with the
                    Indians, seven hundred of whom<br/> were present. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, and his friend <a href="/people/jmurr1">Murray<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a>,
                    on<br/> their return, made so favourable a report to the<br/>
<said who="undetermined"><a href="/organizations/pymind">Yearly Meeting Committee for
                            the improvement of the Indians<orgname key="pymind"></orgname></a>,</said> that for several
                    years—and I never have<br/> heard that the Friends had relinquished their
                    exer-<br/>tions in the cause—considerable sums were appropri-<br/>ated to
                    instruct and civilize them. He was not very<br/> sanguine, in this charity, of
                    doing much good, notwith-<br/>standing the great interest he took in the welfare
                    of<br/> the Indians. He saw that their original character<br/> was every day
                    changing, and that the whites, some-<br/>times honestly, and by fair contract,
                    but often impro-<br/>perly, were encroaching on their grounds: but there<br/>
                    was another side to the question; a race of industrious<br/> men, adorned with
                    all the arts and sciences of civi-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_095" n="101"></pb>lization, was growing up and
                    occupying a space for<br/> a village, where thousands were supported, that
                    would<br/> not have furnished <said who="undetermined">room and verge
                        enough</said> for a<br/> dozen aboriginal hunters, according to their
                    notions<br/>of life. But, if such men as <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had been in<br/> the Council for Indian affairs, the tribes
                    would have<br/> faded away, if that is their fate—and who can doubt<br/>
                    it?—with less suffering and less repining than is now<br/> witnessed. His
                    hospitable mansion was a wigwam<br/> to the travelling Indian, where he drank
                    when thirsty<br/> and ate when hungry. He sometimes had a dozen<br/> Indians,
                    men, women, and children, in the house at<br/> once. Among his Indian
                    acquaintance, was the fa-<br/>mous <a href="/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>,
                    of the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> tribe. This chief<br/> was a
                    warrior and orator of high intellectual powers<br/> and commanding mien. His
                    head was the admira-<br/>tion of the phrenologist, and his rifle was as
                    un-<br/>erring as death. This man exhibited all that was<br/> noble in the
                    savage; he was brave, sagacious, and<br/> patriotic, but he yielded to the
                    weakness of intem-<br/>perance, and showed the worst as well as the best<br/>
                    qualities of their fallen nature. His tribe once de-<br/>posed him from power as
                    a chief, for his imprudence;<br/> but he had energy of character enough to
                    redeem<br/> himself, and regain his power in his tribe—a singu-<br/>lar
                    occurrence in savage or civil life. To <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a> was a
                    study, and so was <a href="/people/teddy1">Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> to <a href="/people/redja1">RedJacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>, for he, too, with all his
                    fierceness, was a phi-<br/>lanthropist and a philosopher. Since <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s death,<br/>the state of the Indians has
                    excited much feeling in the<br/>community, but the time is rapidly approaching,
                    when<br/> this subject will only be a bygone tale. In New Eng-<br/>land, there
                    are a few remnants of several once power-<br/>ful tribes, but they are mixed
                    with the Africans, and<br/>have no importance in the community. Though
                    some<br/>of their ancient territories are, in some instances, ap-<br/>propriated
                    to their use, and the States act as guardians,<br/> in order that these shall
                    not be taken from them. In<br/>
<a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six
                        Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, once so powerful, are now<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_096" n="102"></pb>fast
                    declining, and in the Western States of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>,<br/>
<a href="/places/kentu">Kentucky<placename key="kentu"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/misss">Mississippi<placename key="misss"></placename></a>, they are nearly annihila-<br/>ted. Beyond the
                    settlements, there are a few who<br/> have maintained their independence, but
                    these soon<br/> will share the fate of other nations of aborigines on<br/> this
                    continent. But, if we must come to these melan-<br/>choly conclusions, we ought
                    not to forget that there<br/> have been philanthropists who have struggled to
                    save<br/> them, and to press upon them the arts, and teach <br/>them the value
                    of civilization and Christianity. The <br/>following letters will show how much
                    has been done.</p>

<salute>BROTHERS,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Our ears have been open to hear from you these<br/> many days, but have
                            not heard a word. And we<br/> suppose you also have expected to hear our
                            welfare,<br/> and have not heard one word.</p>
<p>Brothers—With pleasure we have retained the good<br/>counsels you given
                            us when you were here our place.<br/> We have been endeavoured to follow
                            the way you<br/> pointed out for us. Now we will also inform you
                            <br/>that our nation at large enjoy their health ever since<br/> you
                            left us. This, we acknowledge, is merely from<br/> the <emph rend="italic">good Spirit</emph>. We are sorry to hear that many
                            of<br/> our white brothers at <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, have been taken<br/> away by death. This, also, we
                            believe, is by the<br/> will of the same <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>.</p>
<p>Brothers—We believe that you have heard the<br/> childish conduct of our
                            brethren, the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, with<br/> regard
                            to their land affairs, therefore, 'tis needless that<br/> we should say
                            any thing about it.</p>
<p>As we look upon you to be our true Friends, we<br/> write to you as such;
                            you are sincerely wished that<br/> our poor Nations should be build up
                            so as to become<br/> civilized people; we, also, have an earnest wish
                            for<br/> the same. We ever have endeavoured to promote the
                            happi-<br/>ness of our Nation here, but our depend ance is
                            wholly<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_097" n="103"></pb>on him who is able to do more for us than we
                            can<br/> ask. Still, we believe, that in some respects he will<br/> not
                            do any thing without our endeavours.</p>
<p> Brothers—By your good counsels, you have given<br/> us good
                            encouragement to go on in the good way,<br/> and although we have been
                            endeavoured to do what<br/> we have told you, but as we are new
                            beginners we<br/> find ourselves to be as children who could not
                            walk<br/> strait or go alone without little help by some Friend.</p>
<p>And we also find some real obstructions in the way<br/> which we can
                            avoid if we can get some help. And<br/> as you are our Friends, we will
                            open our minds<br/> freely unto you. Here we have upwards than
                            sixty<br/> families who are not acquainted how to make cloth<br/> of no
                            kind; it has been therefore necessary for each<br/> one to go out from
                            the Town, at times, to seek some<br/> articles of clothing among the
                            white traders; and<br/> the traders generally set up great price on
                            their<br/> goods.</p>
<p>In this way of living, among so many families,<br/> have spend many many
                            a days in one year. Besides<br/> all this, there are some Indians who,
                            while they seek-<br/>ing where to purchase some necessary articles
                            for<br/> their poor families, they have been overtaken by the<br/>
                            strong Heroe, and robbed by him, and come home<br/> almost naked and
                            starved.</p>
<p>Brothers—This is one obstruction on our way; in<br/> order to avoid it,
                            we would ask your assistance. If<br/> you can find it in your minds so
                            as to do it with<br/> ease to trust us few articles of clothing, that we
                            may<br/> keep little store in our Town, that our people may<br/> not
                            spend much of their time as they have done, and <br/>that the white
                            traders may not take all the advan-<br/>tages on this respect as they
                            always did. And the<br/> great Heroe (whose name is <emph rend="italic">Rum</emph>) should not rob<br/> our Indians as he has done these
                            many years. This<br/> means will fasten our Nation at one place, we
                            the<br/> subscribers, engage to pay you at such a time as we<br/> may
                            agree. If such thing can take place here, it <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_098" n="104"></pb>would
                            also great deal help our brethren, the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a><br/> and <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroras<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a>. This, Brothers, is our request—and<br/> we
                            leave it to your consideration—and desire to hear<br/> your voices as
                            soon as you can find it convenient to<br/> send answer. This is all what
                            we have to say.</p>

<salute>BROTHERS,</salute></opener>
<p>A few days ago we received your letter, dated<br/>
<date when="1795-11-19">19th of last month</date>. The account you give
                            us of your<br/> welfare affords us much satisfaction, and we
                            rejoice<br/> to find that you retained the counsel and advice we<br/>
                            gave to you at <a href="/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a>, and our
                            written commu-<br/>nications at <a href="/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>. We hope you will dili-<br/>gently attend
                            to the voice of the good Spirit, which<br/> is placed in all men's
                            hearts, and which is all sufficient<br/> to lead out of all bad
                            practices—and as you closely<br/> pursue those ways which is consistent
                            with this<br/> divine Spirit, you will witness, by experience, that
                            it<br/> will be your strength, your good Counsellor, and your<br/> true
                            Comforter. Since our return home we have been <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_099" n="105"></pb>very
                            thoughtful about our Indian Brethren, and in-<br/>tended soon to have
                            wrote to you.</p>
<p>Our minds, as well as your other Friends in this<br/> city, have been
                            much employed in thinking in what<br/> way we could best serve you; we
                            are sensible you<br/> want assistance, and we are very desirous of
                            helping<br/> you to become Farmers, and learn some useful trades,<br/>
                            so that you may not find it necessary to go so much<br/> out among the
                            white people, which has been already<br/> of great hurt to your young
                            men, by exposing them<br/> to be overtaken by the great Hero, as you
                            very justly<br/> observe. But, Brothers, we must tell you in plain<br/>
                            words, that unless you are in earnest, and particu-<br/>larly the peace
                            makers and chiefs among yourselves,<br/> to make by-laws to prevent your
                            Nation from going<br/> so much among the white people, or bringing
                            Rum<br/> into your Nation, we may be discouraged from lend-<br/>ing you
                            assistance. Now, Brothers, we want you to<br/> be wise, study your own
                            good, and endeavour to<br/> promote your own happiness. We fully depend
                            on<br/> you to use exertions to make a reform in your Nation,<br/> and
                            that you will, in the first place, strive to leave<br/> off drinking
                                <emph rend="italic">Rum</emph>, as being the first and great
                            step<br/> to your becoming a sober and industrious, and, in<br/> time, a
                            civilized people; and hoping this happy<br/> change may take place, you
                            may likely again receive<br/> another visit next summer from some of our
                            Society;<br/> and in order to encourage you to go on in well-doing,<br/>
                            we have agreed to comply with your request in<br/> sending you a few
                            goods, in confidence that you will<br/> pay us punctually for them in
                            twelve months.</p>
<p>As we have endeavoured to point out the path<br/>which leads to your
                            happiness in this world and the<br/> next, so we hope you will be
                            favoured with strength<br/>and good resolutions to walk in it; and, as
                            you now<br/> experience a fresh instance of our regard, in
                            furnish-<br/>ing you with some goods, so we particularly request<br/> of
                            you to be very cautious how you suffer them to<br/> go out of your
                            possession. Only trust such of your <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_100" n="106"></pb>Nation as you know
                            are men of uprightness, who<br/> will pay you in good season, whereby
                            you will be<br/> enabled to be punctual in paying at the time
                            pro-<br/>posed, which will greatly add to the reputation of<br/> your
                            character as a people, and, in an especial man-<br/>ner, secure to you
                            the future favour and friendship<br/> of our Society; which, that it may

                        <opener><salute>BROTHERS,</salute></opener>
<p>In all my intercourse and acquaintance, I have<br/> endeavoured to give
                            you proofs that I am your friend.<br/> Of this truth I trust you are
                            well convinced. If, <br/>then, you believe me to be your friend, you
                            will listen<br/> to my talk; and if you think I have understanding<br/>
                            to discern what is for your best good, you will attend<br/> to my
                            advice.</p>
<p>Brothers—I have often shown you what good things<br/> the white people
                            enjoy, and explained how you might<br/> also enjoy them. You have
                            answered, that what I<br/> told you was very good, and that you were
                            willing <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_101" n="107"></pb>to adopt the useful ways of the white people
                            by <br/>degrees, but that you could not lay aside your old<br/> customs
                            all at once. This was a wise answer. It<br/> will be necessary for you
                            to continue your hunting<br/> while the game is so plenty as to be worth
                            pursuing.<br/> But you already know that the game is becoming<br/>
                            scarce, and have reason to expect, that in a few years<br/> more it will
                            be gone. What then will you do to feed<br/> and clothe yourselves, your
                            wives and children?<br/> Brothers, this is an important question; think
                            well<br/> upon it; the oldest hunters may, perhaps, find some<br/> game
                            as long as they live; but before the young men<br/> grow old, all the
                            game will be destroyed; the young<br/> men, then, and the boys, should
                            learn to get food and<br/> clothing without hunting. How are they to do
                            this?<br/> By cultivating the ground as the white people do;<br/> for
                            with what grows out of the ground they can<br/> purchase all other
                            necessaries. If you make fences<br/> to enclose many fields, you can
                            then securely raise<br/> corn, wheat, and hay in abundance, to feed
                            your<br/> families, and as many cattle and hogs as you want,<br/> and
                            the cattle and hogs will give you more meat than<br/> you could ever
                            obtain by hunting, even when game<br/> was plentiest.</p>
<p>Now, Brothers, I have the good pleasure to inform<br/> you, that your
                            good friends, the Quakers, have formed<br/> a wise plan to show your
                            young men and boys the<br/>most useful practices of the white people.
                            They will<br/> choose some prudent good men to instruct them.<br/> These
                            good men will do this only for the love they<br/> bear to you, their
                            fellow men, as children of the Great<br/> Spirit, whom they desire to
                            please, and who will be <br/>pleased with the good they do to you. The
                            Quakers<br/> and the good men they employ, will ask nothing<br/> from
                            you, neither land, nor money, nor skins, nor<br/> furs, for all the good
                            they will render unto you; they<br/> will only request your consent, and
                            the attention of<br/> the young men and boys to learn what will be
                            so<br/> useful.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_102" n="108"></pb>
<p>Brothers—If this first attempt succeeds, the way<br/> will be opened in
                            which your young people may<br/> learn other useful practices of the
                            white people, so<br/>as to enable them to supply all their own wants,
                            and<br/> such as choose it may learn to read and write.</p>
<p> Having thus explained to you the plan of your<br/> friends, the Quakers,
                            I conclude with heartily recom-<br/>mending it to your adoption, as
                            better calculated to<br/> procure lasting and essential benefits to your
                            Nations<br/> than any plan ever before attempted. Wishing it<br/> great
                            success, I remain your friend and brother,</p>

<p>The Society of Friends, always manifesting a<br/> desire to promote the
                            best interest of the Indians,<br/> have now formed a plan to introduce
                            among them<br/> the most necessary arts of civil life, and have
                            raised,<br/> and will raise, money, and employ agents, to carry<br/> it
                            into effect, or at least to make a fair experiment<br/> to change their
                            present habits, and to adopt in their<br/> places the practice of those
                            most necessary arts. In<br/> this attempt, the Friends will need the
                            assistance of<br/> all well disposed men, who are capable of
                            deriving<br/> pleasure from the happiness of their fellow men, and<br/>
                            are therefore willing to promote it. But, of all men,<br/> those who
                            understand the language of the Indians,<br/> if possessed of capacity
                            and humanity, have it in<br/> their power to do them most good; for this
                            reason,<br/> the Friends earnestly desire your aid; their great<br/>
                            object is, not to teach peculiar <emph rend="italic">doctrines</emph>,
                            but useful<br/>
<emph rend="italic">practices</emph>; to instruct the Indians in
                            husbandry, and<br/> the plain mechanical arts and manufactures directly
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_103" n="109"></pb> connected with it. This is beginning at the
                            right<br/> end, and, if so much can be accomplished, their far-<br/>ther
                            improvements will follow of course.</p>
<p>The agents whom the Friends mean to engage to<br/> reside among the
                            Indians, will be men divested of all<br/> mercenary views, and devoted
                            for the time solely to<br/> the pursuit of the object above
                            explained.</p>
<p>To the request of the Friends I add mine, that you<br/> will embrace
                            every occasion which shall offer to ex-<br/>plain to the Indians of the
                                <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a>, and to per-<br/>suade
                            them to adopt, a plan whose sole object is their<br/> happiness. I am,

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>The Society of Friends have formed a plan to<br/> instruct the Indians of
                            the <a href="/organizations/sxntns">Six Nations<orgname key="sxntns"></orgname></a> in husbandry<br/> and
                            the most necessary arts of civil life. The good-<br/>ness of the design,
                            and the disinterestedness of the<br/> motives, must recommend it to the
                            favour and support<br/> of all who wish the happiness of their fellow
                            men.<br/> You are of this number, and as the Indians have<br/>
                            confidence in you, it will be in your power greatly<br/> to promote the
                            success of the plan; and I am sure<br/> you will not need urging to
                            exert it, on all fit occa-<br/>sions. The persons who will be employed
                            by the<br/> Friends in this benevolent undertaking, will make<br/>
                            themselves known to you, and ask your advice and<br/> assistance. You
                            will oblige me by presenting my<br/> kind regard to your brother and
                            sister, and I beg you<br/> to be assured of my esteem and
                            friendship.</p>

                        An Account of the Commissioners of <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> who<br/> were appointed by Government to
                            explore the Back<br/> Country, &amp;c. in <date when="1796">1796</date>.<dateline><date when="1796"></date></dateline>
<p>On their arrival in the town in which the <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn-planter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> usually resides, they communicated to
                            him,<br/> and the men of the town, the errand on which they<br/> came.
                            After receiving a welcome, and an approba-<br/>tion of their business,
                            the Commissioners retired, and<br/> were about to proceed forward, when
                            they were<br/> again called to the Council House, where an elderly<br/>
                            Indian woman, in the presence of the <a href="/people/cornp2">Corn-planter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a><br/> and his Council, gave in charge to the
                            Commissioners<br/> to inform your Excellency,</p>
<p>That, in the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, the women
                            have as<br/> much to say in Council as the men have, and in all<br/>
                            important business have equal authority; that all<br/> affairs of trade
                            and agriculture are under the sole<br/>direction of the women; that
                            having learned from<br/>their Wise Men that the business they came on
                            was<br/>a search after a better road into their country than<br/>the
                            usual trading path, the women had judged it<br/> proper to express their
                            approbation of that measure,<br/> which they saw was equally
                            advantageous to the<br/><a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, by
                            lessening the expense of carriage, as to<br/> the white people; that
                            they were sensible that since<br/> the game was going from among them,
                            their men<br/>had been less successful in hunting than formerly,<br/>yet
                            they hoped their trade was well worth their<br/>attention; that the
                            proposals made last Spring by<br/>the Chiefs of their Nations, for
                            introducing the plough<br/>among them, had been considered and approved
                            by<br/>the women, who had the greatest interest in it, as<br/>the labour
                            fell wholly on them; that they had also<br/>approved of the request for
                            teachers to be sent among<br/>them to instruct their young people; that
                            if these<br/>were done, they hoped that their Nation might be-<br/>come
                            one people with the Americans, and the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/> would then enjoy the advantages which they

<p>We expect you have already been informed of<br/>the Governor having

                            recom-<br/>mend, from our knowledge of him, as your good<br/>friend. We
                            are satisfied he has the welfare of your<br/>Nation much at heart, and,
                            as we have given you<br/>many proofs of our steady friendship, we hope
                            you<br/>will now closely attend to such advice as <a href="/people/wfloy1">GeneralFloyd<persname key="wfloy1"></persname></a> may give you. He will kindly inquire
                            into<br/> your situation, and you must make known your<br/> wants to
                            him; he will advise you what by-laws and<br/>regulations may be
                            necessary for you to make among <br/>yourselves, and you will inform him
                            of such as you<br/> have already made, so that he may give you his
                            senti-<br/>ments thereon. Having had several conversations<br/>with him
                            on the subject of your affairs, we shall<br/> leave him to inform you of
                            the supplies that is pro-<br/>posed to be handed you this summer. You

                            is really began among you; we earnestly<br/>recommend to those sober men
                            and women who have<br/>so nobly stepped forward in so good an
                            undertaking,<br/>that they persevere in a steady conduct, and, by
                            set-<br/>ting examples of sobriety and industry, induce others<br/>to
                            join them, not only in refraining themselves from<br/>the least use of
                            spirituous liquors, but to put your<br/>laws in full force against all
                            offenders in this respect.<br/>Until this shameful practice is entirely
                            laid aside,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_106" n="112"></pb> you will labour under many great

<p>Before you cover your Council Fire, we beg your<br/>attention to the
                            voice of your brethren. The different<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_107" n="113"></pb>tribes living at
                                <a href="/places/oneida">Oneida<placename key="oneida"></placename></a> country, speaks to you in
                            re-<br/>membrance of the friendship you have manifested<br/>towards them
                            in all our treaties; we ourselves have<br/>held Councils at different
                            times, to contemplate the<br/>welfare of our nations, because we cannot
                            but groan<br/>to see our situation; it is also melancholic to
                            reflect<br/>on the ways of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Brothers—You, also, sometimes sorry to see the de-<br/>plorable situation
                            of your Indian Brethren, for which<br/>you have given us many good
                            counsels; though we<br/>feel willing to follow your counsels, but it has
                            made<br/>no effect as yet.</p>
<p>Our situation is still miserable. Our ancestors have<br/>been conquered,
                            immediately after you came on this<br/>Island, by the strong Heroe, who
                            does still reign<br/>among Indian tribes with tyranny, who has
                            robbed<br/>us of every thing that was precious in our eyes.<br/>We need
                            not mention every particular, how this<br/>tyrant has used us, for your
                            eyes have been open to<br/>behold our dismal situation.</p>
<p>By the power of our enemy our eyes have been<br/>blinded; our young men
                            became willing slaves to<br/>this despotic Heroe, so that we have
                            displeased the<br/>good Spirit, and we could not become
                            civilized<br/>people.</p>
<p>In looking back, we see nothing but desolation of<br/>our mighty men; in
                            looking forward, we foresee the<br/> desolation of our tribes. Our
                            Chiefs have used their<br/>endeavours to reform their respective people,
                            but,<br/>having seen no success, they seem discouraged, and<br/>hang
                            down their heads.</p>
<p>Brothers—In remembrance of your kind promises,<br/>we unite our cries to
                            you for help.</p>
<p>Perhaps, you are ready to think whatman it must<br/>be that have abused
                            so much of our brethren; never<br/>was such Heroe, or tyrant, heard that
                            ever meddled<br/>with Indians. But, in reality, he is your own
                            begot-<br/>ten son, and his name you call Rum, and the names<br/>of his
                            officers, are Brandy, Wine, and Gin, and we<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_108" n="114"></pb>know that
                            you have the power to control him ; and,<br/>as we desire to live in

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Thy favour of <date when="1796-10-19">19th ultimo</date>, to <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, is<br/> now before us, with the
                            contents of which we are<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_109" n="115"></pb>much pleased. The delay of the
                            buildings, and lay-<br/>ing out the money designed for that, in articles
                            more<br/> immediately necessary for the Indians, we think a<br/>very
                            judicious step, as, while it will tend to convince<br/>them how much we
                            wish to serve them, they will<br/>also receive more immediate benefits.
                            We hope, by<br/>this time, the goods proposed to be sent them
                            when<br/>thou wast here, have reached them. Thou wilt ob-<br/>serve
                            several additions to them, that were agreed to<br/> before thou left us,
                            which was in consequence of our<br/>interview with the Governor.</p>
<p>As the articles will, probably, be ready for distri-<br/>bution before
                            thou comest away, thou mayest proba-<br/>bly learn whether they are
                            suitably adapted to their<br/>wants, and from thence form a judgment how
                            to<br/> proceed in future. When suitable opportunity can be<br/>had to
                            consult with them, we think there would be<br/>a propriety in doing it.
                            And, therefore, as it is<br/>probable, some supplies of clothing,
                            blankets, &amp;c.,<br/>may be wanted for the winter season, it would
                            be<br/>agreeable to us if thou wouldest endeavour to obtain<br/>such
                            knowledge of the articles most necessary, and<br/>furnish us with the
                            list thereof. We also think there<br/> will be a propriety in making an
                            inquiry of them,<br/>what it is probable they will want next season, as
                            that<br/>will afford us time to procure the articles, both
                            in<br/>quantity and quality, much better adapted to their<br/> use, and,
                            perhaps, a saving. This spring, we found<br/>much difficulty in
                            procuring some things, particularly<br/>the hoes, axes, scythes,
                            &amp;c., some of which are short<br/>of the quantity designed, and, we
                            fear, may also be<br/> deficient in the quality, though we spared no
                            pains<br/>to procure them of the most proper kinds.</p>
<p>If thou shouldest have another opportunity with<br/> the Indians before
                            thy return, we wish to inform<br/>them of our uniting with thee in what
                            thou hast done;<br/>and we also unite in sentiment with thee, on
                            the<br/>absolute necessity of their making <q><emph rend="italic">strait
                                    by-laws</emph></q> to<br/>prevent the introduction of spirituous

                            careful strictly<br/>to enforce them in all delinquencies.</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Since our last, we have been without any of<br/>thy favours, and although
                            we much approved of what<br/>thou didst, as being for the most immediate
                            benefit<br/>of the Indians, and have paid the bills thou
                            drewest,<br/>yet we have since had cause to regret furnishing<br/>them
                            with any supplies, till their school house was<br/>built. We now find
                            that the law expressly directs,<br/>that the school house shall be first
                            built, and a mas-<br/>ter provided, and until this is done, the Governor
                            is<br/>restrained from handing us any more money than<br/>may be thought
                            sufficient for those purposes. Of<br/>course, when we called on him, in
                            expectation of<br/>receiving the money, we could get none, as he
                            said<br/>the house must be first completed, as the law directs.</p>
<p>We have now no way of being paid our advances,<br/>but by setting about
                            and completing the school house<br/>with all possible expedition ; and,
                            on consulting with<br/>the Governor, we have approved of erecting only
                            a<br/>school house at present, and, at a future time, erect<br/>another
                            house, to serve for to transact their town<br/>business in, and as a
                            meeting house. We have, there-<br/>fore, with his approbation, changed
                            the plan of that<br/>we sent thee, and, enclosed, thou wilt find one
                            calcu-<br/>lated for a school house only. Near where the old<br/>one
                            stands, on <emph rend="italic"><a href="/people/jtuhi1">John
                                    Tuhis<persname key="jtuhi1"></persname></a>'s land</emph>, is thought to be an<br/>eligible
                            spot for the new house.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if the Indians are informed that the Go-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_111" n="117"></pb>vernor
                            is restrained by law, from granting any farther<br/>support to them,
                            until the house is finished, they will<br/>generally turn out, and
                            endeavour by their exertions<br/> to complete the building in a short
                            time.</p>
<p>We are of opinion, that logs be collected, and sawed<br/>into pieces
                            about four or five inches thick, and as<br/>wide as the timber will
                            admit of, to be placed on the<br/>top of each other, and pinned and
                            dove-tailed toge-<br/>ther. The building then to be boarded on the
                            outside,<br/>with boards to stand upright, not lengthways.
                            These<br/>boards may be planed, so as they can be painted,
                            if<br/>thought necessary, at a future day. The roof to be<br/>shingled;
                            the lower pieces of the building to be pitch<br/>pine or white oak, to
                            prevent decay. The house<br/>should stand about eighteen inches above
                            the ground,<br/>underpinned with brick or stone, and till this can
                            be<br/>done, it may remain, perhaps, till next year, supported<br/>on
                            blocks. The floor should be pitch pine plank, or,<br/>if not to be had,
                            of white pine, and ceiled above<br/>with boards. The floor and ceiling
                            should be grooved,<br/>but need not to be planed.</p>
<p>On this plan we wish thee to procure as many men<br/>as can work, and to
                            proceed immediately, and erect<br/>a house in the most convenient
                            situation that can be<br/>obtained; and thou wilt readily see the
                            necessity of<br/>sending us an acoount of the cost thereof, as soon
                            as<br/>it can be ascertained, which, if some part is done by<br/>the
                            job, may be done even before the building is<br/>finished. Thou wilt
                            please engage young <a href="/people/ewamp1">Wampey<persname key="ewamp1"></persname></a>,<br/> or
                            some other, for a master, at a stipulated salary,<br/>until we can
                            procure one that may be better quali-<br/>fied.</p>
<p>The Governor agrees to advance us five hundred<br/>dollars towards
                            erecting the proposed house; but thou<br/>wilt remember, no more can be
                            got till the building<br/>is finished, or the cost thereof known, so as
                            to report<br/>it to the Governor. It will be also necessary,
                            that<br/>thou sendest us an account of articles purchased for,<br/> and
                            supplied to, the Indians.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_112" n="118"></pb>
<p>Thou mayest readily procure money for going on<br/>with the building,
                            from any of the store keepers, for<br/>bills on us, which we would be
                            glad thou couldest<br/>make at thirty days' sight, if in thy power. It
                            is<br/> probable thou mayest engage Post, at <a href="/places/ofsch">old

                            perfect, of all spoken by the Indian<br/>tribes. It is said to be so

<opener><salute>GRANDFATHER,</salute></opener>
<p>Attend to the words of your grand-children.</p>
<p>I am glad that, by the goodness of the great Good<br/>Spirit, we are
                            allowed to meet together by the side<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_113" n="119"></pb> of this
                            fire-place, and smoke the pipe of friendship,<br/>while we talk together
                            in commemoration of ancient<br/>covenant, which our forefathers
                            established, and es-<br/>teemed it.</p>
<p>I am glad that the Great Spirit puts it in your<br/>minds to visit your
                            grandchildren, and preserve you<br/>through the tedious journey, so to
                            arrive here safely.</p>
<p> Grandfather—When I look on you, I see your tears<br/>flowing down from
                            your eyes, on account of the dust<br/>that flew about on the way, as you
                            were coming<br/>from your fire-place hither.</p>
<p>In remembrance of the ancient customs of our<br/>ancestors, I now stretch
                            forth my hand, and wipe off<br/>your tears, that you may see your
                            grandchildren in<br/>real appearance; in like manner, I clean your
                            ears,<br/>that you may hear plainly the voice of your
                            grand-<br/>children, and also clean your throat, and loose
                            your<br/>tongue, that you may speak freely.</p>
<p>Grandfather—And also I find that your heart is<br/> hanging downwards, on
                            account of the many losses<br/>in your Nation these many days; and,
                            according to<br/>the customs of our forefathers, I now set your
                            heart<br/>upright, and lay aside all the sound which the white<br/>birds
                            have sounded on your ears, that you may, with-<br/>out prejudice, be
                            enabled to consider what your<br/>grandchildren may say to you.</p>
<p>Grandfather—Having done so much, then I see<br/>mud all over your legs
                            and feet, for an account of<br/>the long muddy path in which you have
                            walked<br/>through. I now wash your legs and feet, but still
                            I<br/>discover some briars and thorns sticking fast in your<br/>feet;
                            now I pull out every one of them, and I take<br/><emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="del">weesquos</foreign></emph>, in which our
                            ancestors used to put healing<br/>oil, and oint your feet and legs, that
                            you may feel<br/> well, and walk around by the fire-place of
                            your<br/>grandchildren.</p>
<p>(A string of pure white wampum delivered.)</p>
<p> Grandfather—Again listen.</p>
<p> I am glad to find that you still retain our talk, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_114" n="120"></pb>
                            which passed between us at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, when we<br/>saw each other there, (about
                            four years ago,) at which<br/>time I took hold on your hand, and
                            directed you to<br/>my fire-place, which invitations our Chiefs, with
                            our<br/> young men, do now renew.</p>
<p>I spread this <emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="del">unnukkcon</foreign></emph>, or mat, wide, on which I<br/>put
                            you; likewise those pillows to lay your heads<br/>on; then I stretch
                            forth my hand on your fire-place,<br/>and roll your mat, which you used
                            to sit on, and<br/>spread it over on the other mat, which I just
                            made<br/>ready for you, that you may feel more easy and
                            com-<br/>fortable; here you will eat with your grandchildren<br/>out of
                            one dish, and use one spoon; by the side of<br/> this fire-place you can
                            cook what you please, and at<br/>night you can lay down to rest, and
                            dream about the<br/>welfare of your men, women, and children. In
                            the<br/>morning you can get up, and promote the same.</p>
<p> Grandfather—Lastly, I let you know that I put a<br/>broom by the side of
                            this bed, so that, whenever you<br/>feel something hard on this bed,
                            then when shall<br/>use the broom to sweep off every thing, that
                            nothing<br/>may interrupt your rest.</p>
<p>(<foreign xml:lang="del">Nunnchtkchk</foreign>. String of wampum
                            delivered.)</p>
<p> Grandfather—once more attend.</p>
<p> We will now let you know the reasons which in-<br/>duce your
                            grandchildren to give you such invitations.</p>
<p> 1st. Because I believe that it is the will of the<br/>great Good Spirit,
                            that our ancestors did enter into<br/>covenant, and established a strong
                            friendship between<br/> them, which covenant we ever have
                            maintained<br/>bright.</p>
<p>2d. Because, by the goodness of the same Spirit,<br/>we obtained this
                            good dish, wherein we may eat<br/>peaceably; and, by his kind
                            providence, we were en-<br/>abled to see your dismal situation; and
                            farther, I<br/>believe, that it is the same good Spirit who
                            influenced<br/>our hearts to have the compassionate feelings
                            towards<br/>your Nation.</p>
<p>3d. Because I believe, that if you can only once<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_115" n="121"></pb> make
                            out to bring the whole of your Nation here,<br/> you can have better
                            chance to try to live as a people,<br/>because this dish is much better
                            than your old dish.</p>
<p>4th. Because you will have the privilege of hear-<br/>ing the glad
                            tidings of the Gospel preached, and your<br/>children will be instructed
                            to read and write.</p>
<p>5th. Because here we can live together as one<br/>family, and counsel one
                            another, and comfort<br/>and exhort one another daily, so long as we are
                            allowed<br/>to live this side of eternity.</p>

<p>I am glad that, by the goodness of the Great<br/>Spirit, we were allowed
                            to meet together by the side<br/>of this fire-place, to smoke the pipe
                            of friendship, as<br/>our ancestors were accustomed to do.
                            Grandchildren,<br/>I am glad to find a token of your friendship,
                            which<br/>you manifested at your grandfather's arrival at
                            this<br/>fire-place; likewise, ever since, for which we
                            are<br/>extremely thankful, and ever shall be gratefully
                            re-<br/>membered.</p>
<p>Grandchildren—At our arrival, you wiped away<br/>the tears from our eyes,
                            which were caused by the<br/>filth and dust which blew into them in our
                            long<br/>journey, as also, on the account of the many tall<br/>trees,
                            which are fallen and lost amongst us. Like-<br/>wise, you have cleared
                            out my ears and throat, and<br/>set my heart upright. Likewise, you have
                            wiped off <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_116" n="122"></pb>the mud from my legs and feet, and, finding
                            them<br/>full of briars and thorns, you reached thither your<br/>hands,
                            and plucked them all out, and applied the<br/>healing oil of our
                            deceased ancestors upon them.</p>
<p>Grandchildren—Since your performance of this<br/> kindness to your
                            grandfather, I see you clearly; I<br/>see the tears running down on your
                            eyes, on the<br/>account of the many losses in your Nation, and
                            the<br/>many high trees that are fallen.</p>
<p>Grandchildren—Now, in remembrance of our an-<br/>cient covenant, I
                            stretch forth my hands, and raise<br/>up your head, and obliterate from
                            your eyes and mind<br/>all tears and sorrow, and fix your eyes forward,
                            that<br/>they may not be obstructed from looking forward<br/>on the
                            happy days which are coming, in looking back<br/>on the trees which are
                            fallen.</p>
<p>Grandchildren—I also cleanse your ears, that you<br/>may hear plainly ;
                            and strengthen your tongues, that<br/>you may be enabled to speak the
                            things which are<br/>profitable for your Nation, both temporally and
                            spi-<br/>ritually. Likewise, I set your heart upright, that you<br/>may
                            be capable of contemplating the welfare and<br/>happiness of your old
                            men, women, and children.</p>
<p>Now, Grandchildren, attend.</p>
<p>By these strings you renew the kind invitation<br/>you gave us, when we
                            saw each other in <a href="/places/phila">Philadel-phia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.
                            I think it needless to repeat the same, but for<br/>which we again thank
                            you. Likewise, Grandchil-<br/>dren, be it known unto you, that we have
                            deeply<br/> considered your invitation, and finding it
                            heartily<br/>sincere, and your dish a lasting good one, and your<br/>
                            paths so good and straight, we accept of your invi-<br/>tation, and lay
                            hold on it with both of our hands,<br/>hoping that the great Good Spirit
                            may enable and<br/>protect us, in promoting each other's welfare
                            and<br/>happiness, and that we may live and die together by<br/> the
                            side of your fire-place.</p>
<p>Now, Grandchildren, I must tell you, now that I<br/>am about turning my
                            eyes towards my fire-place,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_117" n="123"></pb> hoping that, as you have
                            begun and entered in this<br/>good path, you may stiil continue to
                            persevere there-<br/>in ; and although we shall be absent some time
                            in<br/>body, our hearts shall still be present with you.</p>

<p>I am desirous that, in the early part of this op-<br/>portunity, you may
                            be informed that the people called<br/>Quakers, consider all mankind as

                            all mankind—that we<br/>should not do one another hurt, but that we
                            should<br/>do one another all the good we can; and it is on<br/>this
                            ground and this principle, that we believe it right<br/>to take you by
                            the hand.</p>

<p>After sitting a short time in silence, another Friend<br/>addressed them as
                    follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline>
<salute>BROTHERS AND FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>We, the people called Quakers, believe that it is<br/>required of us,
                            that we should all love one another,<br/>however separated we may be in
                            our local settlements<br/>in the world, or whatever difference there may
                            be in<br/>our colour. And, as we are convinced it is not in<br/>our
                            power to perform our religious duties to Him<br/>that hath created us,
                            without his assistance, so we<br/>conceive it to be our duty, when we
                            are about to<br/>enter upon such weighty business as, I apprehend, this
                            is,<br/>thus to sit down in stillness, in order to endeavour<br/>to feel
                            after the operation of his spirit in our hearts;<br/>and we believe that
                            this cannot be attained by our <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_119" n="125"></pb> own natural powers,
                            but must be under the influence<br/>of the Good Spirit.</p>
<p>We also believe that there is an evil spirit, which<br/>is always
                            striving to lead us into wrong things: that<br/> spirit which leads us
                            to hate and destroy one another;<br/>and in this persuasion of mind, we
                            believe it neces-<br/>sary for us to sit down in stillness and quiet, to
                            wait<br/>upon the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>Under these impressions, we are concerned often<br/>to assemble ourselves
                            together, that we may indivi-<br/>dually come under an exercise and
                            concern, to be<br/>rightly directed in our religious movements;
                            and<br/>once in the year we assemble at certain places, in<br/>order to
                            have a general and full conference, to know<br/> how things are amongst
                            us as a people.</p>
<p>One of these meetings is held at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and<br/>another at <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>At our <orgname key="bym">yearly meeting at <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a></orgname>, several years<br/>past, our
                            minds were brought under a concern on<br/>behalf of our brethren, the
                            Indians; and remember-<br/>ing the friendship that had subsisted between
                            our<br/>society and the Indians, from the first settlement of<br/>our
                            fathers upon this continent, and at the same time<br/>recollecting that
                            the country to the westward was<br/>fast settling, apprehensions arose
                            in our mind, that,<br/>as the game became scarce, they would be
                            brought<br/>under sufferings; and, as there had been long
                            wars<br/>between some of the white people and the Indians,<br/>we had
                            not had, for a long time, an opportunity of<br/>taking our brothers, the
                            Indians, by the hand.</p>
<p>Now, brothers, as we are thus led by the concerns<br/>that arose in our
                            council, some of us were appointed<br/>to go out into the wilderness,
                            and endeavour to get<br/>amongst our brethren, the Indians, that we
                            might<br/>have some talk with them; and amongst those who<br/> were
                            appointed, this, my brother, who sits at my<br/>right hand, was one; and
                            I have thought that he,<br/>perhaps, can give a more full account, both
                            of the<br/>times, and of our first movements at the concern. </p>

<salute>BROTHERS,</salute></opener>
<p> About six years ago, we believe, the Good Spirit<br/>put into our
                            hearts, at our great council, held in this<br/>town, to endeavour to do
                            something for the Indians;<br/>and, about four years ago, two others,
                            besides myself,<br/>went over the Great Mountains, westward, in
                            order<br/>to see your situation, and to know your
                            disposition,<br/>whether you would receive any thing from us or not.</p>
<p>We wished to go to <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>, expecting
                            to find<br/>the greatest number of Indians at that place. We<br/>could
                            not get a guide till we got to the forks of <geogname key="sciot">Scioto</geogname>,<br/>where we agreed with one to take us to
                                <a href="/people/izane1">Isaac Zane's<persname key="izane1"></persname></a>. At that place,
                            we were informed that a<br/>number of chiefs were at <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>We sent for some <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> chiefs, who
                            resided<br/> about 25 miles from <a href="/people/izane1">Isaac
                                Zane<persname key="izane1"></persname></a>'s, and had a confer-<br/>ence with them. We informed
                            them of the desire<br/>our society had, to do something for the Indians
                            that<br/> would be useful to them. From thence we went to<br/><a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>. <a href="/people/izane1">Isaac
                                Zane<persname key="izane1"></persname></a> piloted us, and there,<br/> also, we had a
                            conference with some of the <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a><br/> chiefs. We wanted to know whether they
                            would<br/>be willing to be instructed, on their own lands, in<br/>a way
                            to procure a sufficiency for them to eat; to<br/> have a mill to grind
                            their corn, and have their chil-<br/>dren instructed to read and write?
                            They informed<br/>us, that they could not give us an answer at that
                            time,<br/>but would lay our proposals before their council.</p>
<p>About three years ago, we received a speech and<br/>a belt of wampum from
                            a council held at <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>;<br/>the
                            speech did not contain an answer to the propo-<br/>sals made to them,
                            but an invitation to us to attend<br/>their council. (A short
                            pause.)</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, chief of the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miamis<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, said:—</p>
<p><said who="lturt1">BROTHER,<br/> It is not usual for us to interrupt any one
                    in<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_121" n="127"></pb>speaking, but I wish to inquire, from whom the<br/>
                        speech you mention came?</said></p>
<p>(The speech was then produced, and the names to<br/>it read)—<a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> added—</p>
<p><said who="lturt1">I see that our brothers, the Quakers, are not so<br/>fully
                        acquainted with the situation of the Indians as<br/>we wish. After we have
                        taken the great chief of<br/>the white people by the hand, I hope he will
                        give<br/>you full information with respect to us.</said></p>
<p>The Friend, who had been interrupted, then pro-<br/>ceeded:—</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><salute>BROTHERS,</salute><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline></opener>
<p>Two years, last Spring, seven of us went over<br/> the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, and thence to <a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>, at the time<br/>mentioned in the speech
                            that was sent to us—we<br/>were invited to be there about the <date when="1799-06-01">first of June</date>, and,<br/>accordingly, got
                            there about that time, but were in-<br/>formed, that the council was not
                            to be held till<br/>about two weeks after. Not being accustomed
                            to<br/>their mode of living, and finding a considerable num-<br/>ber of
                            the Indians, at that place, intoxicated with<br/>liquor, we were much
                            discouraged, and concluded<br/>we might as well return home again. The
                            Indians,<br/>however, notwithstanding their situation, treated
                            us<br/>very kindly. We got together several Chiefs of the<br/><a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and communicated to them our
                            business.<br/> They informed us, they would lay it before
                            the<br/>Chiefs, at the council, and return us answer; but we<br/>have
                            not received one.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>The Friend, who made the second communication,<br/> addressed them again, as
                    follows:—</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline>
<salute>BROTHERS AND FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>We were glad when we heard, that some of our<br/>red brethren were come
                            to this city, and felt our<br/>minds drawn to take them by the hand, in
                            order that<br/>we might have an opportunity of knowing them.</p>
<p> As we had not been acquainted with their situa-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_122" n="128"></pb>tions
                            and circumstances, we have not been able to<br/> judge, whether any
                            thing we had to propose to do<br/> for them, would be accepted?—Whether
                            they were<br/> under the necessity of applying to some other mode<br/>
                            for a livelihood ?—Whether the game in their coun-<br/>try was in
                            plenty?—We have thought, brothers, that<br/>if it should not yet be the
                            case, that the game is<br/> scarce, it probably will be the case at some
                            time;<br/>and, therefore, we thought it would be best for our<br/>red
                            brethren, to give some attention to the cultiva-<br/>tion of the
                            soil.</p>
<p>This is one of the subjects which has claimed our<br/>consideration. And,
                            feeling in our hearts, that we<br/>loved the Indians, and wished their
                            welfare, it was<br/>our concern that they might be instructed to
                            turn<br/>their attention to the cultivation of their lands. And,<br/>as
                            we believe, brothers, that we derive very great<br/>advantages from
                            reading books, which contain much<br/>instruction, and wishing our
                            brethren, the Indians,<br/>should also derive the same advantage with
                            us, we<br/>have wished that they should candidly let us
                            know,<br/>whether they desire these things, that we might do<br/>for
                            them whatever is in our power to do.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>After a pause, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> observed:—</p>

<p>My heart returns thanks to the Great Spirit<br/>above, that has put it in
                            our power to speak to one<br/>another. My brother chiefs, with myself,
                            are glad<br/> that our friends and brothers, the Quakers, have
                            such<br/>great compassion for their red brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—Your red brethren believe, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_123" n="129"></pb>that
                            one man—one Great Man, made all the men that<br/> are on the earth; and
                            that he made the sun, the<br/>moon, and the stars, to give light, and to
                            be useful<br/>to them.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—We now rejoice, that the<br/>Great Spirit has made
                            you feel, that we stand in<br/>need of the assistance which you have
                            been descri-<br/>bing to us, and to wish, if possible, to render your
                            red<br/>brethren those services which they now are highly<br/>in need
                            of.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—It appears to us, your red<br/> brethren, that you
                            have been kept in the straight<br/> path, by the Great and Good Spirit.
                            We have been <br/>led astray by inferior spirits; we now hope,
                            that<br/>we may come upon your track, and follow it.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—The long and destructive<br/>wars that have raged in
                            the country of your red<br/>brethren, since your fathers first came
                            among them,<br/>have caused their numbers to be greatly
                            diminished.<br/>Those that have come amongst us, have very
                            much<br/>cheated and imposed upon us. They have found<br/>us simple and
                            ignorant, and have taken very great<br/>care to keep every thing from
                            our knowledge, in order<br/>to profit by our ignorance.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—We find that you are now<br/>disposed, with open
                            arms, to receive us, and we hope<br/>the Great Spirit will assist you,
                            together with the<br/> great chief of the white people, whom we are
                            now<br/>about to apply to for help.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—At the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>,<br/> which is now a little past six years
                            ago, we received<br/>some presents, by the hands of the great war chief
                            of<br/> the Americans, (<a href="/people/gwayn1">General
                            Wayne<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a>,) said to be sent to us<br/>by our brothers, the
                            Quakers. After this treaty, I<br/>was invited, by the great chiefs of
                            the Americans,<br/> to visit them. It is now four years since I
                            visited<br/>them, at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>,
                            whilst the great council was<br/>held at that city. I had there
                            opportunity to see our<br/>brothers, the Quakers, and received from
                            their mouths<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_124" n="130"></pb>some talks: all these talks I wrapped up
                            in my heart,<br/>and, when I returned home to my brothers, I
                            com-<br/>municated to them, faithfully, all those good things<br/>which
                            you had told us you were desirous to do for us.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—I am happy to say, that<br/> these, my red brothers,
                            now present with me, are<br/>chiefs, who, in their own country, are
                            equally great<br/>with myself. They were rejoiced to hear
                            your<br/>words, delivered to them, through me, four years ago,<br/>and
                            they are now equally glad with myself, to hear<br/>from the mouths of
                            our brothers, the Quakers, the<br/>same good words again.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—If we understand you right,<br/>you wish to add
                            comfort to our women and children,<br/> by teaching us some of your ways
                            of living. I am<br/>glad that the Great Spirit has put this into
                            your<br/>hearts, and am sorry that your exertions have not<br/>yet been
                            successful.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—I now assure you, that you<br/>hear the voice of the
                                <a href="/organizations/potaw">Patawattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/piank">Pisinkashaw<orgname key="piank"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/kicka">Kickapoo<orgname key="kicka"></orgname></a>,<br/> and <a href="/organizations/kaska">Kaskaskias<orgname key="kaska"></orgname></a> tribes of Indians, and that, if you<br/>wish
                            to do any thing for any of these nations of<br/>Indians, they will be
                            ready, at all times, to receive<br/>you—and we, also, will be ready, at
                            all times, to ren-<br/>der you any assistance in our power.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—This is the first time that<br/>the Great Spirit has
                            brought us to take our brethren,<br/>the <orgname key="bym">Quakers of
                                    <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a></orgname>, by the
                            hand, and we re-<br/>joice to hear them mention the same things to
                            us,<br/> that have heretofore been mentioned to us, by our<br/>
                            brothers, the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>.</p>
<p>Brothers—I, some time past, received from our<br/> brothers, the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>, some tools,<br/> amongst which
                            were two ploughs. I used them, and<br/>did all I could to keep them from
                            wearing out. I was<br/>pleased with them: they have now become
                            necessary<br/>to be repaired. We have nobody amongst us that<br/>can
                            mend them, and they are now useless to me. </p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_125" n="131"></pb>
<p> Brothers and Friends—It is now five days since<br/>we took our brothers,
                            the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>,<br/>by the hand—we then
                            talked over these things to-<br/>gether. They have promised me, that at
                            their next<br/>great council, they will hold a talk about these
                            things,<br/>and consider what they can do for us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—If our brothers, the <a href="/organizations/bym">Quakersof <orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>, desire to do any thing for the
                            Indians, I<br/>wish to give them full information of the place
                            where<br/>we may be found generally together. The great<br/>council of
                            our tribes of Indians, is held at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,<br/>at the time we receive our annuity from the
                            United<br/>States. At that time, any communications our
                            brothers<br/>wish to make to their red brethren, will be
                            safely<br/>handed to us by your white brother, our interpreter,<br/>now
                            with us, who is our agent at that place. (He<br/>then sat down, but,
                            after a short pause arose again.)</p>
<p>Brothers—I must add a few words farther: I find<br/>that I have not fully
                            answered all the questions that<br/>our brothers have put to us.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—It is the real wish of your<br/>brothers, the
                            Indians, to engage in the cultivation of<br/>our lands. And although the
                            game is not yet so<br/>scarce, but that we can get enough to eat, we
                            know<br/>it is becoming scarce, and that we must begin to<br/>take hold
                            of such tools as we see are in the hands of<br/>the white people.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—We are now on our way to<br/>see the great chiefs of
                            the Americans at their council.<br/>We are glad to find that they
                            remember their red<br/>brethren, and rejoice to believe that the Great
                            Spirit<br/>has put it into the heart of the great chief of the<br/>white
                            people to do us such services as will add to the<br/>comfort of his red
                            children.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—I will now only add, that<br/>I rejoice to believe,
                            that your friendship to your red<br/>brethren is a friendship that is
                            pure—a friendship<br/>that comes from the heart—you want no
                            compensa-<br/>tion from the Indians for your services to them. You
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_126" n="132"></pb>do not want to take away our lands from
                            us—you<br/>have always made use of this language to us; and<br/>it has
                            always been with pleasure that I have com-<br/>municated it to our
                            brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers—We are a jealously disposed people—al-<br/>most every white man
                            that comes amongst us, endea-<br/>vours all he can to cheat us; this has
                            occasioned jea-<br/>lousy among us. But your talks, brothers, are
                            different;<br/>we believe you, when you say you want no
                            compensa-<br/>tion from us, for your services to your red brethren.</p>

<opener><salute>FRIENDS AND BROTHERS,</salute><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline></opener>
<p>I rejoice to hear that you have so much compas-<br/>sion on your red
                            brethren. As my friend the <a href="/people/lturt1">LittleTurtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> has observed, it is not the first time
                            that we<br/>have received tokens of friendship from you.</p>
<p>It is some years since the treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>,<br/> where we first experienced the
                            friendship of our<br/>brothers, the Quakers. He was there informed
                            of<br/>their good wishes, and of the great friendship they<br/>had for
                            their red brethren.</p>
<p>He returned home, and informed us of all the great<br/>talks he had with
                            our brothers, the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of<br/><a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>.</p>
<p>It is truly pleasing to me, brothers, to hear the<br/>same talks my
                            friend had informed me of, now<br/> repeated, on my arrival at
                                <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a>, by our friends<br/>and
                            brothers the Quakers.</p>
<p>I hope, brothers, that the Great Spirit, who has the<br/>disposal of men,
                            will assist you in your laudable<br/>undertakings, and enable you to be
                            of service to your<br/>red brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—The talks that you have<br/>now delivered to us,
                            shall be carefully collected,<br/>wrapped up, and put in our hearts—we
                            will not<br/>forget them. On our return home, we will have<br/>them
                            communicated from the head to the mouth of<br/>the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>—from this to the <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>, and up that<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_127" n="133"></pb>river till it
                            strikes the lakes, thence round by <a href="/places/michi">Michili-mackanack<placename key="michi"></placename></a>, until they come back again to
                            the same<br/>place.</p>
<p>What we say to you, you may he assured does not<br/>come from one man, it
                            comes from many—and what<br/>you have now said to us, you speak it to
                            but a few,<br/>but it shall be communicated to many.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—I observed to our friends the<br/><orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>, five days ago, what I
                            now<br/>say to you: That we wish our brothers, the Quakers,<br/>to
                            render us those services which they have proposed.<br/>We promise that
                            nothing shall be wanting on our<br/>part, to give aid to so desirable a
                            thing in our country.</p>
<p>Our situation, at present, will not admit of carrying<br/>such a plan so
                            fully into execution as might be<br/>desired by our brothers; but that,
                            I hope, will not<br/>prevent you from making trial. If we had such<br/>
                            tools as you make use of, and which add so much to<br/>your comfort—for
                            we have been lost in wonder at<br/>what we have seen amongst you—if we
                            had these<br/>instruments, we should, I hope, be willing to
                            use<br/>them; and in the course of a little time, there would<br/>be
                            people amongst us, that would know well how<br/>to use them, through the
                            assistance they might<br/>obtain from you, and the rest of our white
                            friends.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—Whatever goods you may<br/>have in store for your
                            red brothers, we cannot but<br/>wish that you will show them to us as
                            soon as pos-<br/>sible.</p>
<p>That we can yet live upon the game of our country<br/>is true; but we
                            know that this will not be the case<br/>long. Brothers, from the great
                            things, and the aston-<br/>ishing wonders which we have seen among you,
                            and<br/>finding they all come out of the earth, it makes me<br/>anxious
                            to try if I cannot get some for myself. I<br/> hope, brothers, that by
                            the aid of the Great Spirit,<br/>and of our friends and brothers, the
                            Quakers, together<br/>with the government of the United States, that
                            we<br/>shall yet be enabled to get these good things for our-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_128" n="134"></pb>selves—such as will make us, our women, and
                            our<br/>children happy.</p>
<p>Brothers—We do not know what our brothers, the<br/><orgname key="pym">Quakers of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>, may have in
                            contemplation<br/>to do for their red brethren, but we hope it will
                            be<br/>something that will add to our comfort; we hope<br/>it will be
                            something by which we shall profit; some-<br/>thing by which we shall be
                            enabled to cultivate our<br/>lands, and live by the fruits of the earth.
                            We have<br/>been walking in a thorny path; we want to get into<br/>your
                            track and follow it; and the sooner this is<br/>put into our power, I am
                            convinced the better it will<br/>be for our red brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—I have not much to say<br/>further; what has now
                            been said to you is the voice<br/>of the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pattawattamy<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>,
                                <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>,<br/><a href="/organizations/wee">Weas<orgname key="wee"></orgname></a>,

                                <a href="/organizations/kaska">Kaskas-kias<orgname key="kaska"></orgname></a> tribes of Indians. I
                            rejoice, brothers, that we<br/>now know each other, and hope if you have
                            any<br/>thing to communicate to your red brethren, that it<br/>will come
                            to us through your good brother, <a href="/people/wwell1">WilliamWells<persname key="wwell1"></persname></a>, our interpreter, who resides in our
                            country.<br/>We can place great confidence in him. He is the
                            only<br/>white man in our country we will trust; we shall<br/>then get
                            it, and do now assure you, that it shall be<br/>faithfully sent to all
                            these people, in the manner you<br/>wish it to be.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—I hope the Great Spirit will<br/> assist you in your
                            undertakings to do your red<br/>brethren good. Your movements towards
                            the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyan-dots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, have not met with
                            that success which they<br/>deserved. It makes me sorry to find an
                            answer from<br/>them of the kind you have mentioned. There is
                            a<br/>great deal, brothers, in having a good interpreter,<br/>and
                            beginning at the right end of the business.</p>

                Second Conference.
                <p>One of the Society of Friends opened the conference<br/> as follows:—</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline>
<salute>BROTHERS AND FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>When the talks, which we had last evening at<br/> this place, ended, I
                            believe it was generally under-<br/>stood, that the subject matter which
                            had been<br/>spoken upon, was satisfactory; but, on considering
                            fur-<br/>ther, some of us thought that there were some things<br/>of
                            considerable importance, which had not been<br/>spoken upon—and thought
                            that it would be right<br/>to have another opportunity.</p>
<p>We are, accordingly, again assembled—and, see-<br/>ing that it has been
                            the will of the Great Spirit, and<br/>Father of us all, to permit us
                            thus to come together<br/>again, it is my desire that any thing we may
                            feel<br/>in our hearts, that may be likely to have a tendency<br/>to
                            promote the good of our red brethren, may be freely<br/>spoken.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>Another Friend next addressed them, as follows:— </p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<opener><dateline><date when="1801"></date></dateline></opener>
<p>I may tell you, I have been made glad, that I have<br/>an opportunity of
                            sitting once more with you; and<br/>as I have found, that the more I am
                            with you, the<br/>more the love I have felt for you has increased,
                            and<br/>the stronger has been my desire for your welfare,<br/>and that
                            this love has taken away all fear of giving<br/>offence; I feel myself
                            authorized, I think, as a bro<br/>ther, to use freedom of speech with
                            you, and in the<br/> freedom which I feel, under the influence of
                            that<br/>love which, I trust, has been impressed upon my<br/>heart by
                            the Great and Good Spirit, who, as he has<br/>made us all of one blood,
                            so he requires of us, that<br/>we should love one another. I may tell
                            you, brothers,<br/>that, when I was in the Indian country, I had
                            fre-<br/>quent opportunities of observing the pernicious
                            con-<br/>sequences of the use of spirituous liquors, with which <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_130" n="136"></pb>the Indians were furnished by the traders; and as I<br/>
                            have reason to believe, that you who are now present<br/>are wise men,
                            who have eyes in your heads, and are<br/>able to see things as they
                            really are, I have felt a<br/>desire in my heart to know your opinions,
                            and what<br/>is your judgment concerning this thing—the
                            using<br/>spirituous liquors to excess; believing, brothers, that<br/>if
                            you have seen things in the same light in which I<br/>have seen them,
                            that you would be desirous that a<br/>stop might be put to the evils,
                            that arise from the use<br/>of so destructive a liquor. I may tell you,
                            brothers,<br/>who are now present, as well as the Indians in<br/>
                            general, that I have believed that there is not any<br/>thing that
                            stands more in your way to improvement<br/>than this, the too frequent
                            use of spirituous liquors:<br/>and I have thought, that if you are of
                            the same mind<br/> with us, who are your friends, and have your
                            good<br/>at heart, that it would be right for us to take the<br/>subject
                            into our serious consideration, to endeavour<br/>to discover, whether
                            there may not be some step<br/>taken, that would put a check upon this
                            pernicious<br/>thing.</p>
<p>Now, brothers, as a hint of this sort was omitted<br/>when we were
                            together last evening, some of us did<br/>not find our minds easy: we
                            thought it ought to<br/> have come under consideration, hoping that you,
                            who,<br/>as I have already said, have eyes in your heads, and<br/>can
                            see for yourselves, have had this subject under<br/>your consideration.
                            We now hope, brothers, that<br/>you will express yourselves freely to us
                            on this sub-<br/>ject, and let us know how it has happened to
                            you.<br/>After which, perhaps, it will open a way for some<br/> further
                            observations from us.</p>

<p>After a short pause, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, on his
                    seat,<br/> said, <said who="lturt1">I will now make some reply, if none of
                        my<br/>brothers have one to offer.</said></p>
<p>He was desired to proceed—when, rising on his<br/>feet, he said,</p>

<salute>MY BROTHERS AND FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>I am happy to find, that it has pleased the Great<br/>Spirit, that we
                            should again, this evening, meet in<br/>the same house, in which we held
                            our council yester-<br/>day. I am happy to find, that it is the will of
                            the<br/>Great and Good Spirit, that we should discover, there<br/>was
                            something yesterday not mentioned, that was<br/>highly necessary for the
                            welfare of your brethren.</p>
<p>Friends and Brothers—I am glad to find that it has<br/>pleased the Great
                            Spirit, to put a wish in your hearts,<br/>to know our opinions on the
                            subject you have men-<br/>tioned ; a subject of the greatest moment to
                            us.<br/>What you have said, relative to our being one flesh,<br/>and one
                            blood, is true. Your brothers, the Indians,<br/>believe, that it is in
                            this light the Great Spirit con-<br/>siders all mankind.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—My brother chiefs, that are<br/>now present, with
                            myself, are happy to find, that you<br/>have a good opinion of us. You
                            say, that you ap-<br/>prehend we have eyes in our heads, and can
                            clearly<br/>see for ourselves, those things that are injurious to
                            us.<br/>This, my friends and brothers, is the case; we clearly<br/>see
                            these things: my brother chiefs, that are now<br/> present with me, as
                            well as myself, have long seen<br/>them; we have long lamented these
                            great evils that<br/>have raged in our country, and that have done
                            your<br/>red brethren so much harm; we have applied for<br/>redress, and
                            endeavoured to have them removed from<br/>amongst us.</p>
<p>When our forefathers met first on this Island, your<br/>red brethren then
                            were numerous; but since the<br/>introduction amongst us of what you
                            call spirituous<br/>liquors, and what, we think, may be justly
                            called<br/>poison, our numbers are greatly diminished: it
                            has<br/>destroyed a great part of our red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad to hear you<br/>observe, that freedom
                            of speech ought always to be<br/>made use of amongst brothers; this,
                            brothers, really<br/>ought to be the case. I will now, therefore,
                            take<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_132" n="138"></pb>the liberty to mention, that most of the
                            existing<br/>evils amongst your red brethren, have been caught<br/>from
                            the white people; not only that liquor that<br/>destroys us daily, but
                            many diseases that our fore-<br/>fathers were ignorant of, before they
                            saw you.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad, with my<br/>brother chiefs, that are
                            now present, to find that you<br/>are ready to assist us in every thing
                            that will add to<br/>our good: we hope that the Great Spirit will aid
                            you<br/>in all your good undertakings, with respect to us.<br/>We
                            plainly perceive, brothers, that you see that very<br/>evil that
                            destroys your red brethren. It is not an<br/> evil, brothers, of our own
                            making; we have not<br/>placed it amongst ourselves; it is an evil
                            placed<br/>amongst us by the white people; we look up to them<br/>to
                            remove it out of our country: if they have that<br/>friendship for us,
                            which they tell us they have, they<br/>certainly will not let it
                            continue amongst us any<br/>longer. Our repeated entreaties to those who
                            bring<br/>this evil amongst us, we find, has not the desired<br/>effect.
                            We tell them—Brothers, fetch us useful things;<br/>bring goods that will
                            clothe us, our women, and our<br/>children, and not this evil liquor,
                            that destroys our<br/> reason—that destroys our health—that destroys
                            our<br/>lives: but all we can say on the subject is of no ser-<br/>vice,
                            nor gives relief to your red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad that you<br/>have seen into this
                            business as we do—I rejoice to<br/>find that you agree in opinion with
                            us, and express<br/>an anxiety to be, if possible, of service to us, to
                            remove<br/>this great evil out of our country—an evil that has<br/>had
                            so much room in it—that has destroyed so many<br/>of our lives, that it
                            causes our young men to say, <said who="undetermined">we<br/>had better
                                be at war with the white people: this<br/>liquor that they introduce
                                into our country is more<br/>to be feared than the gun and the
                                tomahawk; there<br/>are more of us dead since the treaty of
                                    <a href="/places/greenv">Grenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>,<br/>than we lost
                                by the six years war before; it is all<br/>owing to the introduction
                                of this liquor amongst us.</said><br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_133" n="139"></pb> Brothers, how to remove this evil from our country<br/>we
                            do not know; if we had known it to be a proper<br/>subject to have
                            mentioned to you in our council<br/>yesterday, we should surely have
                            done it. This<br/> subject, brothers, composes a part of what we
                            intend<br/>to make known to the great council of our white<br/>brethren.
                            On our arrival there we shall endeavour<br/>to explain to our great
                            father, the President; a great<br/>many evils that have arisen in our
                            country, from the<br/>introduction of this liquor by the white
                            traders.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—In addition to what I have<br/>before observed of
                            this great evil in the country of<br/>your red brethren, I will say
                            further, that it has<br/>made us poor. It is this liquor that causes our
                            young<br/>men to go without clothes, our women and children<br/>to go
                            without any thing to eat; and sorry am I to<br/>mention now to you,
                            brothers, that the evil is increas-<br/>ing every day, as the white
                            settlers come nearer to<br/>us, and bring those kettles they boil that
                            stuff in<br/>they call whiskey, of which our young men are
                            so<br/>extremely fond. Brothers, when our young men<br/>have been out
                            hunting, and are returning home load-<br/>ed with skins and furs, on
                            their way, if it happens<br/>that they come along where some of this
                            whiskey<br/>is deposited, the white man who sells it, tells them<br/>to
                            take a little drink; some of them will say no, I<br/> don't want it—they
                            go on till they come to another<br/>house, where they find more of this
                            same kind of<br/>drink; it is there again offered; they refuse; and
                            again<br/>the third time; but finally the fourth or fifth time<br/> one
                            accepts of it, and takes a drink, and getting<br/>one he wants another,
                            and then a third and a fourth,<br/>till his senses have left him. After
                            his reason comes<br/>back again to him, when he gets up and finds
                            where<br/>he is, he asks for his peltry: the answer is, you
                            have<br/>drank them. Where is my gun? It is gone. Where<br/>is my
                            blanket? It is gone. Where is my shirt? You<br/> have sold it for
                            whiskey!! Now, brothers, figure to<br/>yourselves what a condition this
                            man must be in; he <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_134" n="140"></pb>has a family at home, a wife and
                            children that stand<br/>in need of the profits of his hunting: what
                            must<br/>their wants be, when he himself is even without a<br/>
                            shirt?</p>
<p>This, brothers, I can assure you, is a fact that<br/>often happens among
                            us. As I have before observed,<br/>we have no means to prevent it. If
                            you, brothers,<br/>have it in your power to render us any
                            assistance,<br/>we hope the Great Spirit will aid you. We shall
                            lay<br/>these evils before our great and good father; we hope<br/>he
                            will remove them from amongst us; we shall<br/>assure him that if he
                            does not, there will not be<br/>many of his red children living long in
                            our country.<br/>The Great Spirit, brothers, has made you see as
                            we<br/>see; we hope, brothers, and expect, that if you have<br/> any
                            influence with the great council of the United<br/>States, that you will
                            make use of it in behalf of your<br/>red brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—The talks that you<br/>delivered to us when we
                            were in council yesterday,<br/>were certainly highly pleasing to myself,
                            as well as<br/>to my brother chiefs; we rejoiced to hear you
                            speak<br/>such words to us; but we all plainly saw, that there<br/>was a
                            great difficulty in the way, that ought to be<br/>removed, before your
                            good intentions towards us,<br/>could be carried into effect: we agree
                            with you,<br/>brothers, that this great evil amongst us,
                            spirituous<br/>liquors, must first be removed; after this is done,
                            we<br/>hope you will find an easy access to us, much easier<br/>than you
                            can have at present.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—I hope that if we all<br/>try to prevent the
                            introduction of spirituous liquors<br/>in the country of your red
                            brethren, that the Great<br/>Spirit will aid us in it, and that we shall
                            meet with<br/>no difficulty in doing it; after this is done, we
                            hope<br/>that the great services you have designed to do for<br/>us, the
                            great things mentioned by you in our<br/>council yesterday, may take
                            place, and have that<br/> success you so much desire.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_135" n="141"></pb>
<p>My Brothers and Friends—You have asked us our<br/>opinion, on the subject
                            of the introduction of<br/>spirituous liquors into our country. I have
                            now<br/>given it to you. If I have given it to you in such<br/>a manner
                            that you do not understand me, I would<br/>wish you to say so; all that
                            I have said to you, I<br/>wish to be made known to every body.</p>
<p>We have our enemies in our own country, as all<br/>other persons have in
                            theirs; it is no unusual thing,<br/> brothers, to hear some people among
                            us, (you will<br/>perceive, brothers, that these are people that
                            are<br/>interested in keeping us ignorant,) when they hear<br/>talks
                            that have been delivered by our chiefs, to<br/>people that are capable
                            of rendering us services, they<br/>say to our people, <said who="undetermined">do you not hear? your chiefs<br/>have sold
                                you—your chiefs have sold your lands.</said><br/>They put bad
                            stories in the mouths of our young<br/>men. For this reason, brothers,
                            all that I have said I<br/>wish to be made public; I wish every body to
                            know<br/>it. I only mention this to you, brothers. If it

<salute>MY BROTHERS AND FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>I have nothing to say on the subject we have<br/>now been talking over.
                            My friend, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>,<br/>has
                            given you a full answer to those things you have<br/>mentioned to us; we
                            are but one people, and have<br/>but one voice.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends—We have never had it in our<br/>power to hold such
                            talks with you at this place<br/> before. We have frequently had talks
                            of this kind<br/>with our brothers, the <orgname key="pym">Quakers of
                                    <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>;
                            they<br/>always appeared very glad to see us, and we find<br/>you the
                            same. We hope, brothers, that your friend-<br/>ship and ours will never
                            be broken. </p>

<p>What you have communicated to us at this time<br/>has been clearly

<p>We take this opportunity to inform you, that we<br/>have been happy to

                            we believe they are the children of light, and the<br/>words they spoke
                            flow from love.</p>
<p>Sisters—We will also inform you, that we, and a<br/>number of our Sisters
                            of this nation, have, this seve-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_138" n="144"></pb>ral years past, been

<p>Sisters—We find that these friends, who gave us<br/>many good counsels,

                            people, Squaws,) we are rejoiced to find<br/>that the 1 riends have such
                            love, which makes no<br/>distinction.</p>
<p>Sisters—We have religious meetings twice in<br/>every week, to seek after
                            the ways of the <emph rend="italic">Good Spirit</emph>,<br/>and have, at

<p>Although we never have seen any of you, yet let<br/>us join hand in hand
                            to serve the Lord Almighty,<br/>who is able to put such weapons on our

                            and<br/>that we may be able to hold out to the end, where<br/>we shall
                            join, to praise our Saviour to all eternity.<br/> Farewell.</p>

<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> made the subject of imprisonment
                    for<br/> debt, one of deep reflection. He did not believe that<br/> a man could,
                    by any contract, pledge his liberty par-<br/>tially; and it is conceded on all
                    sides, that no man<br/>can make himself a slave, liberty being an
                    unalien-<br/>able right. He saw that the gaols were crowded<br/> with poor
                    debtors, sent to those awful places for<br/>small sums, in general, where their
                    health and morals<br/>were injured, and their spirits broken down. The<br/>
                    philanthropist alone, whose feelings are enlisted in<br/>the spirit of reform,
                    can come to any just calculation<br/>of the number who, in former times,
                    suffered as poor<br/>debtors. He knew that more than ten thousand<br/>were
                    incarcerated in his own State, every year, for<br/>sums that would not average
                    fifteen dollars each;<br/>and he had sufficient information from many
                    other<br/>States, to discover, that the evil existed among them<br/>generally to
                    as great an extent, according to their<br/> population. He frequently visited
                    the gaol in the<br/>city of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and
                    assisted the prisoners from<br/>his own purse, and from monies belonging to
                    associ-<br/>ations among the Friends. He did not live to see<br/>imprisonment
                    for debt abolished in the State of <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>; but he foresaw that the time would come,<br/>
                    when that blot on the fame of our country would be<br/>wiped away, not only in
                    this State, but in others.<br/>He preserved in his diary, a letter, which he
                    believed<br/>to have been written by the celebrated Indian, <a href="/people/wbran1">Brandt<persname key="wbran1"></persname></a>,<br/>who was educated at Dartmouth College.
                    It is so<br/>full of just remarks, and is, in itself, so great a<br/>curiosity,
                    that I thought it worthy of being pre-<br/>served.</p>
<floatingtext type="letter">
<opener><salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>Your letter came safe to hand. To give you<br/>entire satisfaction, I
                            must, I perceive, enter into the<br/> discussion of a subject, on which
                            I have often thought.<br/>My thoughts were my own, and, being so
                            different<br/>from the ideas entertained among your people, I<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_140" n="146"></pb>should certainly have carried them with me to
                            the<br/>grave, had I not received your obliging favour.</p>
<p>You ask me, then, whether, in my opinion, civili-<br/>zation is
                            favourable to human happiness? In answer<br/>to the question, it may be
                            answered, that there are<br/>degrees of civilization, from cannibals to
                            the most<br/> polite of European nations. The question is not,<br/>then,
                            whether a degree of refinement is not condu-<br/>cive to happiness, but
                            whether you, or the natives of<br/>this land, have obtained this happy
                            medium. On<br/>this subject we are, at present, I presume, of
                            very<br/>different opinions. You will, however, allow me, in<br/>some
                            respects, to have had the advantage of you in<br/>forming my sentiments.
                            I was, Sir, born of Indian<br/>parents, and lived, while a child, among
                            those whom<br/>you are pleased to call savages. I was
                            afterwards<br/>sent to live among the white people, and educated
                            at<br/>one of your schools; since which period, I have been<br/>honoured
                            much beyond my deserts, by an acquaint-<br/>ance with a number of
                            principal characters, both in<br/><a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> and America. After all this experience, and<br/>
                            after every exertion to divest myself of prejudice, I<br/> am obliged to
                            give my opinion in favour of my own<br/>people. I will now, as much as I
                            am able, collect<br/>together, and set before you, some of the reasons
                            that<br/>have influenced my judgment on the subject now<br/>before us.
                            In the government you call civilized, the<br/>happiness of the people is
                            constantly sacrificed to the<br/>splendour of empire. Hence your codes
                            of criminal<br/>and civil laws have had their origin; from
                            hence<br/>your dungeons and prisons. I will not enlarge on an<br/>idea,
                            so singular in civilized life, and, perhaps, dis-<br/>agreeable to you;
                            I will only observe, that among<br/>us we have <emph rend="italic">no</emph> prisons. We have no pompous parade<br/> of courts; we
                            have no written laws, and yet judges<br/> are as highly revered among us
                            as they are among <br/>you, and their decisions as much regarded.
                            Property,<br/> to say the least, is as well guarded, and crimes
                            are<br/>as impartially punished. We have among us, no<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_141" n="147"></pb>splendid villains above the control of our laws.<br/> Daring
                            wickedness is here never suffered to triumph<br/> over helpless
                            innocence; the estates of widows and<br/>orphans are never devoured by
                            enterprising sharpers.<br/>In a word, we have no robbery under the
                            colour of<br/>law. No person among us desires any other reward<br/>for
                            performing a brave and worthy action, but the<br/>consciousness of
                            having served his Nation. Our wise<br/>men are called Fathers—they truly
                            sustain that cha-<br/>racter ; they are always accessible, I will not
                            say to<br/>the meanest of our people, for we have none mean,<br/>but
                            such as render themselves so by their vices.</p>
<p>The palaces and prisons among you form a most<br/>dreadful contrast. Go
                            to the former places, and you<br/>will see, perhaps, <emph rend="italic">a deformed piece of earth</emph>, assuming<br/>airs that become
                            none but the Great Spirit above;<br/> go to one of your prisons;—here
                            description utterly<br/> fails. Kill them, if you please—kill them, too,
                            by<br/> torture; but let the torture last no longer than a day.<br/>
                            Those you call savages, relent; the most furious of<br/>our tormentors
                            exhausts his rage in a few hours, and<br/>despatches the unhappy victim
                            with a sudden stroke.<br/> Perhaps, it is eligible that incorrigible
                            offenders should<br/>sometimes be cut off—Let it be done in a way
                            that<br/>is not degrading to human nature; let such unhap-<br/>py men
                            have an opportunity, by the fortitude of their<br/> death, of making an
                            atonement, in some measure,<br/> for the crimes they have committed
                            during their lives.</p>
<p>But, for what are many of your prisoners con-<br/>fined?—For
                            debt.—Astonishing! And will you ever<br/>again call the Indian nation
                            cruel? Liberty, to a ra-<br/>tional creature, as much exceeds property,
                            as the light<br/> of the sun does that of the most twinkling star.<br/>
                            But you put them on a level, to the everlasting dis-<br/>grace of
                            civilization! I knew, while I lived among<br/>the white people, many of
                            the most amiable contract<br/>debts, and, I dare say, with the best
                            intentions. Both<br/>parties, at the time of the contract, expect to
                            find<br/>their advantage. The debtor, we will suppose, by a <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_142" n="148"></pb>train of unavoidable misfortunes, fails; here is
                            no<br/>crime, nor even a fault; and yet, your laws put it in<br/>the
                            power of the creditor to throw the debtor into<br/>prison, and confine
                            him there for life!—a punishment<br/> infinitely worse than death to a
                            brave man; and, I<br/>seriously declare, I had rather die by the most
                            severe<br/>tortures ever inflicted on this continent, than
                            languish<br/>in one of your prisons for a single year. Great
                            Spirit<br/>of the universe! And do you call yourselves Christ-<br/>ians
                            ? does, then, the religion of Him whom you call<br/>your Saviour,
                            inspire this spirit, and lead to these<br/>practices?—Surely, no. It is
                            recorded of Him, that a<br/> bruised reed he never broke. Cease, then,
                            to call<br/>yourselves Christians, lest you publish to the
                            world<br/>your hypocrisy. Cease, too, to call other nations<br/>savage,
                            when you are tenfold more the children of<br/>cruelty than they.</p>

<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> did not confine himself to labours of

                    country. Inland<br/> navigation had early engaged his attention; but<br/>there
                    must have been many minds at work in<br/>planning and carrying into effect the

                            an<br/>undertaking that ranks among the most important<br/>that has been

                            event has<br/>secured to this state and nation.</p>
<p>The question, then, here naturally presents itself,<br/>Who first
                            projected the system of inland navigation<br/> from the Lakes to the
                                <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname>, and the Atlantic<br/>
                            Ocean? and who were the instruments of its accom-<br/>plishment? In
                            replying to these important inquiries,<br/>I am fully aware of the
                            delicacy of the task before me.</p>
<p>The claimants to this honour are numerous and<br/>respectable, and the
                            claims of each to a certain ex-<br/>tent founded in justice. While the
                            minute details<br/>upon this subject are passed over as out of place
                            on<br/> the present occasion, I trust it will not be uninte-<br/>resting
                            to this intelligent assembly, to advert to a<br/>brief sketch of the
                            most interesting facts which this<br/>examination has enabled me to
                            develop, some of<br/>which, it will be found, have hitherto been
                            totally<br/>overlooked in the public communications that
                            have<br/>appeared upon this subject. In viewing the origin<br/>and
                            progress of this great achievement, our attention<br/>is drawn to its
                            numerous friends, who have, in va-<br/>rious capacities, contributed to
                            its accomplishment.<br/>But, in order that each of the numerous
                            benefactors<br/>to this work may have his due share of praise,
                            pro-<br/>portioned to the services he has rendered, it is pro-<br/>posed
                            to divide them into various classes, designating<br/>the nature,
                            character, and extent of those services.<br/>I am fully sensible that
                            fame has given to some a<br/> degree of reputation to which they are not
                            entitled,<br/>to the extent in which it is bestowed; while to
                            others<br/>much is due for the assistance they have rendered<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_144" n="150"></pb>in the accomplishment of this important work, and<br/>whose
                            contributions are comparatively little known<br/>to the world, or have
                            been but imperfectly acknow-<br/>ledged. So far, therefore, as laborious
                            inquiry has<br/>enabled me to ascertain the facts now to be

<p>The contributors to canal navigation in the state<br/>of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, may be considered as consisting
                            of<br/>four great classes: in the first, may be enumerated,<br/>those
                            foreseeing and predicting from the general<br/>face of the country, the
                            union of the lakes, the creeks<br/>and rivers of the west, by measures
                            calculated to<br/>remove obstructions, improve the natural
                            navigation<br/>then existing, and ultimately, by different outlets,
                            to<br/>connect the same with the ocean. In this class, the<br/>names of
                                <a href="/people/ccold1">Cadwallader Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/hmoor1">Sir Henry Moore<persname key="hmoor1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/gwash1">George Washington<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/gclin1">George
                                Clinton<persname key="gclin1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/gmorr1">Gouver-neur
                                Morris<persname key="gmorr1"></persname></a>, are prominent. In the second class, are<br/>to be
                            noticed, those who proposed, by artificial navi-<br/>gation or canals,
                            to form a connexion between the<br/>waters of the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname> and <geogname key="lakeo">Lake
                            Ontario</geogname>, <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>,<br/>or
                            both. <a href="/people/ccoll1">Christopher Colles<persname key="ccoll1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jsmit5">Jeffrey Smith<persname key="jsmit5"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/ewats1">ElkanahWatson<persname key="ewats1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/pschu1">Philip

                            and <a href="/people/jform1">JoshuaForeman<persname key="jform1"></persname></a>, deserve the
                            most honourable mention in this<br/>place. Thirdly, those who, in the
                            year <date when="1810">1810</date>, have<br/>been chiefly instrumental
                            in effecting a direct inter-<br/>nal communication between <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> and the<br/>Atlantic. In this
                            class, <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jplat1">Jonas Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a>,<br/>and <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, stand conspicuous.
                            Fourthly,<br/>another class of benefactors to this great work,
                            is<br/>composed of numerous members of both Houses of<br/>the
                            Legislature, who took a prominent station in<br/> devising and
                            sustaining the measures necessary to<br/>carry the same into effect; the
                            various canal com-<br/>missioners, engineers, surveyors, and many
                            private<br/>but public spirited citizens, in various parts of the
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_145" n="151"></pb>state, who have zealously given their personal
                            atten-<br/>tions and services to this herculean undertaking, and<br/>to
                            whom too much praise cannot be ascribed: so<br/>great is the number
                            composing this class, that I am<br/>compelled, at this time, to forbear
                            from their enume-<br/>ration. The commissioners of the canal fund,
                            as<br/>distinguished from that of Canal Commissioners, and<br/>composed
                            of the Lieutenant Governor, the Comptrol-<br/>ler, the Attorney General,
                            the Surveyor General, the<br/> Secretary and Treasurer, to whose special
                            care are<br/>committed the regulations of the tolls, and other
                            cir-<br/>cumstances relating to the government of the canal,<br/>are
                            entitled to high approbation, for their intelligent<br/>and faithful
                            discharge of the duties assigned them.<br/>To all these different
                            classes of coadjutors, may be<br/>ascribed a high and enviable measure
                            of applause.</p>
<p>The sagacity of some, in early perceiving the prac-<br/>ticability, and
                            utility, of the inland communication;<br/>the diligence and zeal of
                            others, in unremitted exer-<br/>tions to accomplish it; and the devotion
                            and sacri-<br/>fices of all to its completion, will be remembered
                            by<br/>their successors with everlasting gratitude.</p>

<p>We, fortunately, have been able to get <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.

<p>I was one (says he) of the first Directors of the<br/>Western Inland Lock

                            until the com-<br/>pany disposed of their property to the state, in
                                <date when="1820">1820</date>.<br/>I applied myself, with much zeal,
                            in forwarding the<br/>views of the company, and in improving the
                            inter-<br/>nal navigation of the state. Our funds were
                            not<br/>sufficient to extend any improvement, further than<br/>a few
                            miles west of <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>. The company had

                            of making improvements in<br/>the navigation, as far as that place.
                            Being well<br/>satisfied, from my own observation, of the

                            of<br/>canals, &amp;c., through the western parts of the state,
                            and<br/>considering the incalculable advantages that would<br/>result
                            from the completion of such a magnificent<br/>work, my mind was devoted
                            to its accomplishment.<br/>As I was active in the prosecution of the
                            improve-<br/>ments made by the Western Inland Lock
                            Navigation<br/>Company, the geography and topography of the<br/>western
                            parts of this state were very familiar to<br/>my mind, and having been
                            very intimate with Mr.<br/><a href="/people/wwest1">Weston<persname key="wwest1"></persname></a>,
                            when he was in this country, employed by<br/>the company as Canal
                            Engineer, and having accom-<br/>panied him in exploring the country,
                            from <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a> to<br/><geogname key="cayug">Cayuga Lake</geogname>, in <date when="1796">1796</date>, and being
                            repeatedly with<br/>him, whilst he was employed on the canals on
                                the<br/><geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname>, my knowledge
                            of the whole face of<br/>the country fixed in my mind an ardent desire
                            to<br/> extend a complete canal navigation, from <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a> to<br/><geogname key="sener">Seneca
                                river</geogname>. Occasionally, for many years, I urged<br/>the
                            Western Canal Company to extend their im-<br/>provements further west. A
                            vast sum of money had<br/>been expended by them in improving the
                            navigation<br/>of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname>, which,
                            for many years, absorbed<br/>the tolls, and prevented a dividend being
                            made<br/>among the stockholders. Under these circumstances,<br/>no
                            importunities of mine could prevail on the com-<br/>pany to make
                            advances for further improvements.<br/>In <date when="1810-03">March,
                                1810</date>, I was at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and
                            it occurred to<br/>me, that probably the Legislature might be
                            induced<br/> to appoint commissioners, to examine and explore<br/>the
                            western parts of the state, for the purpose of<br/>ascertaining the
                            practicability of extending canal<br/>navigation, and to estimate the
                            expense, and report<br/> thereon. 1 was pertectly convinced, that if
                            commis-<br/>sioners should be appointed, they would make a<br/>very
                            favourable report. My friend, <a href="/people/jplat1">Jonas
                                Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a>, (now <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_147" n="153"></pb>one of the Judges of the
                            Supreme Court) was then a<br/>member of the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>, and on the evening of the <date when="1810-03-12">12th<br/>of March</date>, I called upon him, and suggested to him
                            a<br/>plan, on which I had never consulted any person, of<br/>proposing
                            to the Legislature, to appoint Commission-<br/>ers, as before mentioned;
                            and I proposed to him, that<br/>he should use his endeavours in the
                                <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>, to far-<br/>ther the plan. He
                            replied, he very highly approved<br/>of my proposition, and asked why
                            not make it the<br/>duty of these commissioners to explore the
                            country,<br/>as far as <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>, with
                            the view to ascertain the<br/>practicability of making a complete canal,
                            from<br/>thence to the Hudson? We immediately drafted a<br/>joint
                            resolution, to be offered to both branches of the<br/>Legislature, which
                            it was agreed he should present<br/>to the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a> next morning. We also thought it<br/>would be
                            proper for us, then to fix on suitable names<br/>to offer to the
                                <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>, as Commissioners, and
                            we<br/>agreed in the necessity of selecting persons equally<br/>from the
                            two great political parties, which then divi-<br/>ded the state. This we
                            did, according to the best<br/>judgment we could form, and the following
                            gentle-<br/>men were named, viz., <a href="/people/gmorr1">Gouverneur
                                Morris<persname key="gmorr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/dclin1">De

                                <a href="/people/pport1">Peter B. Porter<persname key="pport1"></persname></a>.<br/> It was
                            concluded that I should meet <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge
                                Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a>, at<br/>the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>
                            Chamber, next morning, when I accord-<br/>ingly attended, and we called
                            out <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>,<br/> and showed
                            him the resolution. He expressed his<br/>hearty concurrence with our
                            plan, and as soon as<br/>the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a> was
                            formed, <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a> presented
                            the<br/>resolution, which we had prepared the previous even-<br/>ing. It
                            was seconded by <a href="/people/dclin1">Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, and passed
                            with-<br/>out a dissenting voice. It passed the house in the<br/>same
                            manner, within an hour after. In the summer<br/> of <date when="1810">1810</date>, I accompanied the other Commissioners,
                            in<br/>exploring the country, as far as <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogname>. In <date when="1811">1811</date>,<br/>we made our
                            first report to the Legislature. Several<br/> laws were enacted,
                            favourable to the prosecution of <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_148" n="154"></pb>the project,
                            notwithstanding which, the measure<br/>met with a serious and warm
                            opposition. The war<br/>with <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>
                            seemed to put a stop to all farther<br/>proceedings, and many persons
                            entertained serious<br/>doubts of the practicability of the undertaking,
                            and<br/>if practicable, that the resources of the state
                            were<br/>incompetent to secure its completion. Besides
                            these<br/>difficulties, the measure was opposed, with great<br/>warmth,
                            on party grounds. Thus circumstanced,<br/>after the war, the friends of
                            the project appeared to<br/>be entirely discouraged, and to have given
                            up all<br/> hopes of the Legislature being induced again to take<br/>up
                            the subject, or adopt any measure to prosecute the<br/>scheme. However,
                            I could not thus resign a favourite<br/>project; and, it appeared to me,
                            that one more effort<br/> should be made; and <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a>, being then (Au-<br/>tumn of <date when="1815">1815</date>) in the city, holding court, I wrote
                            a<br/>note, inviting him to breakfast with me the next<br/>morning. He
                            came, and I proposed to him, that if it<br/>met his approbation, I would
                            undertake to get up<br/>a public meeting, to be held at the City Hotel,
                            in<br/>order to urge the propriety, and policy, of offering
                            a<br/>memorial to the Legislature, pressing them to prose-<br/>cute the
                            canal from <geogname key="lakee">Erie</geogname> to the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname>. <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge
                                Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a>,<br/> readily agreed to my proposition, and
                            consented to<br/>open the business to the meeting, if one could
                            be<br/>obtained. I then called on <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt
                                Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, who<br/>united with me in adopting measures to
                            procure a <br/>public meeting. Accordingly, a large and
                            respecta-<br/>ble meeting was held at the City Hotel. <a href="/people/wbaya1">WilliamBayard<persname key="wbaya1"></persname></a> was chairman. <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a> made an intro-<br/>ductory
                            speech, and was followed by <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt
                                Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/jswar1">John
                                Swartout<persname key="jswar1"></persname></a>, and others. <a href="/people/ccold1">Cadwallader
                                D. Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jswar1">John Swartout<persname key="jswar1"></persname></a>, and myself,
                            were<br/>appointed a committee, to draft a memorial to
                            the<br/>Legislature. This memorial was drawn up by <a href="/people/dclin1">DeWitt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, and from the masterly
                            manner in<br/>which it was written, it was evident he had a
                            com-<br/>plete knowledge of the subject, and evinced the un-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_149" n="155"></pb>common talents of the author. It was signed by<br/>many
                            thousands in the city, and throughout the<br/>state. With the
                            Legislature, it had the desired effect,<br/>and was the means of
                            establishing the canal policy<br/>on a firm basis, and producing the law
                            of <date when="1817-04-15">15th of<br/>April, 1817</date>, directing the
                            work to be commenced,<br/>which was accordingly done on the <date when="1817-07-04">4th of July</date><br/> following.</p>
<p>From the period of presenting the first report of<br/>the commissioners
                            to the legislature, in <date when="1812">1812</date>, to the<br/>passing
                            of the act of <date when="1817">1817</date>, (excepting two years
                            of<br/>the war with <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>) I
                            attended the several ses-<br/>sions of the Legislature, for the purpose
                            of interesting<br/>the members in the great project of the
                            proposed<br/>canal, from <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> to
                            the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogname>. <a href="/people/dclin1">De WittClinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, and myself, were
                            uniformly engaged in<br/>using every means in our power, by
                            distributing<br/> pamphlets, and endeavouring to explain to the
                            mem-<br/>bers, the great value and importance of such a canal,<br/>and
                            showing them the great advantages the state<br/>would derive, as to its
                            agricultural and commercial<br/> improvements, and the increase of
                            revenue, from tolls.<br/>We were encouraged to pursue further exertions,
                            by<br/>procuring an act, in <date when="1813">1813</date>, which
                            authorized the com-<br/>missioners to obtain a loan of five millions of
                            dollars,<br/>to enable the state to prosecute the grand
                            under-<br/>taking. This act was afterwards repealed, and<br/>nothing
                            further was done during the war, and from<br/>the period of the
                            termination, until the meeting held<br/>at the City Hotel, in the latter
                            part of the year <date when="1815">1815</date>.<br/>The friends of the
                            plan were much discouraged, in<br/>consequence of the violent opposition
                            it met with<br/>from men not capable of forming a correct
                            judgment<br/>as to the practicability of the work.</p>
<p>From the year <date when="1810">1810</date>, I devoted most of my time,
                            in<br/>endeavouring, in connexion with <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt
                                Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>,<br/>and <a href="/people/rfult1">Robert
                                Fulton<persname key="rfult1"></persname></a>, to enlighten the public mind,<br/>respecting it,

<p>Ever watching the progress of philanthropy, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> early saw the great utility of Savings
                    Banks.<br/>This excellent institution had its origin as late as<br/><date when="1803">1803</date>. From this period, the benevolent were deeply<br/>
                    engaged in establishing savings banks in every city,<br/>town, or village, where
                    they were required. The first<br/>savings bank that was put into operation in
                    this<br/> country was established at <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, but almost<br/>simultaneously another at

                        Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a><br/>was a Director from its commencement until
                    his<br/>death, and for some time Vice President of it. There<br/>are now more
                    than fifty of these savings banks in<br/>the United States, which have been of
                    an incalcula-<br/>ble benefit to the poor. A bank not only saves
                    their<br/>money, which might have been foolishly expended,<br/>but it gives a
                    poor person no small degree of respec-<br/>tability among all classes of people,
                    when he is pro-<br/>vident enough to put his spare earnings into such
                    an<br/>institution.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was an active and zealous member
                    of<br/>the New York Bible Society, and amongst the first to<br/>lend his aid to
                    its establishment as early as <date when="1806">1806</date>, and<br/>continued
                    his connexion with it until the time of his<br/>death. This Society was founded
                    only two years<br/>after the parent society in <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>. The origin of<br/>the Society is a singular fact in
                    history. It is said,<br/>that a Welsh divine, good as he of the same
                    country<br/> described by Swift, whose cassock was out at elbows,<br/>travelled
                    to <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, and stated to some of the
                    reli-<br/>gious societies the want of bibles in his flock, and the<br/>great
                    scarcity of them throughout all <a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a>.
                    This<br/>statement set the pious to making inquiries, and a <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_151" n="157"></pb>great want of them was discovered in the army and<br/>navy, and in fact almost
                    every where. In a short<br/>time a society was formed, whose growth has
                    no<br/>parallel in the history of nations. In less than thirty<br/>years, the
                    branches of this noble society have caused<br/>the Scriptures to be translated
                    and printed in more<br/>than a hundred different languages, and spread
                    it<br/>over the charitable globe. This book is now familiar<br/>to the <a href="/organizations/eskimo">Esquimaux<orgname key="eskimo"></orgname></a> of our northern regions, is spread<br/>
                    throughout Asia, and is known in Africa. From five<br/>thousand Bible Societies
                    that can be enumerated,<br/>issued every year almost an incredible number
                    of<br/>volumes, and therefore no one will perish for lack of<br/>vision. These
                    bibles have not only spread the chris-<br/>tian religion, but have been the
                    means of introducing<br/>letters where they have been unknown before.
                    The<br/>first talents of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> have been
                    engaged in transla-<br/>ting them into various languages, previously but
                    little<br/> known, even to the learned.</p>
<p>With a sagacity that seems to foresee the results of<br/>the experience of many
                    years, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was for<br/>having the bible
                    go out without note or commentary,<br/>that good sense and faith might have
                    their full influ-<br/>ence. This is now, after all the experience had on<br/>the
                    subject, thought to be the best course to pursue.</p>
<p>The success of these societies have had salutary<br/>influence among those who
                    have been engaged in<br/>the cause. Many young men have read the Bible<br/>with
                    care and attention, who never would have done<br/>it, if the societies of which
                    they were members had<br/>not had before them subjects of discussion,
                    requiring<br/>something more than a cursory knowledge of the<br/>Scriptures.
                    Youth is ambitious, and will not be<br/>ignorant of that which it is
                    praiseworthy to obtain,<br/>if rightly set before them. Another beneficial
                    effect<br/>of the Bible, and other societies, of a charitable and<br/>religious
                    kind, is, that they draw young men from<br/>gay habits, and give them stability
                    and gravity in<br/>early life. In truth, it may be set down as an axiom,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_152" n="158"></pb>that when institutions of learning and benevolence<br/>increase,
                    frivolity and dissipation decrease.</p>
<p>The following reflections were found among <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s papers, in his own hand writing, and show<br/>how
                    deeply this great cause had sunk into his heart.</p>
<floatingtext type="narrative">
<p>The formation of the <a href="/organizations/ambib">American Bible
                                Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>, has<br/>often disposed my mind, to reflect on the
                            past and<br/>present state of society in the world. In the course<br/>of
                            such reflections, I am naturally led to admire the<br/>goodness and love
                            of the divine author of our exist-<br/>ence, in preparing, in his own
                            way, the improvement<br/>and melioration of mankind. His wisdom is
                            dis-<br/>played, in proportioning the degree of light to our<br/>weak
                            and feeble state. The splendour of the sun<br/>is preceded by the dawn
                            of day—so it is with respect<br/>to the many essential and important
                            truths, with<br/>which the minds of men have been enlightened
                            at<br/>different periods of the world. Thus, formerly, an<br/>eye for an
                            eye, a tooth for a tooth, or the life of an<br/> offender as an
                            expiation for his crime, were the rude<br/>summary laws, which <emph rend="italic">then</emph> seemed to be the perfec-<br/>tion of
                            justice. But the mild principles of the Chris-<br/>tian religion, held
                            out an easy and simple lesson for<br/>the instruction of men, and taught
                                them—<quote type="biblical">Whatso-<br/>ever ye would that men
                                should do to you, do you<br/>even so to them</quote>—<quote type="biblical">love your enemies—do good<br/>unto them that
                                despitefully use you.</quote>—It is certain,<br/>that even many of
                            those, who were not baptized into<br/>the spirit of our holy religion,
                            were considerably in-<br/>fluenced by these solemn and self-evident
                            truths.</p>
<p>It requires but a very slight acquaintance either<br/>with the principles
                            of human nature, or the history<br/>of civil society, to be convinced,
                            that until the human<br/>mind became capable of perceiving the enormity
                            of<br/> tolerating slavery, and the cruel injustice of holding<br/>a
                            portion of human beings in a state of abject bond-<br/>age, we should
                            never have been able to discover<br/>the necessity of those prudent,
                            humane, and salutary<br/> regulations, which have taken the place of
                            sangui-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_153" n="159"></pb>nary penal laws.—Thus, also, has christian
                            sym-<br/>pathy been gradually developed, and brought into<br/>action
                            that spirit of philanthropy, which desires to<br/>promote the welfare of
                                <emph rend="italic">every</emph> part of the human<br/>family. Hence
                            we have been led into the exercise<br/>of those benign affections, which
                            have pointed out to<br/>us the reasonableness and propriety of pursuing
                            a<br/> course of mild and humane treatment, towards
                            those<br/>unfortunate persons who are afflicted with a dimi-<br/>nution
                            or aberration of intellect.</p>
<p>At this auspicious period let us pause—a scene of<br/>activity presents
                            itself, fraught with an increase of<br/>knowledge, enlargement of mind,
                            and new powers<br/>of rational enjoyment.—A new impulse has
                            been<br/>given to the Christian family, and its influence ex-<br/>tends
                            to every part of the world.</p>
<p>The present age may be regarded as most remark-<br/>ably auspicious to
                            the interests of mankind, it is<br/>marked by the union of benevolent
                            persons of all<br/>religious denominations, for the promotion of
                            useful<br/>objects; an improved system of education has been<br/>reared
                            up for youth, which has laid the foundation<br/>of the greatest progress
                            in intellectual and moral<br/> improvement that the world has hitherto
                            known.<br/>First day, or Sunday Schools, are established; and
                            to<br/>crown all, the British and Foreign Bible Society has<br/>been
                            organized, and in full operation, with wonder-<br/>ful success, and on
                            this day we celebrate the third<br/>anniversary of the <a href="/organizations/ambib">American Bible Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>.—The<br/>effects
                            produced by <emph rend="italic">this</emph> union are equal to the
                            most<br/>sanguine expectations of its founders—<quote type="biblical">But Paul<br/>may plant, and Apollos may water, but God
                                alone<br/>giveth the increase.</quote>—Relying on a continuance
                            of<br/> blessings from on high, the fervent friend of
                            Bible<br/>Societies, viewing with gratitude the success of
                            these<br/>institutions in disseminating the oracles of divine<br/>truth,
                            looks towards the times, when the fruits of<br/> this seed shall be
                            universally visible—he anticipates,<br/>with joy, what has been in part
                            accomplished—that<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_154" n="160"></pb>Bible Societies throughout the
                            Christian world, have<br/>been, in the hands of Providence, the means of
                            effect-<br/>ing a union of Christians, who, once widely sepa-<br/>rated
                            from each other, by countries, forms, and names,<br/>have daily
                            approximated, and coalesced, as it were,<br/>into one spiritual body,
                            proclaiming to the world,<br/><q>that the true and invisible church, is
                                not to be re-<br/>stricted by the narrow limits of <emph rend="italic">any</emph> particular sect,<br/>or outward form,
                                but comprehends all the genuine<br/>worshippers of our God, and his
                                Christ, in every part<br/>of the habitable globe.</q> How cheering,
                            how anima-<br/>ting are the happy effects, prospectively, that
                            must<br/>result from supplying the poor and destitute with<br/>that
                            book, which contains the words, the sayings,<br/>and testimonies of God,
                            pointing out a direct, plain,<br/>and luminous path to immortality,
                            promising the<br/>assistance, and requiring submission to the
                            same<br/>spirit that inspired the holy penmen.</p>
<p>In the present enlightened period, when peace per-<br/>vades the whole
                            world, is it too much to indulge the<br/>hope, that the time is not
                                <emph rend="italic">very</emph> remote, when the pro-<br/>phecy
                            shall be fulfilled—<quote type="biblical">Nation shall not lift
                                up<br/>sword against nation, neither shall they learn war<br/>any
                                more.</quote>—Though the Prince of this world may<br/>still have
                            rule among the people, we may in the<br/>spirit of meekness pray—<emph rend="italic">thy</emph> kingdom come.—We<br/>may hope, that
                            predisposing causes, in the hand of<br/>divine Providence, may effect
                            such a universal<br/>change in the minds of men, as will finally
                            extir-<br/>pate the root of bitterness, and every evil passion
                            that<br/>serves to engender wars and fightings; and in room<br/>thereof,
                            men may learn to love each other, which is<br/>the essential and true
                            mark of a disciple and follower<br/>of the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>From observations made upon the state of society<br/>in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>
                    came to the con-<br/>clusion, that one great cause of crime was
                    pauperism,<br/>which, in most instances in this country, arose
                    from<br/>ignorance in the poorer classes of the people; and, that<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_155" n="161"></pb>those who would do the best for the community, must<br/>strike at
                    the root of this evil, by teaching the children<br/>of the poor to read and
                    write, that they might be<br/>able to find useful employment, or learn some
                    trade<br/>to enable them to earn a competent subsistence.<br/>As this subject
                    was deeply impressed on his mind,<br/>he frequently corresponded with his friend
                        <a href="/people/pcolq1">PatrickColquhoun<persname key="pcolq1"></persname></a>, of <a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, who entertained similar<br/>views, and
                    he had, of course, the light of that<br/>powerful mind to assist him. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was tho-<br/>roughly convinced of the
                    efficacy of the system of<br/>general instruction in operation in the Eastern
                    States;<br/>but, he thought, that it would be quite impossible to<br/>bring the
                    Legislature of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> to pass a law
                    for<br/>such a school system, at that time;—such a one<br/>must grow up
                    radically with a people—it cannot<br/>easily be done, after the population is
                    numerous, and<br/> wealth has greatly increased. The rich man will<br/>not
                    consent that he should be taxed, according to his<br/>property, to maintain
                    schools, and then see that<br/>money distributed in districts, according to the
                    num-<br/>ber of children under a certain age, such as usually<br/>attend an
                    instructor the whole or a portion of a<br/>year.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had frequently conversed with
                    his<br/>friends, <a href="/people/jmurr1">John Murray, jun.<persname key="jmurr1"></persname></a> and
                        <a href="/people/mfran1">Matthew Franklin<persname key="mfran1"></persname></a>, on<br/>the subject of
                    schools; and, in <date when="1805-02">February, 1805</date>, they<br/>proposed
                    to him, to form an association of Friends,<br/>to establish a free school, for
                    the benefit of poor child-<br/>ren, not members of their religious society. To
                        this<br/><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> objected, as he thought
                    it would be impos-<br/>sible to raise funds sufficient to support a school,<br/>
                    except on a small scale, if it was confined to Friends<br/>alone. He then
                    proposed to call to his aid a num-<br/>ber of respectable citizens, of different
                    religious de-<br/>nominations. The meeting was called; it was gene-<br/>rally
                    attended by the most active classes in the city,<br/>and a committee was
                    appointed to raise funds by<br/> subscription; and, also, to apply to the
                    Legislature<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_156" n="162"></pb>for assistance. An act of incorporation, under
                    the<br/>name of the <a href="/organizations/nyfss">Society for establishing a Free
                        School<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>,<br/>in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, for the education of such<br/>poor children as do not
                    belong to, or are not provided<br/>for by, any religious society, was obtained.
                    The school<br/>was soon opened, and twelve scholars admitted. From<br/>this
                    exertion, grew the splendid system of education<br/>now in operation in the
                    state of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. There had<br/>been some
                    legislative provisions previously enacted,<br/>but the act had expired, without
                    producing any<br/>beneficial effects. At the commencement of the sys-<br/>tem,
                    the instruction was confined to the poor, who<br/>were not otherwise provided
                    for; at length it extend-<br/>ed to all classes, and the reluctance that was
                    felt, by<br/>those in good circumstances, to sending their child-<br/>ren to
                    these common schools, is every day diminish-<br/>ing, and will soon cease
                    altogether. The first men<br/>of New England were educated in their
                    common<br/>schools.* <note rend="asterisk" resp="editor"> * In New England, although every man
                        who pays a tax, has a vote not<br/>only in general elections, but, also, in
                        town offices, and in raising money<br/> and expending it; yet, the wealthy
                        and well-to-do, have to take care of<br/>the poor; for, in many instances,
                        they have been opposed to raising money<br/>for their common schools. In a
                        town in <a href="/places/mass">Massachusetts<placename key="mass"></placename></a>, of no
                        inconsidera-<br/>ble size, where education is under the best of regulations,
                        a proposition was<br/>made, in town-meeting, to establish another school. A
                        poor man who often<br/>admired his own eloquence in these primary
                        assemblies, opposed the measure<br/>on the ground of oppressive taxation and
                        spoke so strongly that many began<br/>to doubt the expediency of
                        establishing another school at that time. A friend<br/> to the proposition
                        for another school followed the orator. He had prepared<br/> to meet this
                        influence. He showed, in the first place, that the speaker, who<br/> alone
                        opposed the measure, had been the father of ten sons, who were all edu-<br/>
                        cated at the common schools in town, and that these sons had, on an
                        ave-<br/>rage, been at school seven years each. The gentlemen who argued in
                        favour<br/>of the additional school, next exhibited the school tax, from the
                        time the oppo-<br/>ser first paid a tax, to that year, and showed that his
                        proportion of the whole<br/>sum, for the seven years schooling of his boys,
                        had been 39 cents only.<br/> They were bright boys, and often obtained
                        prizes of books. Such is preju-<br/>dice without calculation. EDITOR.

                EDUCATION.
                <p>Though not the first among the states of the con-<br/>federacy to introduce the
                    system of universal educa-<br/>tion, <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>
                    may, with some truth, be said to<br/>have surpassed all the other states, in the
                    liberality,<br/>as well as the sound policy, of her provisions for
                    its<br/>maintenance. She has happily taken the due means<br/>between relying
                    wholly upon taxation on the one<br/>hand, and upon accumulated funds on the
                    other, for<br/>the support of schools throughout her community.<br/>She has
                    avoided the error of applying all her legis-<br/>lation to a single class of
                    institutions; thus showing<br/>a spirit above the petty jealousy that would
                    annihi-<br/>late the higher, and a sense and patriotism that im-<br/>peratively
                    forbade her to neglect the lower semina-<br/>ries of learning. We do not find
                    colleges and uni-<br/>versities multiplied till one actually devours
                    another,<br/>while the mass of the community is without even<br/>the ordinary
                    rudiments of knowledge; nor do we<br/>perceive, on the contrary, the avenues to
                    classical at-<br/>tainments so hedged about by the expensiveness,
                    the<br/>useless requisitions, and the forbidding ceremonials<br/>which might
                    appal the youth, whose <emph rend="italic">treasures were<br/> only of the
                        mind</emph>, from attempting to gain the station<br/>in society, for which
                    his natural endowments had<br/>qualified him.</p>
<p>There does not appear any ostentatious display<br/>of extravagance in her
                    expenditures for education,—<br/>nor any of that niggardly parsimony which
                    would<br/>compel the people to buy a cheap commodity of<br/> learning, sure, at
                    the same time, that it must be a<br/><emph rend="italic">poor</emph> one.</p>
<p>She has not hesitated, while prosecuting the most<br/>magnificent schemes for
                    improving the value of her<br/>physical resources, to devise and execute plans
                    far<br/>more magnificent for the development of her intel-<br/>lectual
                    treasures. It has not been the spirit of her<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_158" n="164"></pb>measures to
                    consign a whole generation <emph rend="italic">now existing</emph><br/>to
                    brutish ignorance, in order that the <emph rend="italic">next</emph>
                    might<br/>riot in its earnings, and sink in the same manner<br/>into oblivion,
                    without having been provided with<br/>means of any rational enlargement of the
                    most<br/> ennobling faculties. She has not been terrified by<br/>the fear that
                    the coming age, which is to be the heir<br/>of her noble heritage of knowledge,
                    freedom, and<br/>moral power, should be compelled to pay out of its<br/>immense
                    resources, a few of the millions by which<br/>that heritage was originally
                    obtained. She has per-<br/>ceived it to be sound policy to incur a <emph rend="italic">debt</emph>, when the<br/>transaction is sure to multiply a
                    hundred fold the<br/>power of repaying it. The system of internal
                    im-<br/>provements, instead of absorbing and annihilating<br/>those very
                    resources which are wanted to sustain<br/>public spirit and intelligence, by
                    means of education,<br/>is, in <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, made
                    to minister directly and effec-<br/>tually to that object, and thus to react in
                    producing<br/>again the foresight and discernment which were<br/>alone requisite
                    to, understand the utility of those<br/>improvements, even before they had an
                    existence.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Origin of the System.</emph> The foundation of a sys-<br/>tem
                    of common schools was laid in this state nearly<br/>forty years ago. The first
                    act to that effect was<br/>passed <date when="1795-04-09">April 9, 1795</date>,
                    appropriating out of the annual<br/>revenues of the state, twenty thousand
                    pounds annu-<br/>ally, for five years, for the purpose of encouraging<br/>and
                    maintaining schools in the several cities and<br/>towns in the state. The
                    several counties were re-<br/>quired to raise a sum equal to one half of that
                    appro-<br/>priated to each by the state. At the expiration of<br/>this law, in
                        <date when="1800">1800</date>, the legislature refused to renew it;<br/>but,
                    in <date when="1805">1805</date>, impelled, probably, by a sense of the<br/>
                    deprivation under which the state laboured, in being<br/>again thrown back upon
                    voluntary, iridividual, or<br/>local efforts, the legislature passed an act,
                    providing<br/>that the nett proceeds of five hundred thousand acres<br/>of
                    vacant and unappropriated public lands should<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_159" n="165"></pb>be applied to
                    form a permanent fund for the support<br/>of common schools. In the same year,
                    three thou-<br/>sand shares of bank stock were ordered to be sub-<br/>scribed by
                    the state, and to belong to the school<br/>fund. No part of this fund was to be
                    applied to its<br/> ultimate object, until the interest should amount
                    to<br/>fifty thousand dollars annually.</p>
<p>In <date when="1811">1811</date>, measures were taken to organize and
                    es-<br/>tablish, in active force, a system of schools; such a<br/>system was
                        <emph rend="italic">reported</emph> in <date when="1812">1812</date>, and
                    the first distribu-<br/>tion of money under the provisions of <date when="1805">1805</date>, and in<br/>accordance with this system, were made in the year<br/>
<date when="1816">1816</date>. Besides the avails of the lands, and of
                    the<br/>bank stock, above mentioned, the legislature enacted,<br/>in <date when="1819">1819</date>, that one half the amount to be received
                        from<br/><emph rend="italic">quit rents</emph>; the <emph rend="italic">loans</emph> of <date when="1790">1790</date>, and of <date when="1808">1808</date>; the <emph rend="italic">shares</emph><br/>of the capital stock
                    of the Merchant's Bank, held by<br/>the state; the nett proceeds of <emph rend="italic">lands escheating</emph> to<br/>the state, in the military
                    tract; and the nett proceeds<br/>of the <emph rend="italic">fees</emph> of the
                    clerks of the supreme court, should<br/>all be assigned to this fund. In <date when="1824">1824</date>, a reservation<br/>in certain grants for lotteries,
                    amounting to forty<br/>thousand dollars, was added to the fund. In <date when="1826">1826</date>,<br/>it was enacted, that one hundred thousand
                    dollars<br/>should be annually distributed, by the state, for the<br/>support of
                    common schools; but, as the fund then<br/>produced but eighty-five thousand
                    dollars, the remain-<br/>ing fifteen thousand dollars were paid trom the
                    gene-<br/>ral funds of the state. In <date when="1827">1827</date>, further
                    appropria-<br/>tions, to make up the full amount of one hundred<br/>thousand
                    dollars, were made from the state loans of<br/><date when="1786">1786</date>,
                    and from the bank stock still held by the state.<br/>These two items amounted to
                    one hundred and<br/>thirty-three thousand six hundred and sixteen dollars.</p>
<p>In the same year, the credit of the state was<br/>pledged, in certificates of
                    stock, to a canal company,<br/>(the Hudson and Delaware,) which certificates
                    were<br/>to be sold, and the premiums obtained added to the<br/>school fund;
                    this transaction produced fifty thousand<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_160" n="166"></pb>dollars; and, finally,
                    a large number of town lots, at<br/><a href="/places/osweg2">Oswego<placename key="osweg2"></placename></a>,
                    amounting to ninety-one thousand three<br/>hundred and forty-nine dollars, were
                    sold in the<br/>same year, and the proceeds, together with all the<br/>sums
                    obtained from the above-mentioned sources,<br/>swelled the productive capital at
                    the beginning of<br/><date when="1828">1828</date>, to one million six hundred
                    and thirty thousand<br/>eight hundred and ninety-five dollars. The <emph rend="italic">constitu<br/>tion of the state</emph> provides, that the
                    proceeds of all<br/>lands which shall be hereafter sold, or disposed
                    of,<br/>shall belong to the fund for the support of common<br/>schools. In <date when="1830">1830</date>, these lands consisted of eight hun-<br/>dred and
                    sixty-nine thousand one hundred and<br/>seventy-eight acres, estimated at half a
                    million of<br/>dollars, which, added to the productive capital,<br/>makes two
                    millions one hundred and thirty thousand<br/>eight hundred and twenty-five
                    dollars. Besides the<br/>general fund of the state, there are likewise
                    several<br/>local funds arising out of certain reserved lands in<br/>the
                    respective counties. More than eighty towns are<br/>stated to participate in the
                    benefit of these funds,<br/>amounting to the sum of about seventeen
                    thousand<br/>dollars annually.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Progress of the System.</emph> The first distribution
                    of<br/>public moneys, out of the fund, was made, as we<br/>have said, in <date when="1816">1816</date>, and not till then, can the system<br/>be said to
                    have gone into actual operation. An esti-<br/>mate may be formed of the
                    influence of this system<br/>by comparing the state of things before the
                    funds<br/> became available, with that which has existed since.<br/>In sixteen
                    counties in which the state of schools was<br/>reported in <date when="1798">1798</date>, the number of schools was then one<br/>thousand three hundred
                    and fifty-two, and of scholars<br/>fifty-nine thousand six hundred and sixty. In
                        the<br/><emph rend="italic">same counties</emph>, in <date when="1828">1828</date>, the number of school districts<br/>established was two
                    thousand five hundred and<br/>eighty-six, and of scholars attending them, one
                    hun-<br/>dred and forty-two thousand three hundred and<br/>seventy-two. Even
                    this comparison falls far short<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_161" n="167"></pb>of exhibiting the actual
                    increase of schools, and of<br/> pupils throughout the state; for, in <date when="1798">1798</date>, there were<br/>in all but twenty-three counties
                    organized, and<br/>therefore only seven which did not report. But, in<br/><date when="1828">1828</date>, there were fifty-five counties, divided into
                    seven<br/> hundred and forty-two towns and wards, and eight<br/>thousand two
                    hundred and ninety-eight school dis-<br/>tricts, containing four hundred and
                    forty-one thou-<br/>sand eight hundred and fifty-six children. It is
                    true,<br/>there are other causes besides the inherent efficacy of<br/>the
                    system, which should be regarded in accounting<br/>for the rapid increase of
                    schools and pupils. The<br/>new counties formed subsequently to <date when="1798">1798</date>, were set-<br/>tled chiefly by emigrants from
                    New-England, who<br/>brought with them, as an essential part of
                    their<br/>existence, a habit of regarding <emph rend="italic">universal
                        education in<br/>common public schools</emph>, as among the primary
                    objects<br/> for which <emph rend="italic">laws</emph> are to be enacted. And
                    when the<br/>system had been once established, it is easy to see<br/>that its
                    operation upon the minds of new companies<br/>of such emigrants, must be to
                    determine them to select<br/>the state which had made this munificent
                    provision<br/>for that, which they consider as one of the first wants<br/>of
                    their nature, to be their permanent abode, in pre-<br/>ference to another, where
                    no such allurement was<br/>held out, whatever might otherwise be the
                    physical<br/>superiority of the latter. Thus we see, that the sys-<br/>tem of
                    common schools has reacted, in turn, in favour<br/>of population, and
                    consequently in favour of wealth<br/>and of power. physical, moral, and
                    political. </p>

<p>The collection of documents already issued under<br/>this requisition, contains a
                    most useful and instruc-<br/>tive mass of facts, which ought to be in the
                    hands<br/>of every state legislator in the union. It may be<br/>observed, that
                    the police of the general system is not<br/>applied in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, where, instead of<br/>commissioners of

                        people</emph>, the disbursements of the public<br/>money is entrusted to a
                    company, called the <q>Public<br/>School Society.</q> The reason or necessity of
                    this dif-<br/>ference of organization has never, to our knowledge,<br/>been made
                    evident.</p>
<p>In <date when="1832">1832</date>, the number of academies had risen
                    to<br/>fifty-nine, and the number of pupils was four thou-<br/>sand eight
                    hundred and eighty-eight, or seventy-one to<br/>each academy. In addition to the
                    means for support-<br/>ing common schools, the state has another
                    extensive<br/>fund, called the <emph rend="italic">literature fund</emph>, under
                    the manage-<br/>ment of the <q><emph rend="italic">Regents of the
                            University</emph>,</q> to which<br/>one hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars was added<br/>in <date when="1827">1827</date>, the income of which was
                    required to be dis-<br/>tributed to the several incorporated academies and<br/>
                    seminaries, in proportion to their numbers of pupils.<br/>It is gratifying to
                    observe, that a liberal spirit has<br/>been manifested in furnishing to these
                    institutions<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_165" n="171"></pb> various means and implements for cultivating
                    the<br/> natural sciences, and that some of them have already<br/>become useful
                    to science, by their application of these<br/>means. We may refer particularly
                    to the numerous<br/> sets of meteorological observations occasionally
                    pub-<br/>lished by the <q>Regents,</q> and which are all made at<br/>the
                    academies under their charge. The money ap-<br/>propriated to these
                    institutions, has been thus appli-<br/>ed with a view of converting them into
                    nurseries of<br/><emph rend="italic">teachers</emph> for the common schools.</p>
<p>As the latter are generally taught but a part of<br/>the year, that is, on an
                    average, not more than eight<br/>months, and as the teachers will generally be
                    other-<br/>wise engaged for a portion of their time, and will<br/>not be
                    permanently devoted to the business, it is high-<br/>ly important that the
                    greatest possible number of<br/> intelligent men should be found in every
                    precinct,<br/>capable of understanding the duties, if not of per-<br/>forming
                    the labours, of teachers. In a community<br/>thus fully supplied with
                    intelligent members, and<br/>impressed with the value of thorough
                    instruction,<br/>dulness and mediocrity will seldom find encourage-<br/>ment to
                    usurp the office and responsibility of guid-<br/>ing the intellectual pursuits
                    of the young; while the<br/>agents entrusted with the execution of the laws
                    on<br/>education will hesitate before they <quote type="biblical">lay
                        careless<br/>hands on sculls that cannot teach, and will not
                    learn.</quote></p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was also deeply engaged in the
                    erection<br/>of a House of Refuge, in the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. His<br/>worthy friend, Professor <a href="/people/jgris1">John Griscom<persname key="jgris1"></persname></a>, made the<br/>first suggestion of such
                    an institution to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/icoll1">Isaac Collins<persname key="icoll1"></persname></a>, and others, and in <date when="1823">1823</date>, they succeeded<br/>in establishing this truly useful charity.
                    The learn-<br/>ed and benevolent professor lives to see his institu-<br/>tion
                    flourish, as an auxiliary to all the great pur-<br/>poses of philanthropy to
                    which his friend, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>,<br/>was
                    devoted.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_166" n="172"></pb>
<p>With a strong desire to promote the interest of the<br/>State of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, several intelligent gentlemen of<br/>the
                    state formed a society <said who="undetermined">for the acquisition
                        and<br/>diffusion of all useful intelligence connected with<br/>the inland
                        trade and navigation of the country.</said><br/>The society was called, the
                    New-York Corresponding<br/>Association for the Promotion of Internal
                    Improve-<br/>ment. When the association was organized, <a href="/people/dclin1">DeWitt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a> was chosen President, and
                        Doctor<br/><a href="/people/smitc1">Samuel L. Mitchell<persname key="smitc1"></persname></a>, and the
                    Hon. <a href="/people/ccold1">Cadwallader D.Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>, Vice
                    Presidents, and <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, Chairman<br/>of
                    the committee of correspondence and publication.<br/>The association exerted
                    themselves for several years<br/>with great assiduity, and the labours of the
                    chairman<br/>were very arduous, but promptly discharged. Who<br/>has now the
                    records of that association, I have not<br/>been able to discover, but much
                    valuable information<br/>must have been collected by such indefatigable
                    and<br/>intellectual men as formed that association; and it is<br/>well known,
                    that their publications were numerous.</p>
<p>On the great subject of slavery, which is now agi-<br/>tating the world,
                        <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> took an early part. He<br/>saw
                    millions suffering in bondage, and willed them<br/>to be free; but this was not
                    enough; he knew that<br/>means must be applied to ends, and that it was
                    in<br/>vain to deplore the condition of the Africans without<br/>strenuous
                    exertions. He was an active member of<br/>the Abolition and Manumission
                    Societies, and corres-<br/>ponded with the philanthropists of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> on the<br/>subject, as well as with the
                    leaders in the cause of<br/>freedom in <a href="/places/haiti">Hayti<placename key="haiti"></placename></a>.
                    He saw, as every wise man does,<br/>that the evil was one that increased in
                    magnitude<br/>every day, and as time advanced, became more diffi-<br/>cult to
                    eradicate. It was the voice of such philan-<br/>thropists, that assisted the
                    politicians in fixing the<br/>boundaries of the slave-trade, which was the
                    first<br/>step in the march of this charity; and which, if judi-<br/>ciously
                    followed up, will, in the end, drive the evil from<br/>this country and the West
                    Indies, and perhaps from <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_167" n="173"></pb> the world. The curse is becoming
                    more intolerable<br/>to the man who is considered the wealthy owner
                    of<br/>slaves, than even the imagination of the opposers of<br/>slavery could
                    have pictured.</p>
<p>The great work of emancipation and colonization<br/>is going on with zeal and
                    success. Beside the Parent<br/>Colonization Society, fifteen State Colonization
                    Socie-<br/>ties have been formed, and more than two hundred<br/>and fifty
                    auxiliaries established. New associations<br/>are every day forming, to raise
                    the condition of the<br/>coloured free population; and these societies
                    greatly<br/>assist each other. These associations, formed for the<br/>purpose of
                    enlightening and benefiting the world,<br/>are the great moral engines by which
                    it is now and<br/>hereafter to be moved.</p>

<salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>As it may be proper for the Canal Company to<br/>make an application to
                            the legislature this winter, I<br/>think it would be right to be
                            prepared early. We <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_168" n="174"></pb>are in debt to the State
                                15,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. Many reasons may<br/>be urged to
                            induce the legislature to take so many of<br/>the unsubscribed shares,
                            as amount to that sum;<br/>they certainly would be more ready to do
                            this, than<br/> to relinquish a claim for the interest for four or
                            five<br/>years, as we proposed last winter. Whilst we are<br/>obliged to
                            pay 900<emph rend="italic">l</emph>., per year, interest on the
                            above<br/> debt out of the tolls, we will not be able to divide<br/>to
                            the stockholders more than two per cent, as a<br/>dividend. Perhaps some
                            other way may occur to<br/>thee to propose, for them to afford us
                            pecuniary aid.</p>
<p>The claims of the people at <geogname key="stillr">Still-Water</geogname>
                            are not<br/>yet satisfied. Suppose the directors were to lay a<br/>
                            requisition, payable <date when="1800-05-01">1st May</date> next, and
                            the stockhold-<br/>ers refuse to pay, the comptroller would pay for
                            the<br/> shares held by the state, the claimants might then be<br/>paid;
                            the corporation dissolved, and the whole stock<br/>of the Northern
                            Company belong only to the state.<br/>I take the liberty of sending
                            those hints, in hopes thou<br/>wilt be so good as to improve them, and
                            if it meets<br/>thy approbation, to draw a petition to the
                            legislature<br/>on behalf of the Western Company, containing
                            some-<br/>thing like what I have mentioned in the preceding<br/>part of
                            this letter, and a copy for the consideration<br/>of the Board, with
                            such further remarks as will occur,<br/>to be sent to the vice president
                            as soon as possible.<br/>Thou wilt excuse my anxiety to have, this
                            commu-<br/>nication early, as I expect to leave here for the
                            north,<br/>and soon after the assembly meets.</p>
<p>The attorney general says, he had a good deal of<br/>conversation with
                            thee, relative to the proposed law,<br/>to fix a punishment for small
                            offences, and for regu-<br/>lating county prisons. I beg to remind thee
                            of the<br/>plan I proposed, subject to thy improvement, viz. In<br/>each
                            county prison, to have as many rooms (or cells)<br/>made as is
                            convenient, six by eight feet. A single<br/>justice to sentence an
                            offender to be confined therein,<br/>from twenty-four hours, to ten
                            days. Three justices<br/>to sentence a criminal for thirty days, and the
                            Court <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_169" n="175"></pb>of Quarter Sessions, ninety days; all greater
                            offences,<br/>to be sent to the state prison for one or more
                            years.<br/>No intercourse to be allowed with untried prisoners,<br/>or
                            debtors, and a total prohibition to their wives, chil-<br/>dren,
                            friends, or any person whatever. Inspectors to<br/>visit the prison, at
                            least once every month, to examine<br/>into the conduct of the keeper,
                            who should have rules<br/>made by the inspectors, for his government.
                            The<br/>rooms should, by law, be directed to be white washed<br/>twice
                            every year, and no other than a low diet be allow-<br/>ed, and strictly
                            to prohibit any spirituous liquors. The<br/> inspectors might be
                            appointed by the county court,<br/>or supervisors, or by council of
                            appointment. Many<br/>of the jails at present are taverns; this should
                            be<br/>by law prevented. An allowance to the keeper<br/>sufficient to
                            procure a man of fair character should<br/>be paid out of the public
                            treasury. As our laws now<br/>are, the keeper, as he must have charge of
                            the debtors,<br/>must be appointed by the sheriff.</p>
<p>If what I have suggested meets thy approbation,<br/>I know thou wilt
                            considerably improve my plan; if<br/> so, and thou hast leisure to draw
                            a bill, it will much<br/>oblige me to be favoured with a copy.</p>
<p>Be pleased to accept my best wishes for thy health,<br/>and believe me
                            respectfully, and very truly,</p>

<salute>DEAR FRIEND.</salute></opener>
<p>During the inclemency of the weather this morn-<br/>ing, my mind has been
                            turned towards several absent<br/>Friends, and I determined to let them
                            know it; per-<br/>haps this may be the only sentiment worth
                            commu-<br/>nicating to thee; if it so turn out, thou mayest
                            credit<br/>me accordingly.</p>
<p>The peace which has been lately concluded between<br/>Great Britain and
                            this country, whilst it is a subject<br/>of general greeting and
                            rejoicing, will, I hope, impress <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_170" n="176"></pb> our minds with
                            thankfulness to him who is the<br/> author of every good and perfect
                            gift; and dispose<br/>us in future to harmonize more with each
                            other.<br/>That political trick and juggle, by which many
                            have<br/>contrived to direct the minds of the innocent and<br/> unwary,
                            brought us to a precipice, to which it is even<br/>now difficult to look
                            back without shuddering. If<br/>honesty of intention, and integrity of
                            conduct, were<br/>but the rule and practice of those appointed to
                            direct<br/>the affairs of the nation, I think, with the warning<br/>we
                            have had, we might long remain a separate and<br/>peaceful people; but
                            whether we are or shall soon<br/>become fit to receive, and capable of
                            enjoying, such<br/>blessings, is known only to him whose ways,
                            though<br/>past finding out, must be infinitely great and good,<br/>and
                            must have for their object the happiness of his<br/>creature, man.</p>
<p>Not only have I contemplated the subject, as to its<br/>general effect;
                            but also as to its effect on some of my<br/>personal friends. I have
                            anticipated the pleasure of<br/>hearing that it will effectually relieve
                            those in <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, who have been
                            threatened with pecuniary loss<br/>and embarrassment, by reason of the
                            failure of Min-<br/>turn and Champlin, and that they themselves
                            will<br/>be restored to a state of as much ease and affluence<br/>as
                            will do them good. I should be made glad by<br/>hearing from thee, to
                            this effect.</p>
<p>Another anticipation I have indulged in. That<br/>thyself and wife will
                            give us your company at the<br/>time of the next <a href="/organizations/nym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="nym"></orgname></a>. Nor do I mean to<br/>confine it to you
                            only, but such other of the family<br/>as may accompany you.</p>
<p>Present my Sally's love to <a href="/people/heddy1">Hannah<persname key="heddy1"></persname></a> and

                                thereof, on the subjects of such treatment,<br/>as well as their
                                effect on the general condition of<br/>society.</said></p>
<p>Since the establishment of this institution, many<br/>of its zealous and
                            benevolent founders have gone<br/>down to the grave. Some few, however,
                            continue<br/> actively interested in its concerns; who were
                            early<br/>engaged in those humane exertions, which, regardless<br/>of
                            the influence of prejudice, and the example of<br/>ages, aimed at the
                            accomplishment of a reformation<br/>in the penal jurisprudence of
                                <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>. With<br/>these are
                            now united others, who, from a conviction<br/>of the importance and
                            utility of those labours, as well<br/>as knowledge of the success of the
                            experiments<br/> which flowed from them, have been induced to
                            give<br/>their assistance to the same philanthropic cause.</p>
<p>To both these descriptions of our members it hath<br/>become an
                            interesting inquiry, what have been the<br/>effects produced in your
                            state by the adoption of a<br/>meliorated code of criminal laws?
                            Whether, allowing<br/>for the increase of population, since their
                            creation, crimes<br/>have diminished in their number, or degree of
                            enor-<br/>mity? Whether individuals, who, by their errors,<br/>have
                            unhappily been the subjects of your peniten-<br/>tiary system, are,

                            community? and, gene-<br/>rally, whether the moral condition of society
                            has<br/>been improved, and the security of its members pro-<br/>moted,
                            by the abolition of punishments, which were<br/>not less vindictive and
                            cruel, than was the employ-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_172" n="178"></pb>ment of them degrading to
                            the character of our spe-<br/>cies?</p>
<p>It is not only for our own satisfaction, that we are<br/>desirous of
                            obtaining whatever information you can<br/>furnish in relation to these
                            interesting subjects, but<br/>because we believe the combined experience
                            of all<br/>those who have been engaged in this great object of<br/>state
                            polity, cannot fail to advance its value in the<br/> estimation of

                            the cause of humanity.</p>
<p>We believe that, in our own country, the number<br/>of its friends is
                            gradually multiplying; and it is with<br/> peculiar satisfaction, we
                            have heard of the exertions<br/>which some benevolent individuals, in
                            their private<br/>capacity, as well as enlightened statesmen, in
                            their<br/>public character, are employing in Great Britain,
                            to<br/>render the laws of that kingdom less sanguinary.—<br/>These
                            advocates of reformation have had the candour<br/>to acknowledge, that

<p>Thy sentiments on crimes and punishments com-<br/>municated to the

                            the progress of an experiment<br/>making in this state, by adopting a
                            plan similar to<br/>the one formed, soon after the revolution, in
                                <a href="/places/penns">Pennsyl-vania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, for the

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_173" n="179"></pb>
<p>Some years ago, I was led to reflect on the state of<br/>the criminal
                            code in this state, and warmly impressed<br/>with the belief, that all
                            laws not founded on the<br/>principles of truth and justice, the common
                            feelings<br/>of humanity, and the rights of mankind, should
                            be<br/>repealed; I took a very decided and active part in
                            en-<br/>deavouring to obtain a repeal of our former system,
                            and<br/>establishing one more consistent with the pure prin-<br/>ciples
                            of Christianity. In <date when="1796">1796</date>, our laws were
                            altered,<br/>a state prison was directed to be built, and I was<br/>
                            appointed one of the board of inspectors. My zeal<br/>for promoting a
                            plan, which I conceived would tend<br/>to soften the dispositions of
                            those concerned in govern-<br/>ment, and thereby enlighten and prepare
                            their minds<br/> for still more improving the condition and state
                            of<br/>mankind, induced me to leave extensive mercantile<br/>pursuits,
                            and reside near the prison, about two miles<br/>from the city, in order
                            that I might strictly attend to<br/> its concerns. To reduce such a
                            description of men<br/>to a regular course of labour, decent behaviour,
                            and<br/>cleanliness, was a task that required unremitting<br/>attention,
                            and on the success of the scheme, depended<br/> whether society should
                            revive the former, or continue<br/>the new system. I was exceedingly
                            anxious that<br/>our prison should furnish a model for other states,
                            <br/>and have therefore attended, when in health, almost<br/>daily, to
                            superintend its concerns, and every winter<br/>for five years past,
                            visited <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, in order to promote
                            <br/>the passing of such laws or alterations of former<br/>ones, as were
                            deemed necessary, to perfect the pre-<br/>sent code. I have lately
                            published an account<br/>of the prison, for the information of the
                            public;<br/>and with a view to excite other states to follow
                            our<br/>example. I take the liberty now, to present thee<br/>with one of
                            those publications, which will give full<br/>information of the
                            management, economy, &amp;c. of the<br/>prison.</p>
<p>I understand there are some prisons in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>,<br/>where the convicts are employed at labour.
                            I should<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_174" n="180"></pb>be very glad to obtain information of the kind
                            of<br/>work carried on; if the product is sufficient to pay<br/>for
                            their support, clothing, &amp;c. I expect there are<br/>printed accounts
                            of them; and also some late books,<br/>or pamphlets, on crimes and
                            punishments, and on<br/> prisons. I therefore take the liberty to
                            request of<br/>thee, to be so obliging as to give my good friend,<br/>
<a href="/people/cwilk1">Charles Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a>, a memorandum of such
                            as in thy<br/>opinion may be worth my procuring. I should be<br/>very
                            glad to obtain the report of the Committee of<br/>the House of Commons,
                            on Bentley's plan; also, any<br/>or
                            all of his writings. I have <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>,
                            and the first<br/>edition of Police of <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> and Thames. If thou<br/>hast published any thing
                            lately, be pleased to insert<br/>it in the list. My friend <a href="/people/cwilk1">Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a> will take the trou-<br/>ble of
                            procuring from the booksellers, and forward-<br/>ing to me, such books
                            as thou wilt be so obliging as<br/>to recommend.</p>
<p>I enclose the last report of the inspectors of the<br/>state prison to
                            the legislature; they passed a law to<br/>build a prison, for solitary
                            confinement, on the plan<br/>recommended in the Report. I have often
                            thought<br/>that this would be an excellent plan in the city
                                of<br/><a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, for the punishment
                            of petty offences, and<br/>for preventing greater ones.</p>
<p>I am clearly of opinion, that <emph rend="italic">all</emph> prisons
                            intended<br/>for the confinement of convicts for a term of
                            years<br/>should be so constructed as that they should lodge
                            in<br/>separate rooms; by being kept thus solitary and sepa-<br/>rate
                            from each other, it would be more likely to<br/>produce reformation, and
                            prevent escapes.</p>
<p>There are in the prison 145 of the convicts employ-<br/>ed at shoemaking,
                            and that business has hitherto<br/>been carried on, by purchasing
                            leather, &amp;c., and dis-<br/>posing of the shoes and boots when
                            manufactured.<br/>As this required a considerable capital, and
                            was<br/>always attended with inconvenience, we have lately<br/>dropped
                            conducting the business in this mode, and<br/>have agreed with
                            shoemakers in the city, to take in<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_175" n="181"></pb>work at a fixed
                            price, for making each pair of shoes<br/>and hoots, according to the
                            size and quality—in this<br/>manner of employing those 145 men, they now
                            earn<br/> twelve hundred dollars per month, and it is now cer-<br/>tain,
                            that the labour performed by the prisoners will<br/>be more than
                            sufficient to support and clothe them,<br/>pay for bringing them from
                            the counties, and other<br/>incidental expenses.</p>
<p>I have hitherto acted as agent, but the system being<br/>now completed,
                            equal to my most sanguine expecta-<br/>tion, I intend this summer to
                            resign that situation.</p>

<salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p> Your very acceptable letter of the <date when="1802-06-06">6th
                                June</date>, accom-<br/>panied by your valuable and interesting
                            publication,<br/>giving an account of the State Penitentiary House
                            in<br/>the city of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, was
                            recently left, at my house<br/>in <a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, by <a href="/people/cwilk1">Mr.
                                Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a>, and has since been<br/>transmitted to me to the
                            country, to which I have<br/>retired for a short time, with a view to a
                            little<br/>relaxation from the labours attached to an arduous<br/>public
                            duty.</p>
<p> My temporary retirement has furnished me with<br/>an early opportunity
                            of perusing with attention, and<br/>also with much interest, your very
                            excellent state-<br/>ment of important and useful facts, and I
                            consider<br/> myself under infinite obligations to you, not only
                            for<br/>the knowledge of these facts, but for the acquaint-<br/>ance of
                            the worthy and respectable author, who has<br/>devoted so much time, and
                            made so many sacrifices,<br/>to promote the cause of humanity, and the
                            good of<br/>his fellow creatures.</p>
<p>It is a peculiar gratification to me, to have thus<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_176" n="182"></pb>
                            discovered that my literary productions have fallen<br/>under the
                            cognizance of one who is able, and also<br/>so thoroughly disposed, to
                            carry the principles they<br/>contain, on the subject of crimes and
                            punishments,<br/>into practice; and it is no small gratification to
                            me<br/>to find, that upon a subject so interesting to virtue<br/>and
                            humanity, our sentiments are completely in<br/>unison.</p>
<p>Your exertions, and those of your worthy colleagues,<br/>appears to have
                            done much for the State of <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and I entertain no doubt of the
                            sentiments of<br/>all the worthy and reflecting part of the
                            community<br/>being on your side in a short time; that the great<br/>and
                            good work, your unexampled perseverance has<br/>so happily accomplished,
                            will produce consequences<br/>which will not only bring conviction to
                            the minds of<br/>the most prejudiced, but also that you will live to
                            see<br/>and experience that reward, in the ultimate and<br/>complete
                            success of the design, which, to a mind like<br/>yours, must go far
                            beyond the praises and encomiums<br/>of the world. Your details are so
                            clear, so accurate<br/>and interesting, that they will be read with
                            avidity<br/>all over Europe.</p>
<p>To me it has been no small gratification, although<br/>I have, on account
                            of the war and other circumstan-<br/>ces, made as yet small progress in
                            the objects I have<br/> recommended to be adopted in this country, that
                            my<br/>writings have been translated into most of the<br/>languages in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, with a prospect of
                            general<br/> benefit to mankind, since, in all countries, the
                            vices<br/>and crimes of individuals are similar, and only differ<br/>as
                            to their extent.</p>
<p>I had read some years since, with the most heart-<br/>felt pleasure, two
                            different accounts of that most<br/>excellent institution, the
                            Penitentiary House in the<br/>city of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, which is the more valuable as<br/>it
                            furnishes an irrefragable proof to all <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, as<br/>well as America, that the great
                            desideratum has<br/> been accomplished, of rendering the labour of
                            crimi-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_177" n="183"></pb>nals productive, to a degree more than equal
                            to their<br/>maintenance, and what is of more importance,
                            of<br/>restoring them again to society with amended morals,<br/>and in a
                            situation to become useful instead of<br/>noxious members of the
                            community.</p>
<p>The criminal police is an object of the greatest im-<br/>portance in all
                            countries, but particularly in America,<br/>not only as a new country,
                            but as a Republic, ex-<br/>posed, from peculiar circumstances, to be
                            contami-<br/>nated by importations of the scum and outcasts of<br/>all
                            Europe. This, and other considerations, have<br/>excited great doubts in
                            my mind, whether the intro-<br/>duction of Europeans in the present
                            state of the popu-<br/>lation of America, is not, upon the whole,
                            injurious.<br/>This is exemplified in no inconsiderable degree
                            in<br/>the comparative view you have given of the coun-<br/>tries to
                            which the different classes of convicts belong.<br/>It might be
                            difficult and invidious to exclude the<br/>white people of Europe, and
                            might be a reflection<br/>upon the national character; but, surely, this
                            policy<br/>does not apply to the negroes of the West Indies,<br/>who, I
                            perceive, tend, in no inconsiderable degree,<br/>to increase the
                            calendars of delinquency.</p>
<p>You have been rightly informed, that several very<br/> expensive Houses
                            of Correction have been estab-<br/>lished in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, within the last twenty years,<br/>under the
                            authority of acts of Parliament, the out-<br/>lines of which I have laid
                            before the public; but<br/>although the expense has been excessive, (in
                            one in-<br/>stance 80,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. sterling,) I am
                            sorry to say, that, how-<br/>ever excellent the theory, by a fatality
                            which is not<br/>easy to be explained, no results that can be held
                            out<br/>as an example, can be exhibited. In one or two,
                            in<br/>particular, <emph rend="italic"><a href="/places/oxfor">Oxford<placename key="oxfor"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/glouc1">Gloster<placename key="glouc1"></placename></a></emph>, where, (like the Peni-<br/>tentiary
                            House at <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>) some benevolent
                            cha-<br/>racters have devoted much time and attention to the<br/>economy
                            of the establishments, the labour of the con-<br/>victs has been
                            rendered, in a certain degree produc-<br/>tive.—We have a superb
                            establishment in <a href="/places/midse">Middlesex<placename key="midse"></placename></a>,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_178" n="184"></pb>to which I bestowed much attention at the outset,<br/>but,
                            instead of being seconded, I found myself coun-<br/>teracted in all my
                            anxious cares to introduce a sys-<br/>tem of useful and productive
                            labour, and I lament to<br/>say, that, in addition to fourscore thousand
                            pounds<br/>laid out in the buildings, it costs the county
                                nearly<br/>4000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. sterling a year, to
                            maintain the prisoners.—<br/>Contemplating the difficulties and the
                            consequent<br/>failure of most of the plans founded on <a href="/people/jhowa1">Mr. Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>'s<br/>ideas, and considering the
                            obstructions which are<br/>opposed to evils, in their nature so
                            gigantic, I have<br/>been induced to give a decided preference to
                                <a href="/people/jbent2">Mr.Bentham<persname key="jbent2"></persname></a>'s plan, as briefly
                            explained in my treatise<br/>on the police, (6th edition) where he
                            proposes to<br/>enter into a contract for the labour of convicts,
                            and<br/>to become responsible for the reformation of their<br/>manners
                            and vices.—When I return to <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, I
                            will<br/>procure from that gentleman a copy of the detail of<br/>his
                            plan and will have great pleasure in transmit-<br/>ting it to you, with
                            such other publications as apply<br/>to the subject of Penitentiary
                            Houses. I will also send,<br/>if I can possibly procure it, a copy of a
                            report of the<br/>Committee of the House of Commons.—The whole<br/>of
                            the reports have been reprinted in four volumes,<br/>among which
                            twenty-eight treats of Police. They<br/>are all extremely interesting,
                            and, I think, you will<br/>be desirous that they should have a place in
                            your<br/>library; when I have the pleasure of seeing <a href="/people/cwilk1">Mr.Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a>, I will consult with him how
                            far I should go<br/>in this respect. The first edition of the police of<br/>
<a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> may be considered as only an
                                <emph rend="italic">imperfect sketch</emph>.<br/>It is in the
                            sixth-edition of that work that you will<br/>find those interesting
                            topics discussed, to which your<br/>attention is at present so laudably
                            directed.</p>
<p>The last report of your committee is extremely<br/>interesting, and you
                            press upon the attention of the<br/>legislature, with great propriety,
                            the evils arising<br/>from the excessive multiplication of <emph rend="italic">spirit houses</emph>, and<br/><emph rend="italic">public houses</emph>. Nothing tends so much to the corrup-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_179" n="185"></pb>tion of morals, or to promote habits of idleness,
                            ulti-<br/>mately generating crimes: 1200 of these receptacles<br/>of
                            vice in so small a city as <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,
                            are to be con-<br/>sidered as an evil of the greatest magnitude. In
                            the<br/> metropolis of the British Empire, which contains<br/>twelve
                            times the number of inhabitants, the magis-<br/>trates do not grant
                            licences to more than about 4000,<br/>although, taking in the towns and
                            villages in the<br/>vicinity, we have upwards of 5000 in the whole.
                            I<br/>have been at great pains, in forming and enforcing<br/>rules and
                            orders for the proper regulation of publi-<br/>cans, in different
                            districts of the metropolis, where I<br/>have acted as a magistrate—a
                            copy of which I will<br/>send you. The indiscriminate mixture of young
                            and<br/>old offenders, in the same prison, I observe, is men-<br/>tioned
                            with great propriety in your last report. I<br/>have always considered
                            this practice (which also<br/>prevails here) as one of the greatest
                            nurseries of<br/>crimes; and I am glad to find you have brought it<br/>
                            under the review of your legislature. The remedy<br/>you propose,
                            appears to me to be the wisest and most<br/>effectual that can be
                            devised.</p>
<p>Your proposition to authorize the police magis-<br/>trates to try, in a
                            summary way, all persons committing<br/>minor offences, such as petty
                            assaults, drunkenness,<br/>and acts of vagrancy, &amp;c., will prove a
                            great relief to<br/> juries, and will tend much to the diminution
                            of<br/>crimes. In this country, the legislature finds it<br/>necessary
                            every session, to extend the summary<br/> jurisdiction of magistrates;
                            and experience has shown,<br/>(as these magistrates are responsible,)
                            that instead of<br/>abridging, it extends the liberty of the innocent
                            part<br/>of the community; and I can safely affirm, that had<br/>it not
                            been for these summary jurisdictions, it would<br/>have been impossible,
                            in any degree, to have kept<br/>the vices and crimes of the people
                            within any mode-<br/>rate bounds. The present state of society and
                            morals,<br/>in <emph rend="italic">what is called the civilized
                                world</emph>, render a species<br/>of energy necessary, which can
                            only be attained by<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_180" n="186"></pb>summary proceedings. The great
                            inlets to vice,<br/>idleness, and crimes, are, <emph rend="italic">ill
                                regulated public houses,<br/> gaming, horse-racing, cock-fighting,
                                profane swearing</emph>,<br/>and <emph rend="italic">a contempt of
                                religious duties on a Sunday</emph>: to<br/>which may be added,
                            generally, every species of dis-<br/>sipation, which has a tendency to
                            congregate multi-<br/>tudes of people on the same spot. In a new
                            country<br/>like America, where the general prosperity of the<br/>nation
                            depends, in so eminent a degree, on the morals<br/>of the people, the
                            legislature cannot promote the true<br/>welfare of the state, in a
                            greater degree, than by<br/> authorizing magistrates to correct these
                            evils, by<br/>inflicting mild punishments in a summary way, and<br/>by
                            commuting, in various instances that will occur,<br/>the punishment of
                                <emph rend="italic">imprisonment</emph> by <emph rend="italic">pecuniary penal-<br/>ties</emph>, to be applied to the expenses of
                            the police.<br/>Female prostitution, particularly in the cities
                            in<br/>America, also requires appropriate laws, which will<br/>apply to
                            both sexes; and those should be adminis-<br/>tered in a summary way by
                            the magistrates, by<br/><emph rend="italic">imprisonment</emph>, or
                                <emph rend="italic">mild pecuniary fines</emph>. In like
                            man-<br/>ner, brothels ought not to be prosecuted by the tedious<br/>and
                            circuitous process of indictment and trial by<br/>jury. The expense of
                            such prosecutions in this<br/>country, tend much to the increase of the
                            evils of<br/>prostitution, while, through the medium of the
                            chi-<br/>cane of the law, many notorious delinquents
                            escape<br/>justice.</p>
<p>I could not have conceived, until I perused your<br/>accurate reports,
                            that such a number of larcenies<br/>could have been committed in the
                            city of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.<br/>It is
                            impossible that depredations to such an extent<br/>should be committed,
                            unless there were many <emph rend="italic">receiv-<br/>ers of stolen
                                goods</emph>; such as <emph rend="italic">purchasers of old
                                metals</emph>,<br/><emph rend="italic">old apparel, ships stores,
                                rags, and hand stuff &amp;c.</emph><br/>These classes of dealers
                            require the watchful eye of<br/>the legislature, and much advantage
                            would be derived,<br/>from restraining them from dealing, unless under
                            the<br/> authority of a licence, with power to the magistrates<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_181" n="187"></pb>to withhold it on the succeeding year, in case of any<br/>
                            information of improper conduct, and to forfeit it,<br/>in case of
                            conviction—a power also to constables, to<br/>stop and examine the
                            persons who convey parcels,<br/>&amp;c. after dark, and to punish the
                            offenders if they<br/> cannot give a satisfactory account to the
                            magistrate,<br/>how they obtained the same, would tend much to<br/>the
                            prevention of crimes. It is by these precau-<br/>tions, and by mild
                            summary punishments, that the<br/>calendars of delinquency are to be
                            diminished in<br/>every country, and a wise legislature will look
                                to<br/><emph rend="italic">prevention as a primary object</emph>,
                            that there may be<br/>occasion as seldom as possible, to resort to
                            punish-<br/>ment.</p>
<p>As temperance operates powerfully in preventing<br/>diseases in the human
                            body, so will preventives tend<br/>to diminish the evils in the body
                            politic. In America,<br/>where old prejudices do not exist, and where
                            the<br/>laws in their progress are verging towards maturity,<br/>this
                            preventive system can be much easier accom<br/>plished than in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, and if the legislature is
                            true<br/>to itself, it will see the vast importance of
                            establish-<br/>ing, in the first instance, every safe-guard to
                            the<br/>innocent part of the community, by shutting up, as<br/>far as
                            circumstances will permit, <emph rend="italic">every avenue to<br/>
                                crimes</emph>. The true interests of the state requires it,<br/>and
                            humanity to the unhappy individuals, who are<br/>tempted to perpetrate
                            offences, from the temptations<br/>which assail them, plead strongly for
                            the adoption of<br/>an appropriate preventive system, applicable to
                            the<br/>local and peculiar state of the country.</p>
<p>Did I not know that I was addressing myself to a<br/>man of true
                            philanthropy, who glories in his country's<br/> prosperity, and

<salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>Your excellent work on the state prison of <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, has been considered of so much interest
                            and<br/>importance, by several very elevated characters in
                            this<br/>country, that a proposition has been made to reprint<br/>it. It
                            is now in the hands of the members for the<br/>Home Department, through
                            whose medium, I trust,<br/> and ardently hope, it may be rendered useful
                            in this<br/>country. According to your desire, I have occasion-<br/>ally
                            been employed, for some time past, in collecting<br/>every publication
                            which appears to me to bear on<br/>subjects of this nature, as well as
                            on other topics of<br/>political economy, which have appeared to me to
                            be<br/>analogous. The whole are sent in a box addressed<br/>to you, by
                            this opportunity, in conformity to a list<br/> now inclosed; and I have
                            particularly to request that<br/>you will accept of them from me, as a
                            mark of my<br/> esteem and regard.</p>
<p>You will trace in these various tracts a very great<br/>portion of zeal
                            and genuine philanthropy, as well as<br/>strong marks of extensive
                            reading and profound<br/>knowledge, on subjects calculated to promote
                            the com-<br/>fort and happiness of society, in every part of
                            the<br/>civilized world.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_183" n="189"></pb>
<p>The first object to be attended to, with a view to<br/>the comfort,
                            happiness, and security of a nation, is a<br/>proper provision for the
                            education of youth. <q><emph rend="italic">That<br/>country is the
                                    happiest</emph>, (says a great writer,) <emph rend="italic">where there<br/>is the most virtue</emph>.</q> To suffer
                            the youth of both sexes<br/>to be ill educated, and to be reared to
                            maturity with-<br/>out a proper sense of religion and virtue, and
                            an<br/> abhorrence of vice, is to establish a nursery
                            for<br/>crimes.</p>
<p>In a new country like America, where the popula-<br/>tion increases so
                            fast, it becomes an important deside-<br/>ratum, that the means and
                            facilities to obtain a<br/>virtuous and proper education, should keep
                            pace with<br/>the constant increase of the youth of both
                            sexes.<br/>Where national institutions of this nature have
                            been<br/>established in Scotland and in Switzerland, the hap-<br/>piest
                            effects have been produced. On the contrary,<br/> where this great
                            measure of state policy has been<br/>neglected, the manners of the
                            people have exhibited<br/>strong instances of a deficiency, manifested
                            by<br/>extreme ignorance and immoral conduct, as it respects<br/>a
                            considerable proportion of the lower classes of<br/>society; and hence
                            it is that crimes multiply, and<br/>that the adult becomes often
                            enervated and useless to<br/>society at that period of life, when labour
                            ought to<br/>be most productive.</p>
<p>Upon the subject of education, the reports which I<br/>have transmitted,
                            published by the society for better-<br/>ing the condition of the poor,
                            furnish many excellent<br/>hints and suggestions.</p>
<p>The next object, as it relates to criminal offences,<br/>and which is of
                            the highest importance to civil<br/>society, is a proper attention to
                            those, whose indi-<br/>gence or idleness render them burdens upon
                            the<br/>other classes of society. This evil becomes a hydra<br/>in every
                            nation, where appropriate regulations do not<br/>exist for educating the
                            offspring of indigent and<br/> profligate parents, or orphans who are
                            cast upon the<br/>public; and also for propping up adults, reduced to
                            a<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_184" n="190"></pb>state of extreme poverty and wretchedness, so as
                            to<br/>compel them, at least to the extent of their abilities,<br/>to
                            assist themselves. The want of appropriate regu-<br/>lations, under an
                            accurate and correct management,<br/>as it applies to this very
                            difficult branch of political<br/>economy, is one of the chief causes of
                            the numerous<br/>criminal offences which afflict society in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.<br/>It is one of the greatest
                            nurseries of crimes, from which<br/>you are already not exempted in the
                            larger societies<br/>in America, perhaps from this scene of
                            turpitude;<br/>this <emph rend="italic">gangrene</emph>, not having as
                            yet sufficiently attracted<br/>the notice of your government.</p>
<p>Upon this important branch of political economy,<br/>much useful
                            information will be found in the reports<br/>of the society of the poor,
                            exhibiting a vast scope for<br/>the exertion both of public and private
                            benevolence,<br/>particularly the latter; as it respects the former,
                            the<br/>preliminary sketches on the poor, by <a href="/people/jbent2">Jeremy Bentham<persname key="jbent2"></persname></a>,<br/>Esq., furnish much curious and
                            important matter,<br/>which will be read with great interest by the
                            philo-<br/>sopher, the statesman, and the philanthropist.</p>
<p>Periods of scarcity are not so likely to happen in<br/>America as in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>: yet as the food of man
                            rises<br/>to an enormous price in the United States, as often<br/>as
                            extraordinary demands are made upon you, the<br/>condition of your poor,
                            in the large cities, must, in a<br/>certain degree, claim the occasional
                            attention of the<br/>benevolent; and therefore, as it may be interesting
                            to<br/> know what has been accomplished in this country,<br/>and
                            particularly in this great metropolis, during the<br/>recent periods of
                            scarcity, I have taken the liberty<br/>to send you several tracts, and
                            other papers, upon this<br/>subject, which have been chiefly compiled by
                            myself<br/>for the use of the public, and the various societies<br/>with
                            which I was connected, where I generally had<br/>the labouring oar.
                            These papers are the more inte-<br/>resting, as they tend to prove how
                            much may be<br/>gained by an economizing system, and at how small<br/>an
                            expense, under proper management, it is possible<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_185" n="191"></pb>to
                            feed and to prop up families in distress. The<br/>attention and labour
                            are indeed excessive; and the<br/>reward to the numerous benevolent
                                individuals*<br/><note rend="asterisk">On this interesting occasion,
                                the public were under infinite obligations to<br/> the <orgname key="lym">Society of Friends resident in <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a></orgname>; without their assistance
                                and<br/> steady perseverance, we could not have accomplished the
                                relief which was<br/> afforded.</note> who<br/>came forward on this
                            occasion, was felt to be com-<br/>plete, since it produced the wished
                            for effect.</p>
<p>On other effects immediately connected with objects<br/>of beneficence, I
                            beg leave to refer you to <a href="/people/jlett1">Doctor
                                Lettsom<persname key="jlett1"></persname></a>'s recent work, which I also send you, <emph rend="italic">by his<br/> particular desire</emph>, in which you
                            will find much useful<br/>and interesting information, calculated to
                            improve<br/> the state of civil society, as it relates to the
                            poor,<br/>and to analogous distempers, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the
                            last<br/>subject, namely, analogous fevers, and particularly<br/>the
                            typhus or jail distemper, you will find some<br/>new and interesting
                            information, in a tract detailing<br/>a variety of successful
                            experiments, which has been<br/>published and circulated by the society
                            for bettering<br/>the condition of the poor, by which it appears
                            emer-<br/>sion in water, or the shower bath, is a certain cure.</p>
<p>Turning from this subject, to that which relates to<br/>the preservation
                            of morals, and the prevention of<br/>criminal offences, I must refer you
                            to my observations<br/>on public houses, (of which I send you two
                            copies,)<br/>and also my treatise, recently published, on the
                            duty<br/>of a constable. The first will furnish some useful<br/>hints
                            relative to regulations which, ere long, will be<br/>found necessary in
                            America, (particularly in the large<br/>towns,) with respect to dram
                            shops, and the excessive<br/>and unrestrained use of spirituous liquors,
                            than which,<br/>when indulged in to excess, nothing can be
                            more<br/>pernicious, both to the health and morals of the<br/>labouring
                            people. It is the chief source of the multi-<br/>plication of crimes,
                            which afflict society in the city<br/>of <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>;—to which I might add, those persons<br/>who
                            are permitted, without control or inspection, to<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_186" n="192"></pb>deal
                            in <emph rend="italic">old metals, old ships stores, and apparel
                                and<br/>furniture bought at second hand</emph>. The first,
                            namely,<br/>dram shops, corrupt the morals; while the second,
                            by<br/>holding out facilities to thieves, by purchasing what-<br/>ever
                            may be offered for sale, without asking questions,<br/>and that too at
                            an under price, become the fosterers of<br/>crimes.</p>
<p>In the tract on constables, you will see, under<br/> various heads, what
                            provisions our laws have made<br/>for the prevention of the corruption
                            of morals, and<br/>the commission of crimes. By the adoption of
                            the<br/>farther regulations recommended in my treatise on<br/>the police
                            of the metropolis, and also by the select<br/>committee of the House of
                            Commons, much might be<br/>done in this country to diminish the number
                            of<br/> offenders of all descriptions. Not being able to pro-<br/>cure a
                            copy of this very interesting report in a separate<br/>volume, an
                            opportunity is afforded me of requesting<br/>your acceptance of the
                            whole of the interesting reports<br/> of the select committee on
                            finance, from which the<br/>statesman, the politician, the financier,
                            and the poli-<br/>tical economist, will be able to acquire much
                            useful<br/>information, highly beneficial to America. The<br/>
                            twenty-eighth report in the second volume, treats on<br/>the <emph rend="italic">general police</emph>, where, on this subject, you
                            will find<br/>details highly interesting, as they relate to the
                            mea-<br/>sures proposed for the prevention of crimes, and
                            the<br/>punishment of offenders.</p>
<p> On the subject of penitentiary punishment, I send<br/>you <a href="/people/jbent2">Mr. Bentham<persname key="jbent2"></persname></a>'s two volumes, explaining the
                            con-<br/>struction and general currency of his Ponoplicon; also,<br/>a
                            parcel containing the annual reports of the peni-<br/>tentiary house in
                            Dorsetshire, with other papers<br/>delivered to me by that distinguished
                            senator, <a href="/people/wpitt1">William Morton Pitt<persname key="wpitt1"></persname></a>,
                            Esq., member of Parliament for the county<br/>of Dorset, to whose
                            indefatigable attention this estab-<br/>lishment owes its superiority
                            over every similar<br/>institution m this country. <a href="/people/wpitt1">Mr. Morton Pitt<persname key="wpitt1"></persname></a> has been<br/>much fascinated
                            by your work, and as I have already<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_187" n="193"></pb>mentioned, is
                            anxious it should be reprinted in <a href="/places/engl">Eng-land<placename key="engl"></placename></a>; but as this desideratum may not be
                            attained, it<br/>would be very gratifying if I could have it in my<br/>
                            power to present to the Speaker of the House of<br/>Commons, to him, and
                            to some other distinguished<br/>characters in this country, a copy of
                            the work. I<br/>have inquired at different booksellers, and also
                                of<br/><a href="/people/cwilk1">Mr. Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a>, but I do not
                            find that it is to be pur-<br/>chased.</p>
<p>On the subject of prisons in this country, I have<br/>only farther to
                            call your attention to a work just<br/> published by <a href="/people/jniel1">James Nield<persname key="jniel1"></persname></a>, Esq., who, following the<br/>
                            example of the great, the benevolent <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>, em-<br/>ploys an easy fortune, and much of his
                            time, in visit-<br/>ing the different prisons in Great Britain. His
                            chief<br/> attention, however, has been directed to the situation<br/>of
                            poor persons confined for civil debts, to whom, as<br/>you will observe
                            from his work, and also from his<br/>exertions as treasurer of the
                            society, he has been <emph rend="italic">a<br/> friend
                            indeed</emph>.</p>
<p>On the subject of punishments, I send you inclosed<br/>the last statement
                            of the delivery of the gaol at <a href="/places/newga">New-
                                gate<placename key="newga"></placename></a>, which has been recently sent me by the
                            Secre-<br/>tary of State, and contains a general view of
                            the<br/>disposal of prisoners for the last year, for the
                            more<br/>aggravated offences tried at the Court of Oyer and<br/>Terminer
                            at the Old Bailey. In this statement, how-<br/>ever, neither the
                            numerous persons tried at the <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>,<br/>
<a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/midse">Middlesex<placename key="midse"></placename></a> Sessions, nor at the<br/>Assizes
                            and Sessions in <a href="/places/souwa">Southwark<placename key="souwa"></placename></a>, which
                            makes a<br/>part of the metropolis, are included. I have no<br/>means at
                            present of ascertaining the amount of these;<br/>but I have reason to
                            believe they are equal, or per-<br/>haps exceed, the number stated in
                            the last (sixth<br/>edition) of the treatise on the police.</p>
<p>The only use which can be made of this melan-<br/>choly catalogue of
                            depravity, is to stimulate those in<br/>power, in every country, to the
                            adoption of such<br/>measures, as shall forewarn the unwary, arrest
                            the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_188" n="194"></pb>hands of evil doers, and thereby lessen the
                            demand<br/>for punishment. To you, sir, and to many other<br/>benevolent
                            characters, the United States are under<br/> great obligations; but your
                            labours are not yet<br/>terminated. Since by punishment alone, we are
                            not<br/>to look for that amelioration in the state of society,<br/>which
                            is to arise from the diminution of crimes,<br/>the minds of your chief
                            magistrates and active<br/>senators, ought ever to be alive to the means
                            of<br/>prevention. To those who are likely to commit<br/>offences, there
                            cannot be a greater act of humanity;<br/>while on society at large, a
                            greater benefit cannot be<br/>conferred. It is not the mere loss of
                            property that<br/>is to be deplored. In the ramifications of vice
                            extend-<br/>ed broad and wide, a nation bleeds at every pore in<br/>that
                            general contamination, which poisons the mind,<br/>renders the corporeal
                            functions useless, and abridges<br/> that industry and exertion in
                            beneficial labour, which<br/>constitutes the support of every state and
                            body<br/>politic.</p>
<p>It is not enough to frame excellent laws to punish<br/>delinquents. The
                            history of all civilized countries,<br/>has proved how inefficacious
                            they are in the improve-<br/>ment of morals. With every attention which
                            human<br/>wisdom can bestow, where multitudes are congre-<br/>gated
                            together in gaols, who have long been apostates<br/>from virtue, vice
                            must in general be triumphant.<br/>As you advance in population, under
                            the unavoidable<br/>hazard of contamination by frequent
                            importations<br/>of depraved characters, who have fled, in many<br/>
                            instances, from the punishment due to their crimes<br/>in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, a vigilant and active preventive
                            police<br/>becomes necessary. Nor should a free country com-<br/>plain
                            of such a system, since crimes and criminal<br/>people constantly
                            abridge the privileges of innocence.<br/>Restraints which attach only to
                            evil doers, can never<br/>disturb the proceedings of the peaceful
                            citizen in the<br/>general intercourse of society. Let the American<br/>
                            government, before it becomes too unwieldy, guard<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_189" n="195"></pb>the
                            morals of its people as its best prop. What may<br/>be found easy and
                            practicable in the yet infant state<br/>of society, may become
                            difficult, and perhaps impossi-<br/>ble, when evil habits descend from
                            generation to<br/> generation, until at length it becomes too gigantic
                            for<br/>human exertion. Comparatively speaking, the country<br/>is yet
                            virtuous. To permit it to retrograde, as it<br/>becomes more wealthy and
                            more populous, by an<br/> inattention to the general progress of evil
                            habits,<br/>would be to entail upon posterity an excessive<br/>calamity.
                            The task is certainly not difficult at<br/>present, since in the country
                            there is little to fear, and<br/> hence it would seem, that the energy
                            of police would<br/>only be necessary in the great towns, checking
                            and<br/>restraining those propensities, which lead to the
                            cor-<br/>ruption of morals. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that<br/>an
                            indulgence in many propensities, which half a<br/>century ago were
                            divested of their evil consequences,<br/>from the then infant state of
                            society, became noxious<br/>as population increases. It is then <emph rend="italic">drunkenness,<br/>gaming, lewdness</emph>, and other
                            offences, leading to the<br/>corruption of morals, acquire their sting.
                            They pro-<br/>mote idleness; while want of employment, where<br/>labour
                            is necessary for subsistence, is the never failing<br/>inroad to
                            crimes.</p>
<p>I am induced to enlarge upon this subject, from<br/>the facts you have
                            disclosed, relative to the criminal<br/>offences committed in the city
                            of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. They<br/>appear to me to
                            be of a magnitude to excite a con-<br/>siderable degree of alarm with
                            respect to the increase<br/>of criminality in the American towns;
                            inasmuch as<br/>it would appear that they greatly exceed the number<br/>
                            of larcenies and misdemeanours, committed in towns<br/>in Great Britain,
                            of an equal or even a greater popu-<br/>lation; and although I have not
                            had an opportunity<br/>of ascertaining the fact, I have an impression on
                            my<br/>mind, that the annual convictions in the whole of<br/>Scotland,
                            where the population approaches two<br/>millions of people, are short of
                            those which take<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_190" n="196"></pb>place yearly in the state of
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>; and yet
                            that<br/>country, from the rapid influx of riches and luxury,<br/>and
                            extensive manufactures, cannot be said to be<br/>improving in morals. I
                            fear the reverse is the case;<br/>since I have been recently applied to
                            by some of the<br/>first public characters in that country, to
                            suggest<br/>means for the improvement of their police.
                            Arrange-<br/>ments and checks upon evil propensities, must be<br/>
                            accommodated gradually to the existing state of<br/>society. The
                            intention of all governments is to render<br/>human nature as perfect as
                            possible, since from this<br/>perfection results the security and the
                            comfort of the<br/> whole; but errors and imperfections incident
                            to<br/>human nature are unfavourable, and ever will be so,<br/>to such a
                            state of things, which can only be main-<br/>tained by good and
                            appropriate laws, wisely and<br/>prudently administered.</p>
<p>If the information I have transmitted, or what I<br/>have communicated in
                            this and my former letter,<br/>(which I hope you have received,) can be
                            of use in<br/>promoting any of your benevolent objects for
                            the<br/>benefit of your country, it will afford me the
                            sincerest<br/>pleasure.</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Almost immediately after receiving thy esteemed<br/>favour, of the <date when="1803-02-10">10th February</date> last, business called
                            me<br/>from the city, from which I have been absent several<br/>weeks.
                            This must be my apology for not sooner<br/>replying to thy letter.
                            During my absence, I have<br/>been to <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and have made some
                            inquiries<br/>concerning the matters to which thou hast requested<br/>
                            my attention.</p>
<p>It would afford me very sincere pleasure to be of<br/>service to one, for
                            whom, though personally un-<br/>known, I cherish the highest respect and
                            esteem, and<br/>whose benevolent and active exertions, to
                            diminish<br/>the evils of civil society, claims the gratitude of
                            every<br/> citizen of the world.</p>
<p>In consenting to take upon me the agency of thy<br/> lands here, it is
                            proper for me to state, that, having<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_193" n="199"></pb>devoted the last
                            seven years wholly to the promotion<br/>of a favourite object, the
                            amelioration of the penal<br/>laws, and the establishment of a
                            penitentiary house<br/>in this state, I have been prevented from
                            bestowing<br/>the necessary attention to my private affairs.</p>
<p>This object, which I have had so much at heart,<br/>being now so far
                            accomplished, and put into a train<br/>of successful experiment, as to
                            permit me to with-<br/>draw from that close application which has
                            been<br/>hitherto requisite, I shall have leisure to attend to<br/>other
                            things.</p>
<p>Some property which I have in <a href="/places/vermo">Vermont<placename key="vermo"></placename></a>,
                            and <a href="/places/penns">Penn-sylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, will demand
                            my earliest regard. Not in-<br/>tending to return again to mercantile
                            pursuits, I<br/>mean to give some portion of the remainder of
                            my<br/>life (as Providence may spare it) to the service of
                            the<br/>poorer classes of society.—It would not, therefore,
                            be<br/>agreeable to have any considerable obstacle inter-<br/>posed,
                            which may impede the course I wish to pur-<br/>sue.—But the scheme of
                            action I have proposed to<br/>myself, will not prevent my using every
                            exertion to<br/>promote thy interests, and to fulfil thy wishes.</p>
<p>In whatever I do for thee, I beg to be clearly under-<br/>stood, as
                            disclaiming every pecuniary compensation,<br/>beyond the actual and
                            necessary expense attending<br/>the transactions; but I may find it for
                            thy interest,<br/>and my own satisfaction, to use the advice and
                            assist-<br/>ance of my particular and valuable friend, <a href="/people/wjohn2">WilliamJohnson<persname key="wjohn2"></persname></a>, Esquire, of this city,
                            whose disposition will<br/>prompt him to feel an equal and lively
                            interest in<br/>whatever concerns thee, as he has read thy
                            works<br/>with singular avidity and pleasure, and has conceived<br/>the
                            highest respect for thee; and if he can be induced<br/>to accept it, I
                            should cheerfully relinquish to him<br/>every compensation which thee
                            may feel disposed,<br/>in the result of the business to bestow.—I should
                            pre-<br/>fer, if it meets thy approbation, to have his name
                            in-<br/>serted with mine, in thy power of attorney, as from<br/> my
                            intimacy with him, founded on a clear knowledge<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_194" n="200"></pb>of his
                            integrity, his philanthropy, and excellent<br/>talents, that it would
                            decidedly be to thy interest and<br/>advantage.</p>
<p>I intend to send this letter by the Juliana, <a href="/people/cbrow1">CaptainBrown<persname key="cbrow1"></persname></a>, and shall deliver to his care a small
                            box,<br/>(marked <a href="/people/pcolq1">Patrick Colquhoun<persname key="pcolq1"></persname></a>,

                            twelve copies of the Account of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a><br/> State Prison, and an equal number of the

                            for thyself,<br/>and other friends.</p>
<p>I have not yet time to read all the books which<br/>thou sent me; but
                            intend to do so very soon, and<br/>shall write to <a href="/people/wpitt1">William M. Pitt<persname key="wpitt1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/jbent2">Jeremy

                            in my next<br/>I shall speak to thee on the subjects mentioned in
                            thy<br/>most valuable interesting letters, received in answer<br/>to
                            mine, by <a href="/people/cwilk1">Charles Wilkes<persname key="cwilk1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>Should an edition of the work, I have sent, be<br/>printed in London, it
                            would add much to its value, if<br/>the last report (now sent) was
                            printed with the ap-<br/>pendix, as it contains results more flattering
                            than<br/>those of any former; some preliminary remarks, by<br/>thyself,
                            or <a href="/people/jbent2">Jeremy Bentham<persname key="jbent2"></persname></a>, would stamp a
                            greater<br/>value on the work, and give it a wider circulation.</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of<br/>thy very acceptable
                            and instructive letter, of <date when="1803-02-16">16th<br/>February</date>, and to request thee to accept my
                            sincere<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_195" n="201"></pb>thanks for the information it contains;
                            and, particu-<br/>larly, for the truly valuable and interesting
                            collection<br/>of books and pamphlets, with which it was
                            accom-<br/>panied. These productions display, in a most stri-<br/>king
                            manner, the zeal of the English nation (distin-<br/>guished above all
                            others for its extensive practice of<br/>Christian charity) in the great
                            cause of benevolence<br/>and humanity. The perusal of them will
                            furnish<br/>many valuable hints to myself and others, in this<br/>
                            country, and animate us to follow the illustrious<br/>example which you
                            have set before us. Happy for<br/>us, many of the evils which afflict
                            and deform the<br/>more populous societies in Europe, either do not
                            exist<br/>among us, or only appear in a small degree. This<br/>exemption
                            is the result of the peculiar state of the<br/>country, where the wants
                            of men are easily supplied,<br/>the incentives to industry and
                            enterprise numerous<br/>and powerful, and temptations to vice
                            comparatively<br/>few. Thy excellent remarks, however, on
                            public<br/>education, and the preventive system of police,
                            are<br/>applicable to America, as well as every other nation;<br/>and I
                            have thought them of so much importance,<br/>and so likely to do good,
                            that I have taken the liberty<br/>to make thy letter public; coming from
                            one so dis-<br/>tinguished for his knowledge on the subjects,
                            and<br/>whose character and station claims the highest re-<br/>spect,
                            they will have much greater weight than any<br/>thing that could be said
                            by one of our own citizens.<br/>I trust the motives which have actuated
                            me, will be<br/>a sufficient apology for the freedom I have taken
                            in<br/>giving thy letter to the world.</p>
<p>Your society for bettering the condition of the poor,<br/>is a most
                            excellent institution, and cannot fail to pro-<br/>duce the most happy
                            effect. This, and similar asso-<br/>ciations, reflect the highest honour
                            on your country.<br/> The immense sums bestowed in charity, and
                            the<br/>active exertions of so many enlightened and digni-<br/>fied
                            characters, in works of benevolence, is indeed<br/>without example. If
                            the good produced be, in any<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_196" n="202"></pb>degree, proportionate to
                            the extent of the means em-<br/>ployed, much misery must be prevented,
                            and many<br/>evils be exterminated. Your efforts in establishing a<br/>
                            preventive system, and in diffusing a knowledge of<br/>the means of
                            self-correction to the lower classes of<br/>society, are the wisest that
                            can be imagined; you<br/>strike at once at the root of the tree of evil,
                            instead<br/> of lopping a branch here and there, which, sooner<br/>or
                            later, shoots out again in new vigour.</p>
<p>The United States, particularly those states in<br/> which slavery is
                            unknown, or almost eradicated,<br/>possess signal advantages for
                            securing themselves<br/>from the dreadful evils which oppress society in
                                <a href="/places/euro">Eu-rope<placename key="euro"></placename></a>; happy will they be,
                            if they have foresight and<br/>wisdom enough rightly to estimate, and
                            use, the<br/>means that Providence has been pleased thus to put<br/>into
                            their hands.</p>
<p> A law passed our state legislature, authorizing the<br/>corporation of
                            this city to erect a prison for solitary<br/>confinement, to be <emph rend="italic">solely</emph> for the punishment of
                            petty<br/>offenders, to be kept on low diet, and in solitary<br/>
                            apartments, for a term not exceeding ninety days;<br/> some accounts of
                            this plan may be seen in the<br/>account of the State Prison, page 62.
                            From observing<br/>the effects of this mode of punishment, in the
                            State<br/>Prison, where it is used to correct those who violate<br/>the
                            rules of the prison, by profane swearing, quar-<br/>relling, want of
                            cleanliness, or neglect of their alloted<br/>task of labour, &amp;c., I
                            have been led to believe it is<br/>the most efficacious that can
                            possibly be adopted.<br/>The average number of convicts is nearly 400,
                            most<br/>of whom observe a uniform, regular, and peaceable<br/>course of
                            conduct; the hardened and refractory are<br/>kept in good order, by
                            occasional punishment in the<br/>cells, which strikes such a terror on
                            their minds, that<br/>it often happens, that not a single person has
                            been<br/>punished for eight or ten days. Certain I am, that
                            a<br/>punishment of this kind will be far more beneficial<br/>than that
                            of the Bridewell, or even the State Prison,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_197" n="203"></pb>for a short
                            term; nothing so effectually subdues the<br/>intemperate and
                            ungovernable passions of men, and<br/>checks the growth of depraved
                            habits. I am appre-<br/>hensive the prison will not be erected the
                            present<br/>year, but I retain a strong hope that the plan will<br/>be
                            carried into effect.</p>
<p>By the Juliana, <a href="/people/cbrow1">Captain Brown<persname key="cbrow1"></persname></a>, I sent a
                            small<br/>box, containing a number of copies of the account of<br/>the
                            State Prison, and reports for <date when="1802">1802</date>, for thyself
                            and<br/>friends. The flattering result of this institution, to<br/>be
                            found in this report, constitutes one of the most<br/>pleasing
                            circumstances of my life, since it not only<br/>exhibits the
                            practicability of a system calculated to<br/>produce the greatest good
                            to society, but has entirely<br/> removed those strong prejudices
                            against it, in the<br/>minds of many good men, who often treated me
                            as<br/>an enthusiast, and visionary, but who now are ad-<br/>mirers of
                            the establishment, and the warmest ad-<br/>vocates for the present penal
                            code.</p>
<p>I have the farther pleasure to state, that there is<br/> abundant reason
                            to conclude, that the profits on the<br/>labour of the convicts, for
                            tile current year, will be<br/>considerably greater than at the time of
                            the last<br/>report. I inclose an abstract of the accounts for
                            six<br/>months, ending the <date when="1803-07-01">1st of the present
                                month</date>. Should<br/>it be thought expedient to reprint the
                                <q>Account of<br/>the Prison</q> in <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, it would add very much to<br/>the value of the
                            new edition, if the report last print-<br/>ed was subjoined; and it
                            would give it additional<br/>credit and circulation, if some remarks
                            were prefixed<br/>by thee, such as would naturally occur to thy
                            mind,<br/>and which thy leisure might permit thee to make.<br/>If this
                            is undertaken, I should be glad if the book-<br/>seller might be
                            directed to send me one or two hun-<br/>dred copies, to be distributed
                            in this country, and I<br/>will remit to him the cost.</p>
<p>On a late visit which I made to the Penitentiary<br/>house in <a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>, I was disappointed to
                            find<br/>that the plan of the building was bad, and little<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_198" n="204"></pb>adapted to answer the design of such an
                            establish-<br/>ment; the Keeper appears to he a decent and
                            respect-<br/>able man, and well qualified for his station;
                            the<br/>apartments are not so cleanly as I expected to find<br/>them.
                            There are fifty-nine convicts confined, fifty-<br/>seven men, and two
                            women, who appeared decent,<br/>orderly, and industrious; they were
                            employed in the<br/> manufacture of nails, shoes, and cloth. The
                            Inspec-<br/>tors are very worthy citizens, who reside in the
                            neigh-<br/>bourhood of <a href="/places/trent">Trenton<placename key="trent"></placename></a>. They
                            informed me, that the<br/>profit on the labour of the convicts, was
                            sufficient to<br/>defray the expenses of the prison. It is about
                            four<br/>years since its estabishment.</p>
<p>I also visited several times the prison of <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. This building was erected <emph rend="italic">before</emph> the alter-<br/>ations were made in their
                            penal code, and is, there-<br/>fore, not well calculated for the purpose
                            of a peniten-<br/>tiary. Prisoners <emph rend="italic">before</emph>
                            conviction, vagabonds, and<br/>disorderly persons, are also kept there,
                            and the sys-<br/>tem of order, &amp;c. does not appear equal to that
                                of<br/><a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> prison. This
                            difference is not to be im-<br/>puted to any inability, or want of
                            attention, of the<br/>Inspectors of the former, but to circumstances not
                            in<br/>their power to control. Unfortunately for <a href="/places/penns">Pennsyl-vania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, the vast number of emigrants, from
                            every<br/>country, who have settled there, and the violence of<br/>party
                            spirit, tend much to distract the government,<br/>and destroy the
                            influence of its best citizens. The<br/>political changes in the
                            administration, caused by<br/> this spirit, have also been extended to
                            the peniten-<br/>tiary, and those who have most contributed to
                            its<br/>establishment and support, are displaced to make<br/>way for new
                            men, wholly unfit to manage its con-<br/>cerns. The friends of the
                            institution feel apprehen-<br/>sive of the effects of this change on its
                            future pros-<br/>perity. It is, indeed, to be lamented, that the
                            spirit<br/> of political parties should be so violent, as to
                            check<br/>the progress of improvement, in what so
                            essentially<br/>concerns the safety and happiness of all. But I
                            must<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_199" n="205"></pb>apologize for touching on subjects of a
                            political na-<br/>ture, so foreign to the design of this letter, and
                            the<br/> habits and pursuits of my life.</p>
<p>The penitentiary house in <a href="/people/virgi">Virginia<persname key="virgi"></persname></a> has
                            been estab-<br/>lished about three years. The Inspectors are
                            respecta-<br/>ble, good men, and are appointed by the Governor
                            and<br/>Council, who also appoint the principal Keeper. I<br/>am
                            informed, political reasons influenced the Governor<br/>and Council, in
                            the appointment of a principal Keeper,<br/>who disagreed with the
                            Inspectors, and refused to<br/>submit to their directions, and is said
                            to be a very im-<br/>proper person for his place. This proves the
                            propriety<br/>of vesting in the Inspectors the power of
                            appointing<br/>the Keeper, and making <emph rend="italic">them</emph>
                            responsible for his con-<br/>duct. On the <date when="1803-01-05">5th
                                January</date> last, there were sixty-eight<br/>convicts, who were
                            employed mostly at making nails<br/>and shoes. They are allowed meat
                            only two days<br/>in the week; other days, mush, with a small
                            portion<br/>of molasses and potatoes. The laws of <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a><br/>direct, <quote>that the male convicts
                                shall have their <emph rend="italic">heads</emph><br/>and beards
                                close shaven, at least once in every week.</quote><br/>The
                            foundation of a similar prison, has been laid,<br/>this year, at
                                <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a>. The state of society in
                                <a href="/places/mass">Mas-sachusetts<placename key="mass"></placename></a>, is so very
                            favourable to good order and<br/>improvement, the opinions and habits of
                            the people,<br/>so consonant to the <emph rend="italic">true</emph>
                            principles of liberty and good<br/> government, that there is every
                            reason to expect that<br/>this establishment will be equal, in every
                            respect, to<br/>any in America, and, I have no doubt, will
                            reflect<br/>great honor on the state which formed it, and on the<br/>
                            Inspectors who may have the management of its<br/>internal
                            government.</p>
<p>The comparison made by thee, between the num-<br/>ber of convicts in
                                <a href="/places/scot">Scotland<placename key="scot"></placename></a>, and this state, is
                            extreme-<br/>ly unfavourable to the latter, and I am unwilling
                            to<br/>admit the inference that might be made from it. As<br/>to the
                            state of society here, I am certain, that a much<br/>less number of
                            criminals escape conviction here, than<br/>in Great Britain, an effect
                            that may be ascribed to<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_200" n="206"></pb>the smallness of population,
                            the facility of detection,<br/>great vigilance in the police, and the
                            mildness of our<br/>punishments. If this be true, the calendar of
                            our<br/>convicts may appear comparatively larger here,<br/>while the
                            number of crimes may be, in part, much<br/>less than in <a href="/places/scot">Scotland<placename key="scot"></placename></a>. But, on this point, I do not<br/>
                            possess sufficient information concerning that coun-<br/>try, to draw
                            any satisfactory conclusion. Both there<br/>and here, spirituous liquors
                            are, undoubtedly, the<br/>great corrupters of morals. Alcohol, in all
                            its modi-<br/>fications, is the insidious enemy of virtue and
                            happi-<br/>ness ; it saps the foundation of all the useful
                            qualities<br/>that belong to man, and is the great cause of
                            the<br/>increase of vice and criminality. How is this wide<br/>spreading
                            mischief to be destroyed? By an entire<br/>prohibition of home
                            distillation, and a heavy impost<br/>and excise on foreign spirits. But
                            this is impractica-<br/>ble here; no legislature would dare to pass such
                            a<br/>law, and no administration could carry it into exe-<br/>cution. A
                            partial application of impost and excise<br/>has produced some effect,
                            yet no great, in diminish-<br/>ing the consumption in the country. It is
                            painful<br/>to reflect, that it is only in our power to attempt
                            par-<br/>tial remedies, and to endeavour to regulate what we<br/>cannot
                            prevent. I hope, with the assistance of<br/>others, to procure the
                            adoption of a plan to prevent the<br/> increase of taverns and dram
                            shops in this city, and<br/>to lessen the number of those which already
                            exist.</p>
<p>I regret that it is not in my power to make an ade-<br/>quate return for
                            the large fund of valuable informa-<br/>tion which thou hast been so
                            kind as to send me.<br/>I can only reiterate my grateful thanks to thee

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have to thank thee for thy kind favour, of inclos-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_201" n="207"></pb>ing
                            me <a href="/people/jlanc1">Lancaster<persname key="jlanc1"></persname></a>'s pamphlet on education,
                            which<br/>has afforded me a considerable degree of satisfaction,<br/>and
                            I have been so much pleased with the outlines<br/>of it, that I have had
                            one thousand copies printed<br/>in this city and <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. I flatter myself his<br/>plan will be
                            adopted in our schools, when it becomes<br/>more generally known; and I
                            hope to introduce it<br/>in a very large school, which I expect soon to
                            get<br/> established under the protection of our city corpora-<br/>tion,
                            for the benefit of poor children, who are at<br/>present under the care
                            of our alms house. I should<br/>be much gratified to obtain such printed
                            accounts as<br/> have been published of your schools, established
                            on<br/>the plan <emph rend="italic">of promoting industry</emph>, as
                            well as useful<br/>learning.</p>
<p>In the course of last year, some persons were<br/>appointed inspectors of
                            our state prison, who, in my<br/>opinion, were no way qualified to
                            promote the design<br/>of the institution, and whose opinions respecting
                            the<br/>general management and economy were widely<br/>different from
                            mine, in consequence of which, my<br/>situation there became so
                            unpleasant, that I was<br/>induced, in <date when="1804-01">January</date> last, to resign my place as an<br/>inspector. I
                            devoted seven years in endeavouring to<br/>establish this excellent
                            institution, and am not a<br/>little mortified, that there is some
                            reason to appre-<br/>hend all my labours are like to be lost. I
                            have,<br/>however, the consolation of having the most satisfac-<br/>tory
                            and pleasing proofs of the marked approbation<br/>of every officer in
                            our government, and of all my<br/>friends. Some of the convicts, about
                            three weeks<br/>since, set fire to the prison, and destroyed the
                            whole<br/>of the roof of the north wing; it is now repairing,<br/>and
                            will soon be under cover. This circumstance hap-<br/>pened, in
                            consequence of neglect in the assistant<br/>keepers, who have all been
                            appointed lately, as all<br/>the old ones resigned immediately after
                            myself and<br/>the old inspectors.</p>

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I am quite ashamed to discover, on recurring to<br/>my correspondence on
                            the affairs of philanthropy and<br/>humanity, that I have been so long
                            your debtor for<br/>a reply to your favour of the <date when="1803-07-15">fifteenth of July last<br/>year</date>, which
                            reached me on the <date when="1803-09-21">twenty-first of
                                Sep-<br/>tember</date> following; since which period, even
                            until<br/> this hour, my time has been so constantly occu-<br/>pied, by
                            a necessary attention to a great variety<br/>of public business as a
                            magistrate, a deputy lieutenant,<br/>&amp;c., that I have had scarce any
                            time for those pur-<br/>suits, to which I am so much inclined to direct
                            my<br/>attention. This circumstance, however, has not<br/>prevented me
                            from establishing two schools in the<br/>city of <a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, where I reside; the one for 200<br/>boys,
                            who, with the assistance of monitors, selected<br/>from the most acute
                            of the pupils, act as ushers under<br/><emph rend="italic">one
                                master</emph>; and I have also establised since, a school<br/>for
                            200 girls, who are taught agreeably to the same<br/> system, by <emph rend="italic">one mistress</emph>.</p>
<p>Inclosed I send you one of the proof sheets con-<br/>taining an account
                            of our proceedings, by which you<br/>will perceive the vast disparity on
                            the score of<br/>expense, between the new and old method of
                            com-<br/>municating appropriate instruction to the lower<br/>classes of
                            the people. I likewise send you one of<br/>my reports, which were
                            circulated early in the pre-<br/>sent year, which procured us, as you
                            will observe,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_203" n="209"></pb>the countenance and support of the first
                            characters<br/>residing in this quarter of the metropolis.</p>
<p><a href="/people/jlanc1">Mr. Lancaster<persname key="jlanc1"></persname></a> has received from me
                            every counte-<br/>nance and protection in his laudable exertions,
                            which<br/>I could afford, either by advice or recommendation;<br/>and
                            the result has been, that many of our philan-<br/>thropists, as well as
                            some of our first nobility, have<br/>visited him, and now afford him
                            both their counte-<br/>nance and protection; and you will perceive from
                            the<br/>inclosed advertisement, that he has attempted the<br/>gigantic
                            task of teaching by his own efforts, no less<br/>than <emph rend="italic">one thousand boys</emph>, with the assistance of
                            monitors.<br/>I consider his system as a great and important

                            rising<br/>generation, in habits of religion and morality; and<br/>I
                            trust and hope, it will become universal all over<br/>Great Britain,
                                <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, and the United States; as
                            a<br/>means of ameliorating the state of society in future<br/>times,
                            and of diminishing the mass of crimes, and<br/>the demand for
                            punishment, among those who are to<br/>succeed the adults of the present
                            age, whose irregu-<br/>larities and turpitude cannot easily be kept
                            within<br/>due bounds. And it is a matter of no little regret,<br/>that
                            where efforts are used upon proper and correct<br/>principles, for
                            checking crimes and penal offences,<br/> that we find in America, as
                            well as here, cabals, and<br/>individuals disposed to place obstructions
                            in the way<br/>of the due and proper execution of every
                            good<br/>measure.</p>
<p>I am very much concerned, (from your letter of the<br/><date when="1804-06-20">20th of June</date> recently received,) that you
                            have been<br/>compelled to abandon the superintendence of

                            that species of paramount<br/>interference, which will bring back to the

                            of<br/>reports, published by our Society for bettering the<br/>condition
                            of the Poor, since the last that I forwarded;<br/>and it is my intention
                            to send you the succeeding<br/>numbers, as they are published; also the
                            reports of a<br/>very active society for the suppression of vice,
                            which<br/>was instituted in this metropolis about three years<br/>ago,
                            and which has been productive of a great deal<br/>of good, in disclosing
                            and bringing to punishment<br/>the perpetrators of acts of debauchery
                            and wicked-<br/>ness, which, from the degree of turpitude annexed
                            to<br/>it, almost exceeds credibility. Such are the evils<br/>which
                            affect large societies, that it requires the con-<br/>stant and watchful
                            eye of the <emph rend="italic">moralist</emph> and the<br/><emph rend="italic">philanthropist</emph>, to keep them in check. You are
                            hap-<br/>pily free as yet from many of these evils; and an<br/>attention
                            to the education of youth will be the only<br/>means of prevention;
                            since, in the course of time, large<br/>cities will arise in America,
                            and a population equal<br/>to all Europe will cover its forests in less
                            than a<br/>century.</p>
<p>I am much gratified to find that my remarks on<br/>public education and
                            preventive police met your<br/>approbation. Notwithstanding the
                            unexampled be-<br/>nevolence and munificence which pervades
                            this<br/>country, the interruptions we experience in obtaining<br/>wise
                            and salutary laws, in consequence of the wars<br/>in which we are
                            unhappily involved, is very great.<br/>This excessive calamity obstructs
                            the adoption of<br/>many wise and salutary regulations, which the
                            state<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_205" n="211"></pb>of society imperiously calls for. I have
                            circulated<br/>your excellent work on prisons among the very
                            first<br/>and most elevated characters in this country and
                                in<br/><a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>, and I yet indulge
                            a hope, that in the course<br/>of Providence we may enjoy the blessings
                            of peace,<br/>when an opportunity will be offered, ere long,
                            to<br/>follow the good example that is set before us. Your<br/>mode of
                            correction by solitary confinement, under<br/>certain regulations, is
                            excellent; and the result of<br/> the various experiments which have
                            been made,<br/>prove it to be wise and salutary, and that the
                            measure<br/>did not proceed from visionary or enthusiastic
                            ideas.<br/>Where punishment produces amendment, and restores<br/>
                            offenders again to society, renovated and reformed; and<br/>where this
                            great desideratum can be obtained, with-<br/>out expense to a nation or
                            to individuals, it may be<br/>truly affirmed, that this great and
                            important branch<br/>of criminal police has arrived at the greatest
                            height<br/>of perfection of which human institutions are
                            sus-<br/>ceptible: but the misfortune is, that in the affairs<br/>of
                            society, every thing depends on the <emph rend="italic">purity</emph>,
                            the <emph rend="italic">dis-<br/>cretion</emph>, <emph rend="italic">abilities</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">zeal</emph>, of those who
                            conduct public<br/>institutions. In good hands they flourish;
                            while<br/>under a less careful, zealous, and intelligent
                            manage-<br/>ment, they retrograde and decay. It is to a diversity<br/>of
                            opinion, often among well intentioned men, who<br/>do not well consider
                            the subject, or whose judgments<br/>are deficient, or their passions
                            predominant, that<br/>many excellent institutions are imperfect in
                            their<br/>first concoction, and under these disadvantages,
                            coupled<br/>with want of intelligence and zeal in the manage-<br/>ment,
                            do not succeed. I am happy to hear so good<br/>an account of the
                            penitentiary house in <a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>.
                            <br/>That of <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> is well
                            known from the various<br/>accounts which have been given of this
                            excellent<br/> institution, and it is indeed much to be
                            lamented,<br/>that the spirit of party should extend its
                            influence,<br/>so as to disturb the economy of those
                            establishments,<br/>which have been instituted for the general benefit
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_206" n="212"></pb>of the community at large. Where any public
                            con-<br/>cern in the minor regulations of the state is going
                            on<br/>well, changes constantly produce evil; and although<br/>men of
                            equal talents and integrity supplant those<br/>that have been heretofore
                            in the management of<br/>gratuitous undertakings, the deficiency of
                            knowledge<br/>and experience never fail to generate evils, and
                            to<br/>check the progress of improvement.</p>
<p>It is a pleasing circumstance to hear, that peni-<br/>tentiary houses
                            have been established in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a><br/>and in <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a>. Various circumstances lead me to<br/>expect
                            that the latter will be well managed. When-<br/>ever political influence
                            is interposed in the appoint-<br/>ment of officers or managers, it
                            rarely happens that<br/>the best selection is made.</p>
<p>It is certainly true, that many actual criminals<br/>escape punishment in
                            Great Britain, and many reign<br/>for a number of years, and continue in
                            the pursuit<br/>of crimes by which they support themselves,
                            before<br/>the public justice of the country can be made to<br/>attach
                            to them; and it is also true, that in America,<br/>from the peculiar
                            state of society, crimes by being<br/>easier detected and proved, allow
                            very few culprits<br/>to escape. But this apparent difficulty of
                            conviction<br/>is chiefly confined to this metropolis, and to the
                            popu-<br/>lous towns in different parts of the kingdom.
                                In<br/><a href="/places/scot">Scotland<placename key="scot"></placename></a>, however, which
                            does not contain one third<br/>of the population of America, it is
                            somewhat similar<br/>to your country, and I am inclined to believe,
                            except-<br/>ing in its capital, and two or three large towns,
                            that<br/>very few who are guilty escape detection and pun-<br/>ishment.
                            The limited number of crimes in that<br/> country, is to be attributed
                            chiefly to the attention<br/>heretofore paid to the religious and moral
                            education<br/>of the inferior orders of society. I am sorry,
                            however,<br/>to learn from persons of intelligence in that
                            country,<br/>that the progress of wealth, arising from
                            productive<br/>industry, and the extension of manufactures,
                            has<br/>produced changes not favourable to the morals of the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_207" n="213"></pb>people, which, of course, will have the effect to
                            generate<br/>crimes. Such is the evil consequences of natural<br/>wealth
                            suddenly acquired, that it is always counter-<br/>balanced by evils in
                            the opposite scale.</p>
<p>What you have most of all to dread in America, as<br/>a general corrupter
                            of morals, is the want of a due<br/>control on public houses and liquor
                            shops, in your<br/>bung-hole towns. Until publicans of all
                            descriptions<br/>are licensed, and put under strict regulations,
                            the<br/>abuses through this medium will increase, and pro-<br/>duce
                            excessive evils, which will be almost without a<br/>remedy, if not
                            prevented in due time.</p>
<p>The prohibition of distillation can never be expect-<br/>ed in any
                            country, and therefore all we can hope for,<br/><emph rend="italic">is a
                                strong control over those who deal it out to the pro-<br/>fligate
                                and the idle</emph>, and to those who are influenced<br/>by their
                            example.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the last year, I published<br/>a tract on the duty
                            of a constable, which I first meant<br/>for the instruction of those in
                                <a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>; but<br/>in the
                            progress of the composition, while the press<br/>was going, I was
                            induced to snatch an occasional<br/>hour from public business, and to
                            extend it so as to<br/>apply to all England. In the appendix to this
                            tract,<br/>I have introduced <emph rend="italic">rules</emph> and <emph rend="italic">orders</emph> for publicans. I<br/>shall send you this
                            work, with others. You will<br/>find in it a tolerable epitome of the
                            manner in which<br/>the general police of <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> is conducted. I wish<br/>I could say it was
                            conducted according to the true<br/>and genuine spirit of the laws, upon
                            which the sys-<br/>tem is founded.</p>
<p>I conclude with my best thanks for the obliging<br/> communications you
                            have made to me, and the valua-<br/>ble books and papers you have had
                            the goodness to<br/>send me on the interesting subject of Police.</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p> Since I had the pleasure of receiving thy much<br/>esteemed favour of
                                <date when="1804-08-08">8th of August</date> in the last year,
                            I<br/> have been several times absent on distant journeys,<br/>and have
                            not enjoyed my health equal to former<br/>years, but this is not
                            sufficient to excuse my very<br/>great neglect, and particularly in not
                            acknowledging<br/>the receipt of thy very acceptable parcel of books
                            by<br/>the Alexander, for which be pleased accept my sin-<br/>cere
                            thanks. I repeatedly intended writing by dif-<br/>ferent ships that
                            sailed from <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, but
                            unac-<br/>countably put it off from one opportunity to another,<br/>and
                            now not being able to justify my neglect, I have<br/>only to crave thy
                            indulgence in excusing it.</p>
<p>The pamphlet on guineas, &amp;c., by <a href="/people/hbone1">Henry
                                Boner<persname key="hbone1"></persname></a>,<br/>Esq., afforded me much entertainment and
                            useful<br/>information. The subject of paper credit is
                            highly<br/>interesting, and particularly so to us on this side
                            the<br/>Atlantic, where paper currency is largely emited by<br/>a great
                            number of banks, spread over almost every<br/>state in the union. The
                            solidity of these establish-<br/>ments are rendered exceedingly
                            hazardous, by dis-<br/>counting mostly what is termed
                            accommodation<br/>notes, which are renewed and continued at the end<br/>
                            of sixty days, and go on year after year. The bank<br/>notes issued of
                            course must be very considerable,<br/>without any thing solid to
                            represent them, except<br/>the credit of the names of the drawer and
                            endorser.<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_211" n="215"></pb>In my apprehension, the business of banks
                            should be<br/>confined to discounting what is termed business<br/>notes,
                            except only under some peculiar circumstances,<br/>otherways the credit
                            of the banks is liable to be<br/>materially injured.</p>
<p>I am not well acquainted with the affairs of our<br/>Prison, since myself
                            and colleagues resigned our<br/> places. The present inspectors, in my
                            opinion, are<br/>not so suitable characters for the government of
                            that<br/>institution, as might have been selected amongst
                            our<br/>citizens; the mode of treating the prisoners is in<br/> some
                            respects more severe than was thought neces-<br/>sary by the former
                            board of inspectors, and the profits<br/>on the labour of the convicts
                            are considerably short of<br/>what was produced the year ending <date when="1803-07-01">1st July 1803</date>.<br/>Cleanliness and good
                            order throughout the prison, is<br/>perhaps as well observed as
                            formerly, and notwith-<br/>standing the increased expense for supporting
                            the<br/>prison, the legislature remains firmly attached to
                            our<br/>present criminal code, and I trust it will continue
                            an<br/>ornament to our country, and serve as an example<br/>to other
                            governments.</p>
<p>The excellent sentiments contained in thy several<br/>letters and the
                            pamphlets thou so kindly sent me, has<br/>so interested me in the
                            subject of affording a suitable<br/>education to the children of the
                            poor, that I have been<br/>much engaged in a new establishment for
                            schooling<br/>poor children, who are not provided for by
                            any<br/>religious society. Our state legislature have passed<br/>an act
                            incorporating this society; the mayor of the<br/>city is president, and
                            the public appear much inte-<br/>rested in its support. I trust the poor
                            will derive<br/>great benefit by means of it, and we expect
                            next<br/>winter our legislature will provide sufficient funds<br/>for
                            supporting it. It must afford great pleasure to<br/>every feeling mind,
                            that the plan of affording reli-<br/>gious and moral instruction to the
                            poor of your<br/>country, has so much engaged the attention of
                            so<br/>great a number of highly respectable characters, and<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_212" n="216"></pb>I sincerely hope the time is not very far distant,<br/>when
                            you will have the countenance and assistance<br/>of your government in
                            improving your poor laws,<br/>which undoubtedly have hitherto tended to
                            increase<br/>the number, and indeed the misery of the poor.</p>
<p>I beg thou wilt accept of my most hearty thanks,<br/>for the reports of
                            the Society for Bettering the Condi-<br/>tion of the Poor, which I
                            expect to receive the next<br/>time of my going to the environs of the
                            city.</p>
<p>I should be much gratified, if thou wouldst be so<br/>good as to inform
                            me of the present state of the school<br/>under the care of <a href="/people/jlanc1">Lancaster<persname key="jlanc1"></persname></a>. I wrote him about two<br/>years

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I have postponed acknowledging the receipt of<br/>your acceptable favour,
                            of the <date when="1805-09-09">9th September</date>, last<br/>year, from
                            month to month, in hopes of being able to<br/>make such communications
                            on the subject of political<br/>economy, as I conceived ought to be
                            acceptable; but<br/>my public duties have become so multifarious, as
                            to<br/>afford me less time than I could wish, although I
                            can<br/>conscientiously say, that I do not waste a moment in<br/>any
                            pursuit that has not public or private utility for<br/>its object. The
                            banking system, if conducted on<br/>a proper principle, has certainly a
                            great tendency to<br/>give efficacy and extension to human labour,
                            which,<br/>you well know, is the only source of wealth in every<br/>
                            country; and, perhaps, no nation upon earth has<br/>been more indebted
                            to the powerful effect of credit<br/>and confidence than this, in giving
                            a spring to the<br/>industry and enterprise of the people, and
                            thereby<br/> rendering every species of human labour extremely<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_213" n="217"></pb> productive. I have been turning my thoughts a
                            good<br/>deal of late to this interesting branch of
                            political<br/>economy, as it relates to the effect produced in
                            Great<br/>Britain, through this medium, and the result of my<br/>
                            researches have perfectly astonished me. Seeing<br/>that the rapid
                            increase of our taxes, and the enor-<br/>mous public expense, occasioned
                            by the war, did not<br/>appear to diminish, in the smallest degree, the
                            splen-<br/>dour of living, or the general comfort of the people,<br/>I
                            was induced to search for the causes which pro-<br/>duced what appeared
                            to me to be a very extraordi-<br/>nary phenomenon, namely, the <emph rend="italic">sources from whence<br/>have sprung those forty
                                millions</emph>, for the purposes of<br/>the state, and <emph rend="italic">five millions</emph> and upwards, for the
                            sup-<br/>port of the poor, and other purposes, and to leave<br/>behind a
                            surplus sufficient to enable so considerable<br/>a proportion of our
                            population to live in ease and<br/>affluence. I was apprehensive all was
                            not sound,<br/>because, in order to support this expense, a new
                            pro-<br/>perty from <emph rend="italic">labour</emph> must be created
                            yearly; and, the<br/>question to be solved was this, in what
                            manner,<br/>and by what means is it exacted?—I found after<br/>much
                            research, that it arose <emph rend="italic">solely from six
                                branches<br/>of industry</emph>, and that these, upon a full
                            investigation<br/>of the subject, upon which I recently occupied
                            myself<br/> without intermission, for four weeks, secluded in
                            the<br/>country, amounted to the enormous sum of 222,000,000<br/><emph rend="italic">pounds sterling yearly</emph>!-—The produce of the
                            land, in<br/>vegetable and animal productions, has arisen to
                            a<br/>height beyond all belief, while the bowels of the<br/>earth yield
                            a very large sum annually, from mines<br/>and minerals. Our
                            manufactures, of every kind,<br/> produced from labour and machinery,
                            invigorated<br/>by skill, enterprise, and capital, in working up
                            raw<br/>materials, have so exceedingly augmented, that our<br/>exports
                            alone are ascertained to exceed forty millions<br/>sterling a year. Our
                            foreign commerce exhibits an<br/>export and import, which, together,
                            exceed one hun-<br/>dred millions annually, and all these sources
                            have<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_214" n="218"></pb>been progressively increasing, while our
                            colonial<br/>East India possessions add considerably to the

<p>Such are the resources of the country, by which it<br/>is enabled

                            power-<br/>ful tyrants that ever assailed the liberties of
                            man-<br/>kind, or afflicted the nations of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.—And, after<br/>all, this income is confined to
                            nine millions of people,<br/>in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a>;
                            and, high as the taxes are,<br/>even including 10 per cent. upon income,
                            they do<br/>not exceed 18 per cent. upon the new property annu-<br/>ally
                            created; while the national debt in sterling<br/>money is not yet much
                            above two years value of the<br/>national income, while the sinking
                            fund, applicable to<br/>its reduction, now amounts to <emph rend="italic">twelve millions</emph> a year,<br/>and from the
                            accumulating operation which it pos-<br/>sesses, is daily
                            increasing.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_215" n="219"></pb>
<p>Such, my good sir, is the effect of well directed<br/>labour, aided by
                            skill, enterprise, and capital; and<br/>such are the means by which
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> continues to<br/>enjoy
                            that elevated height to which she has attained.<br/>Yet, these
                            advantages are not without their evils,<br/>and disadvantages. In the
                            year <date when="1688">1688</date>, (118 years ago,)<br/>Mr. <a href="/people/gking1">Gregory King<persname key="gking1"></persname></a>, an eminent political economist
                            of<br/>the 17th century, estimated the national income at<br/>48
                            millions, on a population of 5,500,000 persons;<br/>now, it is estimated
                            at 222,000,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. in a population<br/>of
                            somewhat less than nine millions, in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a><br/>and <a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a>. The incovenience we feel, is, that
                            dis-<br/>soluteness of manners, and moral and criminal<br/>offences,
                            increase with the opulence of the country.</p>
<p>Our poor, either wholly or partially, maintained at<br/>the public
                            expense, have been found, upon an accu-<br/>rate investigation, to
                            exceed 1,040,000 persons, and<br/>the whole annual expense, applicable
                            to them alone,<br/>is somewhat more than 4,700,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. a year, which ex-<br/>ceeds the whole revenue of most of
                            the nations of<br/><a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, and is more
                            than that of <a href="/places/denm">Denmark<placename key="denm"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/swede">Swe-den<placename key="swede"></placename></a> put together.</p>
<p>In order, as far as possible, to counteract this gan-<br/>grene in the
                            body politic, and to give energy and<br/>effect to the industry of the
                            country, and to contri-<br/>bute to its happiness and prosperity, I have
                            publish-<br/>ed, this last Summer, a tract on the education of
                            the<br/>poor, which I send you, under cover. I know you<br/>will read it
                            with avidity, because it is not only a<br/>subject in which you have, on
                            all occasions, very<br/>much interested yourself, but because it is
                            treated in<br/>a manner somewhat new, while it contains many<br/>strong
                            points, calculated not only to excite attention,<br/> but, I trust, to
                            be useful in America, and in every<br/>civilized country. I am, at
                            present, engaged in com-<br/>piling another work on the subject of the
                            poor, which<br/>is also treated in a manner different from other
                            au-<br/>thors who have written on the subject. I hope, in a<br/>couple
                            of months, to present it to the public, when I<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_216" n="220"></pb>shall
                            not fail to send you a copy; and, I trust, it<br/>may be found to
                            contain matter applicable to Ame-<br/>rica, where the morals in vulgar
                            life are so assimi-<br/>lated to those of <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, that the same remedies<br/>will apply in both
                            countries. You will see, however,<br/>in the treatise on education, that
                            I have given some<br/>details, relative to the criminality of the
                            country,<br/> which I have enlarged upon in the treatise on
                            indi-<br/>gence, which now occupies my attention. The war<br/>eases us
                            of many idle and dissolute characters, who<br/>find employment in the
                            army and navy; yet, the<br/>calendar of delinquency greatly exceeds what
                            could<br/>be wished, and much remains to be done to counter-<br/>act the
                            evils which opulence produces in society,<br/> joined to a want of
                            proper attention to the religious<br/>and moral instruction of the poor.
                            You will see,<br/>from the subject of this letter, that it is only
                            meant<br/>for your own eye, or that of your private friends.<br/> I
                            shall soon write you again, and send you the report,<br/>published last
                            year, by our society for bettering the<br/>condition of the poor. I fear
                            nothing but legislative<br/>measures, adapted to the present state of
                            society, will<br/>produce that general amelioration, which is so
                            much<br/> wanted.</p>

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been waiting from month to month, in con-<br/>sequence of the
                            constant revolving of things in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>,<br/>in the expectation that the gloom which had
                            over-<br/>cast the political hemisphere would have been dis-<br/>pelled,
                            and that 1 should be able to resume my too<br/>long protracted
                            correspondence, by the contemplation<br/>of subjects more congenial to
                            your feelings and my<br/>own, than those which the present times have
                            gene-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_218" n="222"></pb> rated. My constant occupations too, as a
                            magistrate,<br/>presiding in a court of justice every day of my
                            life,<br/>(Sundays only excepted,) while I am in <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, joined<br/>to other important occupations, I am
                            sure will plead<br/>my apology for delaying for so long a period,
                            to<br/>notice your two obliging letters of the <date when="1807-03-19">nineteenth<br/>of March</date> and <date when="1807-06-05">fifth
                                June</date>, last year, which I am ashamed<br/>to say, that I now
                            find among my unanswered let-<br/>ters. For a good many years past, I
                            have been able<br/>to arrange matters, so as to be able to retire
                            with<br/>my family for a few weeks during the summer sea-<br/>son to
                            some part of the country near the sea; and in<br/>this seclusion, I
                            generally devote my time to that<br/>species of business which my
                            numerous public duties<br/>in the metropolis oblige me to postpone. I
                            have,<br/>therefore, brought to this retired picturesque country<br/>all
                            my unavoidably postponed letters; and among<br/>the rest, your two
                            favours above mentioned.</p>
<p>It cannot fail to afford me the most heartfelt satis-<br/>faction to
                            learn, that the works I send you on <emph rend="italic">Indi-<br/>gence</emph>, and on the <emph rend="italic">Education of
                                the Poor</emph>, are likely,<br/> under the sanction of your
                            patriotic exertions, to<br/>prove useful in ameliorating the state of
                            society in<br/>America, and of diffusing comfort and happiness<br/>among
                            the <emph rend="italic">inferior orders</emph> in the United States,
                            who<br/>constitute the mass of the people in all nations.
                            A<br/>disposition certainly exists in this country, to adopt<br/>many of
                            the public measures I have recommended;<br/>but I have written at an
                            era, when in the rapid<br/>succession of the most extraordinary events,
                                <emph rend="italic">fears</emph><br/>have been generated, even for
                            the security of the<br/>liberties and independence of our own
                            country,<br/> arising from the growing power of the ruler
                                of<br/><a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a>, and the wreck of
                            nations, and ancient king-<br/>doms and states, which have, in rapid
                            succession, been<br/>brought under his sway; and hence, from an
                            atten-<br/>tion to the primary object of guarding against dan-<br/>gers,
                            which appeared to become more and more<br/>imminent, all considerations
                            connected with internal<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_219" n="223"></pb>economy, are either neglected
                            or postponed—and my<br/>chief, and only consolation, under such
                            circumstances,<br/> is this, <q><emph rend="italic">that having put my
                                    statements and proofs upon<br/>record, and finding that they
                                    meet the approbation of<br/>all good men, that the time will
                                    come</emph>, (perhaps when<br/>I cease to exist in this world,)
                                    <emph rend="italic">when these writings will<br/>be legislated
                                    upon:</emph> and that essential benefit will be<br/>derived from
                                them to millions of people yet unborn,<br/>not only in my own
                                country, but in many parts of<br/>the civilized world.</q></p>
<p>You and I, my dear sir, have indeed lived in won-<br/>derful times: since
                            the wildest efforts of the most<br/>romantic fancy could not have imaged
                            the extraor-<br/>dinary events, which for the last fifteen years,
                            have<br/>been passing under our review; and it should seem<br/>that
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> is now upon the eve of
                            tracing back the<br/>steps, which have already so much convulsed
                            it.<br/>The events which have recently taken place in <a href="/places/spain">Spain<placename key="spain"></placename></a>,<br/>indicate a <emph rend="italic">complete revolution in the government and<br/>character of the
                                people of that country</emph>, who, according<br/>to all human
                            appearance, are likely to succeed in<br/>their arduous struggle; the
                            result of which will be,<br/>that they will secure to themselves a
                            greater portion<br/>of civil liberty, and may become a great and a
                            pow-<br/>erful people: while other nations on the
                            continent,<br/>emulating their example, and stimulated by
                            their<br/>success, may also be able greatly to improve
                            their<br/>existing hard and miserable condition. Towards the<br/>
                            completion of these great events, under Providence,<br/><a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> is likely, by her prowess and
                            opulence,<br/>greatly to contribute, and thereby to re-establish
                            her<br/> influence and preponderance in the scale of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.<br/>This state of things cannot
                            escape the penetrating<br/>minds of the rulers of America; and I trust
                            will<br/> incline them to cling closer to the parent country,<br/>and be
                            less disposed to indulge partialities to foreign<br/>countries, where
                            councils are more insidious, and<br/>where political views and maxims
                            have never, in one<br/> instance, been directed towards the real
                            interest of<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_220" n="224"></pb>the United States; who, if they concede, or
                            appear<br/>to concede any thing, it is only with a view to
                            make<br/>America an instrument in the hands of <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a>, to<br/>assist her in the ruin and the
                            subjugation of Great<br/>Britain, that she may aftewards, in the
                            plenitude of<br/>her power, also subjugate America.</p>
<p>When all hopes of commercial intercourse seemed<br/>to be at an end, with
                            respect to the continent—when<br/>all the powers submitted to the
                            mandates of a<br/>formerly obscure individual—Three short
                            months<br/>have produced most extraordinary events—<emph rend="italic">The great<br/>peninsula of <a href="/places/spain">Spain<placename key="spain"></placename></a>
                                and <a href="/places/portu">Portugal<placename key="portu"></placename></a> have thrown off
                                the<br/>yoke</emph>. Their ports are not only open, but they
                            are<br/> actually now become the allies of Great Britain!—<br/>What a
                            change!—how vain the hopes of men!—<br/>how uncertain the issue of the
                            schemes of the most<br/>powerful and the most fortunate dealer in war.
                            An<br/>all wise Providence frustrates at once the
                            arrogant<br/>pretensions of the boldest, and for a while, the
                            most<br/>successful adventurer.</p>
<p>Lamentable to say, it should seem, that the strug-<br/>gle for dominion,
                            and the din and clangour of war<br/>is only commencing. Formerly, it was
                            between an<br/>usurper and ancient sovereigns: now, it is
                            between<br/>the people at large, struggling for liberty, and
                            the<br/>different usurpers of ancient thrones. <emph rend="italic">The

                            them,<br/>either producing immediate distress, or working upon<br/>the
                            religious prejudices of the mass of the people,<br/>could scarcely fail
                            to produce convulsion;—and hence,<br/>already symptoms of the spirit of
                            resistance mani-<br/>fested by <a href="/places/spain">Spain<placename key="spain"></placename></a>,
                            begin to manifest themselves in<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_221" n="225"></pb>Italy, and other parts
                            of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, indicating
                            disposition<br/>towards new revolutions, and new scenes of
                            rapine<br/>and bloodshed. It must be so, in order to improve<br/>the
                            state of society, since the result of the measures<br/> and policy of
                            Buonaparte, has been only to bind the<br/>people faster in chains, and
                            to make his vassal kings<br/>the contemptible instruments whereby these
                            chains<br/>were to be rivetted upon themselves and their people.<br/>It
                            is only, I fear, by new revolutions, therefore, that<br/>the ameliorated
                            state of things, which you conceive<br/>likely to arise out of the
                            troubles in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, are to
                            be<br/>effected. In the meantime, <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> has gained a<br/>great point with respect to
                            her commerce; since, not<br/>only <emph rend="italic">all <a href="/places/spain">Spain<placename key="spain"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/portu">Portugal<placename key="portu"></placename></a></emph>, but their vast posses-<br/>sions
                            in the west and east, will be opened to this<br/> country; since these
                            countries and their future inde-<br/>pendence have only been saved,
                                <emph rend="italic">under Providence</emph>, by<br/>her paramount

<p>Let us hope that these evils will determine America<br/>to enter into a
                            close alliance with this country—she<br/>has nothing to fear from
                                <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a>. Her embargo
                            has<br/>rather been of service than otherwise to <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>.<br/> It will probably throw into the hands of

                            will compel this country to call forth all the ener-<br/>gies of the
                            British American colonies, by large boun-<br/>ties and other
                            encouragements, to cultivate, in a greater<br/>degree, those articles
                            which the United States were<br/>accustomed to send to the British West
                            Indies, in<br/>order to be secured against the recurrence of a
                                similar<br/>measure—<emph rend="italic">another embargo</emph>. The
                            privations suffered<br/>by a temporary suspension of trade between
                            Britain<br/> and America, will be useful to both countries. It<br/>will
                            enable the people to pay their old debts, with-<br/>out, at the same
                            time, commencing new ones, and will<br/>cause a great capital to enter
                            with the British credi-<br/>tor. I declare to you, I never could view
                            the embar-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_222" n="226"></pb>go in the light of a misfortune to this
                            country—I<br/>rather consider it as an advantage. My treatise
                            on<br/>indigence will show you how small a proportion of<br/>the
                            national wealth is derived from commerce, great<br/>and unexampled in
                            point of extent as it unquestion-<br/>ably is—perhaps equal to all the
                            nations of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a><br/>put
                            together.</p>
<p>In another point of view, it may be considered, under<br/>Providence, to
                            be the only bar that existed to the<br/>
<emph rend="italic">total subjugation of all <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> and America to the<br/>yoke of <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a></emph>. If her maritime power had
                            not<br/>existed, and she had abstained from, or waved what<br/>she calls
                            her maritime rights, upon which her power<br/>chiefly depends, what
                            would have become of the<br/>world at this era? The United States, but
                            for this<br/> powerful barrier, must have ultimately fallen
                            under<br/>the power of the tyrant of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>; whose ambition<br/>has no bounds, and who may
                            justly be considered as<br/>a scourge in the hands of the Almighty, to
                            punish the<br/>offences of the nations of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, and permitted to<br/>reign for a time. Let us
                            hope that his career is<br/>nearly at a close; and that the nations of
                                <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>,<br/>convinced of the folly
                            and the great calamities of<br/>war, will resolve to cling to the olive
                            branch, and<br/>cultivate the arts of peace. America, above all<br/>
                            countries in the world, ought to avoid war—she is<br/>every way
                            vulnerable, without the means of defence.<br/><a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> is not what she was during the war of
                            the<br/>revolution. Her unexampled naval power has ban-<br/>ished the
                            belligerent flag every where from the ocean;<br/>and powerful as the
                            French are on land, yet when<br/>they come in contact with British
                            troops on that<br/> element, they are compelled (as has been seen
                            almost<br/>in every instance) to yield the palm to <emph rend="italic">British valour<br/>and discipline</emph>. Let us, therefore, hope
                            that <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a><br/>and America will form
                            a permanent union, as the<br/>best means of preserving the peace of the
                            world, and<br/>promoting the best interests of the human species.</p>
<p>The attainment of this great object now that<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_223" n="227"></pb>men's minds
                            are becoming more enlightened, would<br/>open an extensive field among
                            the higher ranks of<br/>society, for diffusing those blessings which
                            would be<br/> conferred upon mankind by <emph rend="italic">good
                                laws</emph>, and useful<br/>regulations in civil polity. Much as has
                            been done,<br/>it is yet but little in comparison to what is
                            still<br/>required to complete this great work. I would wil-<br/>lingly
                            flatter myself, when the happy period of peace<br/>arrives, that the
                            improvements will not be confined<br/>to the British dominions, but will
                            extend over all<br/>Europe, and the civilized world.</p>
<p>The lower orders of the people, from whose labour<br/>we derive all that
                            we possess, have never been<br/> proper objects of attention in any
                            country. Much<br/>might be done to render them better subjects
                            and<br/>citizens—to extend to them greater comforts, by a<br/>stronger
                            sense of religious and moral duties; and to<br/>add much to the means of
                            subsisting themselves and<br/>families in a better manner. The wise and
                            benevo-<br/>lent rulers and statesmen in every country, have much<br/>in
                            their power in this respect; whereby a nation<br/>may be rendered happy
                            and contented with its<br/>government, indisposed to changes and
                            revolutions,<br/> and prone by industry and sober habits to add to
                            the<br/>state of national happiness. Perhaps, at no period<br/>in the
                            history of this country, has there existed so<br/>great a disposition
                            among the well educated ranks<br/>to promote these benevolent views. But
                                <emph rend="italic">war—fatal<br/>war</emph>—checks the progress of
                            every thing that is good.<br/>Let me hope so great a calamity will never
                            afflict<br/>the United States. The efforts of individuals are<br/>useful
                            in promoting all benevolent purposes: but the<br/>aid and countenance of
                            the State is necessary, to give<br/>permanency and consistency to all
                            measures tending<br/>to ameliorate the condition of the labouring
                            people;<br/>and to check, where it is necessary, the zeal of
                            indi-<br/>viduals, when not accompanied by good judgment.<br/>Hence the
                            immense sums bequeathed in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>
                            for<br/>benevolent purposes, under circumstances often so<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_224" n="228"></pb><emph rend="italic">crude, indigested,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">whimsical</emph>, as to be productive of<br/>more
                            injury than benefit. Hence, the injuries arising<br/>from these
                            excellent institutions, the Friendly Socie-<br/>ties, as now constituted
                            in this country. We have<br/>resources within our grasp, capable of
                                compassing<br/><emph rend="italic">any thing</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">every thing</emph>, that is good,
                                praiseworthy,<br/><emph rend="italic">and benevolent</emph>, if we
                            could be made to see how we<br/> should avail ourselves of our powers. I
                            trust that<br/>period is fast approaching, and that new and
                            better<br/>prospects will enliven our declining years.</p>
<p>I rejoice exceedingly, to find that the schools you<br/> have
                            benevolently established through the medium<br/>of a society in
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, assisted by my
                            publication<br/>on the education of the poor, according to <a href="/people/abell1">DoctorBell<persname key="abell1"></persname></a>'s excellent plan, has
                            succeeded to an extent equal<br/>to your most sanguine expectations. I
                            will be very<br/>thankful to you for a copy of the report, which
                            the<br/>trustees proposed to publish, as soon as it is printed.<br/>It
                            occurs to me that an account of the <emph rend="italic">origin,
                                use</emph>, and<br/><emph rend="italic">progress of these
                                schools</emph>, with the advantages which<br/>have resulted from
                            them, accompanied by some useful<br/>reflections, would form an
                            excellent article in the<br/>periodical reports of our society for
                            bettering the con-<br/>dition of the poor: and if you will have the
                            goodness<br/>to draw up a paper on the subject, with that
                            particu-<br/>lar view, I will take care to get it inserted. It
                            may<br/>induce many in this country to follow your laudable<br/>
                            example.</p>
<p>The bill brought in to the Commons' House of Par-<br/>liament, for the
                            establishment of parochial schools in<br/><a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/wales">Wales<placename key="wales"></placename></a>,
                            was lost in the house of lords.<br/>The system proposed had by no means
                            the approba-<br/>tion of many respectable persons, who had
                            bestowed<br/>much time in considering the subject; but when<br/>peace is
                            restored, the question will no doubt be again<br/>agitated—or perhaps
                            sooner.</p>
<p>On the <date when="1808-07-26">twenty-sixth July</date>, I wrote you a
                            short letter,<br/>with the reports of the society for bettering the
                            con-<br/>dition of the poor which have been published since <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_225" n="229"></pb>the former series of reports were sent you. I shall<br/>be
                            glad to hear that they have reached you in safety.<br/>Soon after, I
                            retired with my family for a couple of<br/>months for the benefit of
                            sea-bathing, several of them<br/>having enjoyed bad health for a
                            considerable length<br/>of time, and 1 found a little relaxation
                            necessary for<br/>myself, in consequence of the fatigues of
                            business.<br/>I brought as usual with me, your letters, with
                            many<br/>others, which the pressure of public business in town<br/>would
                            not permit me to attend to; and these, with<br/>my daily correspondents
                            on official and other busi-<br/>ness, joined to some important state
                            papers, which<br/>required to be drawn up by me with that degree
                            of<br/>attention which could be best done in solitude, has<br/>kept me
                            constantly employed. I am happy to say,<br/>that my family are
                            considerably improved in health,<br/>and I feel myself better of the
                            country air, necessary<br/>at my time of life, being now in my
                            sixty-fourth year,<br/> and not enjoying very good health.</p>
<p><a href="/people/heddy1">Mrs. Eddy<persname key="heddy1"></persname></a> has not called on me as 1
                            expected she<br/>would do, and the truth is, that having received
                            your<br/> letter when at Brighton last year, and endorsing it<br/>with
                            other letters which did not require an immedi-<br/>ate reply, and having
                            a great deal of business on my<br/>hands after my return home, I was
                            prevented from<br/> referring to it, and under the pressure of other
                            affairs<br/>it totally escaped me; but 1 have now taken
                                down<br/><a href="/people/heddy1">Mrs. Eddy<persname key="heddy1"></persname></a>'s direction in

                            a vacant<br/>hour (of which I have very few) 1 will make a point<br/>of
                            calling upon her, and shall rejoice to have it in my<br/>power to render
                            her any acceptable services, either<br/>by my advice or otherwise.</p>
<p>On the subject of the Brantingham Tract, I have<br/>addressed a separate

<p> A number of benevolent persons of the city of<br/><a href="/places/hartf">Hartford<placename key="hartf"></placename></a>, in <a href="/places/connt">Connecticut<placename key="connt"></placename></a>, have formed an association,<br/>with a

<p> I do not know who wrote the view of our state<br/>prison; it appears to

                            now conducted<br/>by persons who are very capable of managing
                            its<br/>concerns. The great benefits derived to the public,<br/>by the
                            alterations of our present system, is acknow-<br/>ledged by all our
                            citizens, and similar establishments<br/>of prisons have taken place in
                            almost every state.</p>

<salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p> It was pleasing to me to receive a letter from thee,<br/>with the
                            testimony of thy continued remembrance<br/>and regard; and it afforded
                            me additional satisfac-<br/>tion to believe, that as life advances, and
                            its close<br/> approaches, thy solicitude for the welfare of thy
                            fel-<br/>low creatures, and a preparation for thy own final<br/>well
                            being, is more and more ardent and impressive.<br/>A little longer
                            period will manifest to us both, the<br/> infinite importance of this
                            solicitude and preparation.</p>
<p>I am pleased to perceive by thy letter, that many<br/>of you at
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, are deeply interested
                            in pro-<br/>moting the recovery and relief of insane persons; and<br/>I
                            hope you will be encouraged in the pursuit of this<br/>benevolent and
                            good work.</p>
<p>I did not know how I could better answer thy<br/>views and wishes,
                            respecting your proposed asylum,<br/>than by putting thy pamphlet and
                            letter into the<br/> hands of my benevolent and zealous friend,
                                <a href="/people/stuke1">SamuelTuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a>, who has paid
                            great attention to this subject;<br/>and I am gratified with introducing
                            you to the<br/>acquaintance of each other.</p>
<p>Thy request to me respecting the plan for an asy-<br/>lum, came very
                            seasonably. The magistrates for the<br/>West Riding of <a href="/places/yorks">Yorkshire<placename key="yorks"></placename></a>, intending to erect an
                            insti-<br/>tution for pauper lunatics, advertised for plans,
                            and<br/>gave out correspondent instructions. The result was,<br/>the
                            production of a great number and variety of<br/>plans. That one which
                            obtained the preference and<br/>the highest premium, thou will find
                            delineated in<br/>the <q>Practical Hints</q> of <a href="/people/stuke1">Samuel Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a>, which I send<br/>to thee with this letter.
                            This pamphlet was very<br/>lately published, and was composed by him, to
                            satisfy<br/>the justices on several important points; and I
                            believe<br/>it received their warm approbation. The work will,<br/> I
                            doubt not, be very gratifying to thee. Thou will<br/>perceive that, in
                            order to adapt the plan to your<br/>views at <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, he has introduced into it some <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_228" n="232"></pb>modifications. On the whole, I venture to presume,<br/>that the
                                <q>Practical Hints,</q> the letter of my friend<br/><a href="/people/stuke1">Samuel Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a> to thee, and the modified plan
                            of the<br/>intended Wakefield Asylum, will very materially<br/>assist
                            you in adopting such a building and establish-<br/>ment, as will answer
                            the end you have in view.</p>
<p>I have pleasure in being the instrument of convey-<br/>ing to thee these
                            subjects of information; and remain</p>

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Inclosed is the copy of a letter, addressed by me<br/>to <a href="/people/bblee1">Barent Bleecker<persname key="bblee1"></persname></a>, of <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>. I beg to claim thy<br/>attention to the subject
                            of this letter, and if, in thy<br/>opinion, it would be advisable for
                            the Board of Direc-<br/>tors of our Canal Company to offer a memorial
                            to<br/>the legislature, embracing the several matters con-<br/>tained in
                            the letter, it is probable it will be adopted<br/>by the Board; if any
                            thing further occurs to thy<br/>mind on the subject, please inform
                            me.</p>
<p>Thou wilt recollect that, when I had the pleasure<br/>of seeing thee at
                                <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, we agreed, that it
                            would<br/>be highly proper for the people in the western part<br/>of the
                            State, to send to the legislature, this winter, a<br/>memorial, urging
                            in strong terms the necessity of<br/>adopting some plan, for improving
                            the internal navi-<br/>gation of this State, by means of Canals,

                            forward, and by a<br/>memorial press the subject on the legislature,
                            we<br/> shall not be likely to get any thing done. Please<br/>write me

<p>My friend, <a href="/people/jcolt1">Judah Colt<persname key="jcolt1"></persname></a>, Esq. of

                            may<br/>serve to show to thy friends, as you are all
                            equally<br/>interested in the subject alluded to in the

                            will jointly<br/>adopt some plan, to excite an interest in the

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have had considerable conversation with our<br/>mutual friend,
                                <a href="/people/jcolt1">Judah Colt<persname key="jcolt1"></persname></a>, Esq. of the town of

                            proposed <geogname key="eriec">Canal</geogname> from <geogname key="lakee">Erie</geogname> to<br/>the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname>, and being extremely desirous of know-<br/>ing
                            the sentiments of the citizens of your State rela-<br/>ting to a plan,
                            that appears to me, so interesting to<br/>you as well as to us, I take
                            the liberty, in conformity<br/>to the recommendation of my friend
                                <a href="/people/jcolt1">Colt<persname key="jcolt1"></persname></a>, to crave of<br/>thee, to
                            give me such information as may be in thy<br/>power. I have been, for
                            twenty years, a Director in<br/>the West Inland Canal Company of this
                            State, and<br/>have frequently visited our western country; and
                            as<br/>one of the Commissioners appointed by our legisla-<br/>ture, for
                            the consideration of all matters relating to<br/>the improvement of the
                            internal navigation of the<br/>State, I explored in company with the
                            said Com-<br/>missioners all our western waters, as far as <a href="/places/lakee">LakeErie<placename key="lakee"></placename></a>. I mention these
                            circumstances, merely to<br/>account for the zeal I may discover, in
                            wishing to<br/>promote an object of the highest importance,
                            and<br/>incalculable value, as it regards the state of <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and most of the other States
                            in the Union.<br/>No person who has sufficiently reflected on the
                            sub-<br/>ject, would hesitate one moment on account of the<br/>cost, as
                            it is a well known fact, that the resources of<br/>this State alone, are
                            fully equal to the undertaking.<br/>During the late war, the subject of
                            course did not<br/>command much public attention, but since we
                            have<br/>enjoyed the blessings of peace, the minds of most of<br/>our
                            citizens appear to be anxious to have it accom-<br/>plished. Still we
                            shall have many difficulties to en-<br/>counter—with the timid, who are
                            afraid of the expense<br/>—and the ignorant, who are incapable of
                            apprecia-<br/>ting its importance and advantages. I have lately<br/>
                            received a letter from a gentleman, who resides on the<br/><geogname key="alleg">Allegany River</geogname> in this State, who states he
                            has lately<br/>been in the State of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, as far as the <geogname key="ohiof">falls of the
                                    <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_231" n="235"></pb>Ohio</geogname>, and that your citizens appear
                            to take a very<br/>decided part in favour of promoting the
                            contemplated<br/> connexion of the waters of <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogname> with the <geogname key="hudsr">Hud-<br/>son
                                River</geogname>; and he adds, that many persons expressed<br/>an
                            anxious desire, that your legislature should make<br/>a communication to
                            our legislature on the subject,<br/>stating the great advantages that
                            would be afforded<br/>to the State of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, if this grand project was<br/>once accommplished.
                            On this I crave to remark, and<br/>beg thy particular attention. If your
                            legislature<br/>could be induced to make such a communication,<br/>there
                            is not the least doubt to be entertained, but<br/>that it would have so
                            much weight with our legis-<br/>lature, as to induce them immediately to
                            commence<br/>the work. It is true, the commissioners, as well<br/>as
                            others, have endeavoured to make the legislature<br/>understand, that
                            the <geogname key="eriec">Canal</geogname> of course would draw<br/>
                            your trade to <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, but owing to
                            a want of<br/>knowledge of the geography of the country, they
                            are,<br/>many of them, incapable of forming a correct judg-<br/>ment on
                            the subject. It will then be readily con-<br/>ceived, how much it might
                            enlighten their minds,<br/>and influence their judgments, if a suitable
                            commu-<br/>nication was made in the manner before mentioned.<br/>I beg
                            leave to refer this part of the subject to thy<br/>serious attention,
                            and possibly it may correspond<br/>with thy views, to use thy influence,
                            and unite it<br/>with other influential characters in your State,
                            to<br/>introduce it before your legislature. Our sessions<br/>commence
                            at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> in <date when="1816-01">January</date>. Congress have<br/>large tracts of land in your
                            State—suppose your<br/>legislature should apply for a grant of a portion
                            of<br/> land, expressly for the purpose of promoting the
                            com-<br/>pletion of the <geogname key="eriec">Canal</geogname>, and then
                            you were to offer it to<br/>the legislature of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, on condition that the citi-<br/>zens and
                            produce of the State of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>, should
                            pass<br/>through the <geogname key="eriec">Canal</geogname> and Locks
                            without paying toll.<br/>This is offered as a hint for your examination;
                            you<br/>are more capable of judging as to the mode and man-<br/>

                            should he concluded, that such a communication<br/>ought to be made, it
                            would have an incalculable good<br/>effect, if it could be presented to
                            our legislature<br/>about the time that the Commissioners offer
                            their<br/>annual report. This may be done, if your legisla-<br/>ture

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I was favoured, about ten days ago, with your<br/>letter of the <date when="1815-11-28">28th ultimo</date>, enclosing the copy of
                            one<br/>from you, of a prior date, to Mr. <a href="/people/bblee1">Barent
                                Bleecker<persname key="bblee1"></persname></a>.</p>
<p>The shortness of the days, and the pressure of my<br/>agency business,
                            with some other circumstances, not<br/>necessary to be mentioned, have
                            prevented me from<br/>returning you an earlier answer.</p>
<p>As yet, I have received no communication from<br/>Mr. <a href="/people/bwrig1">Wright<persname key="bwrig1"></persname></a>, on the subject of the memorial,
                            which<br/>he was to set on foot, at <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>, and other places.</p>
<p>Last week there was a meeting of the Directors<br/>of the Seneca Canal
                            Company, in this village; and<br/>I embraced the opportunity, which the
                            meeting<br/>afforded, of consulting the Directors on the
                            expediency<br/>of the proposed <geogname key="eriec">Canal</geogname>,
                            from <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/salin">Salina<placename key="salin"></placename></a>. I found<br/>them unanimously of opinion, that
                            the measure was<br/>well calculated to improve the navigation—that
                            it<br/>ought to be zealously pursued—and that they
                            would<br/>individually contribute their best endeavours to pro-<br/>mote
                            its success.</p>
<p>The work of canalling the <geogname key="senef">Seneca Falls</geogname>,
                            is pro-<br/>gressing with every prospect of being completed by <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_233" n="237"></pb><date when="1816-10">next October</date>, if sufficient
                            additional funds can be<br/>procured for the purpose. The contractor for
                            the<br/> work is a <a href="/people/mlewi1">Mr. Marshal Lewis<persname key="mlewi1"></persname></a>;
                            this gentleman seems<br/>to unite rare talents, with uncommon
                            application,<br/>and exemplary integrity; and he has thus
                            far<br/>brought forward the work in a style supposed to<br/>surpass, as
                            well in durability as in appearance, any<br/>canal work in the United
                            States. This fortunate<br/> result, however, is in great part to be
                            ascribed to a<br/>species of stone, discovered by <a href="/people/mlewi1">Mr. Lewis<persname key="mlewi1"></persname></a>, at the head<br/>of the <geogname key="senec">Seneca Lake</geogname>; which is taken from the quarry<br/>in large
                            masses, is of a blueish colour, and though of<br/>solid texture, yet it
                            is sufficiently soft to yield, with<br/>ease, to the stroke of the
                            hammer. <a href="/people/mlewi1">Mr. Lewis<persname key="mlewi1"></persname></a> has<br/>gone so far
                            beyond his contract, in the good quality<br/>of his work, that the sum
                            he is to receive will fall<br/>near ten thousand dollars short of what
                            is requisite<br/>to finish it; to supply which deficiency the
                            Directors<br/>intend to apply to the liberality of the legislature.</p>
<p>All our accounts from the settlers in the neigh-<br/>bourhood of
                                <geogname key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogname>, and from the traders
                            re-<br/>siding within our territory, but doing more or less<br/>business
                            in <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, agree that the British
                            have their<br/>eyes wide open, to the importance of the trade
                            of<br/>this country, and are adopting measures to secure it.<br/>Among
                            other means, they have put in train the build-<br/>ing of steam boats on
                            the <geogname key="lakeo">Lake</geogname>, to carry freight to<br/>and
                            from <a href="/places/fwell">Fort Wellington<placename key="fwell"></placename></a>, late <a href="/places/presc">Prescott<placename key="presc"></placename></a>; and they<br/>are, moreover,
                            contemplating the improvement of the<br/>navigation of the <geogname key="stlar">St. Lawrence</geogname>, by canalling the<br/>rapids;
                            which, it is said, will not be a very difficult<br/>undertaking.</p>
<p>Such being the policy of the British, it behooves<br/>our state to wake
                            from its slumber—to be active,<br/>and to strain every sinew of its
                            ability, to counter-<br/>act it. I need not observe, on the almost
                            wonderful<br/>increase of wealth, which the state would derive<br/>from
                            a constant and uninterrupted flow of the pro-<br/>ducts of this large
                            and fertile district, into the cities <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_234" n="238"></pb>of <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. The very idea of part-<br/>ing with this
                            wealth, by suffering the products to<br/>be carried to <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, there to nourish and
                            fatten<br/>the commerce of a rival nation, cannot fail to excite<br/>
                            painful reflections in the minds of every man whose<br/>heart is warmed
                            with the love of country. I say,<br/>that the state ought to strain
                            every nerve of its ability,<br/>to counteract the policy of the British,
                            because the<br/> magnitude of the object utterly forbids all hope
                            of<br/>accomplishing it by the money contributions
                            of<br/>individuals</p>
<p>What renders it more imperiously the duty of the<br/>state to interpose
                            with its ability, is the absolute neces-<br/>sity of regulating the
                            rates of toll by a scale so mode-<br/>rate, as to make the expense of
                            transportation to <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a><br/>palpably
                            less than the expense of transportation to<br/><a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>. This is the grand desideratum to be
                            aimed<br/>at in every scheme for improving the Lake
                            navigation<br/>between the Lakes and <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson's
                                River</geogname>. If the expense<br/>of carriage to <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> exceeds the expense of car-<br/>riage
                            to <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, the trader will be sure
                            to send his<br/>produce to the latter only ; and, if the expense
                            be<br/>equal, he will be apt to do the same, in as much as<br/>the Lake,
                            and its outlet, form the natural highway<br/>for conveying the products
                            of this country to an<br/> Atlantic market, and the use of this highway
                            is at-<br/>tended with less trouble and risk, and with
                            greater<br/>despatch. At all times, and under all circumstances,<br/>it
                            is difficult to change the course of nature, with<br/> success; and, in
                            the present case, it can only be done<br/>by giving the trader a deep
                            interest in preferring the<br/>Eastern to the Northern route.</p>
<p> The expense of transporting a barrel of flour from<br/>this village to
                                <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a>, is one dollar and
                            seventy-five<br/>cents; whereas the expense of transportation
                                to<br/><a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> is two dollars and
                            fifty cents; and, as long<br/>as this difference continues, <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a> will be likely<br/>to maintain a
                            successful competition with <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>
                                and<br/><a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. </p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_235" n="239"></pb>
<p>You will readily perceive, my dear sir, from what<br/>has been said, that
                            I place no confidence whatever,<br/>in the power of any company,
                            incorporated on the<br/>basis of private credit, to rescue us from the
                            criminal<br/>act of permitting the British to sever from the body<br/>of
                            our commerce what may be truly called its right<br/>arm. I conceive that
                            the stream of our western<br/> trade can only be forced into the
                                <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname> by the<br/>mighty power of
                            our legislature. It is, therefore,<br/>my clear opinion, that it will be
                            the true policy of<br/>our company to lay the axe to the root of the
                            evil,<br/>by going to the legislature with a frank and
                            manly<br/>memorial, representing the immense value of our<br/>western
                            trade—the measures which the British ap-<br/>pear to be contemplating to
                            monopolize it—the high<br/>importance of defeating those measures—the
                            utter<br/>impracticability of effecting this great object, by
                            the<br/>efforts of any incorporated companies, relying on the<br/>funds
                            and credit of individuals—and praying the<br/>legislature to put in
                            requisition its vast resources,<br/>and by exerting them, to save the
                            state from the dis-<br/>honour and the mischiefs it will incur, by
                            sitting<br/> with folded arms, and seeing the dismemberment of<br/>its
                            commerce.</p>
<p>I have it in purpose immediately to begin draw-<br/>ing a memorial to the
                            legislature, corresponding with<br/>the sentiments herein expressed, and
                            to put it into<br/>general circulation for signatures.</p>

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I have been absent a few days, at <a href="/places/canan">Canandai-gua<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, which has prevented my attention to
                            the impor-<br/>tant business of improving our canal navigation.<br/>Last
                            night we had a meeting of the citizens of this<br/>village, and we
                            agreed on a petition to the legisla-<br/>ture, and appointed a committee
                            of correspondence,<br/>to communicate with the other towns in this
                            county,<br/>and with the towns in the other counties more
                            im-<br/>mediately interested in the navigation. I think we<br/>shall, by
                            our proceedings, put this county in motion.</p>
<p>We have just learnt the proceedings in <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>,<br/>on the subject of the canal, and are much
                            gratified<br/>to find they are alive to the importance of another<br/>
                            application to the legislature.</p>
<p>Now is the accepted time—now is the day for adopt-<br/>ing, and carrying
                            into effect, a policy which is likely<br/>to be productive of
                            incalculable advantages to the<br/>commerce of our state.</p>
<p>I hope our friends in <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> will also
                            be awaken-<br/>ed to see their interest, and that our applications
                            to<br/> the legislature will also be sanctioned with one<br/>from the
                            great body of its citizens.</p>
<p>Our proceedings are in the hands of the printer;<br/>and as soon as they
                            are published, I will send you a<br/>copy of them. It may be pleasing to

                            to see that, in this country,<br/>we are not unmindful of our duty to

<salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have been favoured with your letter of the <date when="1816-02-03">3d<br/>instant</date>, and I am not a little pleased at
                            learning,<br/>that our Western Lock Navigation Company, has <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_237" n="241"></pb>lately so much improved in strength, as, not only
                            to<br/>walk, but even to run, nearly as fast as any of the<br/>bank
                            companies; in proof of which, I readily admit<br/>a declared dividend of
                            eight per cent, for the last<br/>year, to be very good evidence.</p>
<p>We sent our circular letters, with copies of our<br/>proceedings, to
                                <a href="/places/bwrig1">Mr. Wright<placename key="bwrig1"></placename></a>, <a href="/people/jgedd1">Mr. Geddes<persname key="jgedd1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jform1">Mr.

                            the <date when="1816-02-06">6th<br/>instant</date>, I received a letter
                            from <a href="/people/bwrig1">Mr. Wright<persname key="bwrig1"></persname></a>, dated
                                at<br/><a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>, on the <date when="1816-02-03">3d instant</date>, in which he says, <said who="bwrig1">When<br/>I had the pleasure of seeing you in <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, in <date when="1815-11">No-<br/>vember</date>, I promised to write upon the subject of

                                to<br/>exertions; and, yesterday, Mr. <a href="/people/ghunt1">G.
                                    Huntington<persname key="ghunt1"></persname></a>, and<br/>myself, made a visit to
                                    <a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a>, for the purpose
                                of<br/> meeting the gentlemen there, and conferring on<br/>this very
                                important subject. Those gentlemen met<br/>us, and a rough draft of
                                a memorial was drawn<br/>up, and will be circulated rapidly, and
                                soon be laid<br/>before the legislature.</said></p>
<p>From this extract it appears that <a href="/people/bwrig1">Mr.
                                Wright<persname key="bwrig1"></persname></a>, and<br/>his friends, were in a profound sleep,
                            until awak-<br/>ened by the proceedings in <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and in this<br/>village.</p>
<p>I fear there is too much apathy every where, in<br/>regard to this great
                            state object; and that I shall be<br/>disappointed in my expectations of
                            the quantity of<br/>public opinion that will be carried into the
                            legisla-<br/>ture. We are collecting the petitions, circulated
                            for<br/>signature in this neighbourhood, and, in a day or<br/>two, they
                            will be forwarded to <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>.<br/>The
                            expense that would attend the appointment<br/>of a committee to go to
                                <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, and there act
                            as<br/>lobby members, in favour of the canal, utterly for-<br/>bids the
                            adoption of such a measure in this county.</p>
<p>I think I shall be able to procure the information<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_238" n="242"></pb>you
                            wish, relative to the canal work at the <geogname key="senef">Seneca<br/>Falls</geogname>; and I shall, accordingly, apply for

                            to you.</p>
<p> I cannot express to you, in terms sufficiently strong,<br/>my grateful

                            but I assure you, it is my<br/>solemn belief, that if the legislature
                            should not be<br/>able to rise so far above the paltry considerations
                            of<br/>party spirit, and local interests, as to come to a level<br/>with

<salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>By direction of the Governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New-York
                                Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, I now send the petition, annual report,
                            and<br/> annual account of patients admitted and discharged,<br/>for the
                            year <date when="1815">1815</date>. The House (as customary)
                            will,<br/>on a motion being made for that purpose, order
                            these<br/>documents to be printed. The printed account of<br/>patients
                            will be tedious, and take much time; I<br/>would, therefore, take the
                            liberty to suggest to thee,<br/>to direct the printer to serve each
                            member with the<br/><emph rend="italic">Petition</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Report</emph>, immediately as they are printed.<br/>I
                            mention this, as it is important to bring the busi-<br/>ness before the
                            legislature, before other business<br/>crowd on them.</p>
<p>Our cause is a noble one, and I cannot but enter-<br/>tain full
                            confidence, that our application will be<br/>favourably received, and
                            acted on with promptness,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_239" n="243"></pb>and a spirit of liberality. I
                            believe thou wilt agree<br/>with me, that we ought not to expect a sum
                            sufficient<br/>to erect all the necessary buildings (say
                            $70,000)<br/>would readily be granted us, but I am of opinion<br/>they
                            would cheerfully allow us $10,000 a year, to be<br/>paid out of the fund
                            arising out of the sales of goods<br/>sold at vendue; and, they may more
                            readily do this,<br/>as the amount from this source, for <date when="1815">1815</date>, will be<br/><emph rend="italic">very</emph>
                            considerable. A part of this fund is to be paid<br/>to our corporation
                            for the support of foreign poor,<br/>some of <emph rend="italic">this
                                part</emph> might possibly be diverted for our<br/>use, <emph rend="italic">if we cannot otherwise succeed</emph>.</p>
<p>If we could complete this establishment, <emph rend="italic">all</emph>
                            the<br/>insane in the <emph rend="italic">state</emph> might be
                            accommodated; and<br/>the number at this moment in the several
                            counties<br/> must be very considerable. If this city contains
                            one<br/>tenth of the inhabitants of the whole state, and has<br/>one
                            hundred and twenty lunatics, the number in<br/>the country must be very
                            great; but, it is very pos-<br/>sible, it may not be in the same
                            proportion, owing<br/>to the use of spirituous liquors being more
                            prevalent<br/>in the city than in the country.</p>
<p>If we could obtain 10,000 dollars a year, I would<br/>propose, that the
                            Governors should open a loan, to<br/>borrow 70,000 dollars, at six per
                            cent; this would<br/>require 4,200 dollars to pay the interest, and
                            the<br/>remainder, 5,800, might be appropriated towards the<br/>expense
                            of supporting the establishment. If we can<br/>obtain this annuity, it
                            will be highly important that<br/>we should have it for as <emph rend="italic">long</emph> a period as possible.<br/>Suppose (in
                            order to keep the <emph rend="italic">time</emph> out of sight)
                            thee<br/>should move to fill up the blank that will be left in<br/>the
                            draft of the bill, thus: <q>Ten thousand dollars,<br/>annually, in
                                quarter yearly payments, the first quar-<br/>ter to be paid the

                                to<br/>be paid every year hereafter, during the period
                                men-<br/>tioned in the first section of the act, passed <date when="1806-03-14">14th<br/>March, 1806</date>, entitled, <q>an
                                    act for the better and<br/>more permanent support of the

                                        York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,</q> limiting the period for the
                                payment<br/>of an annuity therein expressed.</q></p>
<p>The crowded situation of our state prison makes<br/>it necessary, either
                            to enlarge the present building<br/>or to erect a new one at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/utica">Utica<placename key="utica"></placename></a>, or some other<br/>place.</p>
<p>The plan of the present prison was entirely my<br/>own, and, although I
                            visited <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and
                            ex-<br/>amined many of <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a>'s plans,
                            and was furnished<br/>with several by my friend <a href="/people/wpitt1">William M. Pitt<persname key="wpitt1"></persname></a>, a member<br/>of Parliament for
                            Dorchester, of prisons in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>,<br/>yet a most striking error was committed in
                            our<br/> plan;—it should have contained 500 rooms, 7 feet by<br/>9 feet,
                            in order to keep the prisoners separate at<br/><emph rend="italic">night</emph>—in the <emph rend="italic">day</emph> they are at
                            work, and have keep-<br/>ers constantly with them, so that they have no
                            oppor-<br/>tunity to corrupt each other;—this entirely destroys<br/>the
                            designs of a penitentiary establishment, intended<br/>to amend and
                            improve the habits of the convicts.<br/>A few years since, one of the
                            commissioners appoint-<br/>ed to build a penitentiary at <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a>, came to <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, with a view to get information as to the
                            plan<br/>for them to adopt; I urged them to have a separate<br/>room for
                            each prisoner, and had such a plan drawn<br/>under my direction; this
                            was adopted, and it is the<br/>only prison in this country calculated to
                            answer the<br/>design of forming such establishments. Having so<br/>many
                            rooms, does not increase the expense, as the<br/>prison need not be
                            built so strong, because there is<br/>less danger of escape. If another
                            prison should be<br/> erected, I sincerely hope it may be on the plan
                            of<br/>having a separate room for each convict.</p>
<p>The number of convicts are considerably increased<br/> (at least in this
                            city) on account of the sum which<br/>makes grand larceny—this is twelve
                            dollars and<br/>a half; it was fixed at fifty dollars, it would
                            con-<br/>siderably lessen the number of prisoners in the
                            state<br/>prison. I respectfully offer these hints, as some
                            sub-<br/>ject relating to the state prison, or the existing
                            penal<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_241" n="245"></pb>laws, may be presented to the legislature. I,
                            also<br/>send thee a work published some years ago, contain-<br/>ing an
                            account of the prisons.</p>
<p><a href="/people/dogde1">D. A. Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a>, and others, have purchased

                            they are con-<br/>triving to get the Indians to sell to them for a
                            small<br/>sum; the poor Indians have been always cheated,<br/>except by
                                <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a>, who uniformly done

                            the natives, by which means peace was<br/> preserved in his province,
                            and no war or bloodshed<br/>for seventy years; and this would have
                            continued, if his<br/>grand children, in <date when="1756">1756</date>,
                            had not attempted to cheat<br/>the Indians, in purchasing their land. In
                            short, I am<br/>perfectly satisfied, that in every war that has
                            occur-<br/>red between the whites (Christians!) and Indians,<br/>the
                            former has been aggressors. The condition of<br/>these poor people is
                            shamefully neglected, and is<br/>truly deserving our sympathy and
                            commiseration.<br/>We enjoy, in a full extent, every blessing of
                            Heaven,<br/>on the very land they formerly occupied, in
                            security,<br/>peace, and plenty, as to game, fish, &amp;c.; we have<br/>
                            abundance, whilst they often suffer for want of food,<br/>clothing,
                            &amp;c. Under these considerations, it appears<br/>to me, we ought to do
                            all in our power to meliorate<br/>their condition, to protect them from
                            the violence and<br/>imposition of the white people, and generally to
                            con-<br/>tribute to their comfort and happiness, as far as
                            cir-<br/>cumstances will permit. I will take the liberty to<br/>state
                            hints of a plan, that, in my opinion, might be<br/>productive of lasting
                            benefit to the Indians.</p>
<p>A board of seven or eight commissioners, to be<br/>selected from the
                            different religious societies, and<br/>appointed to take into
                            consideration all matters and<br/> things relative to the Indians within
                            the state, with-<br/>out salary.</p>
<p>1st. To meet annually during the sitting of the<br/>Legislature.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_242" n="246"></pb>
<p>2nd. To appoint a committee of two, who should<br/>visit, yearly, every
                            nation of Indians in the state—<br/>inquire into their situation and
                            wants, improve-<br/>ment in religion and morals, school learning,
                            and<br/>agriculture; and use their best endeavours to prevail<br/>on
                            them to consent to divide their lands into farms<br/>of 100 acres each,
                            not to be alienated or leased, but<br/>to descend to nearest relations,
                            &amp;c.; hear their com-<br/>plaints of whites attempting to defraud
                            them, as to<br/>their lands, &amp;c.; and report to the Board at
                            their<br/>annual meeting.</p>
<p>3d. The Board to employ suitable <emph rend="italic">religious</emph>
                            cha-<br/>racters, to reside among the Indians, to instruct them<br/>in
                            agriculture, the useful arts, and school learning.</p>
<p>4th. The Board to report annually to the Legisla-<br/>ture, and recommend

<p>5th. The Commissioners to be allowed the same<br/>pay (<emph rend="italic">when on duty</emph>) as members of the
                            Legislature.</p>
<p> 6th. To be allowed 3000 dollars yearly, to be ap-<br/>propriated as they
                            might judge proper for the bene-<br/>fit of the several tribes, in order
                            to carry into effect<br/>the design of this plan.</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>We have lately been informed by some of our<br/>friends who reside near
                            the <a href="/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge Indians<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a>,<br/>that
                            near one hundred white persons have settled on<br/>the lands belonging
                            to the said Indians—<said who="undetermined">that,<br/>although they
                                have been proceeded against, as the<br/>law directs, yet, by their
                                influence with the chiefs,<br/>the matter has been so represented to
                                the Governor, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_243" n="247"></pb>that he and the Attorney General
                                have directed<br/> that further proceedings against them be
                                stopped<br/>for the present, and the probability is, that
                                the<br/>chiefs may address the Legislature, requesting a<br/>law to
                                permit them to remain.</said></p>
<p>We are part of a committee of our society, appoint-<br/>ed for the
                            purpose of promoting, among the Indians,<br/>a disposition of
                            improvement in agriculture, and gene-<br/>rally to meliorate their
                            condition; and we have al-<br/>ways found, that they have been
                            exceedingly injured<br/>in their morals, &amp;c. by the whites getting
                            on their<br/>lands, and mixing with them.</p>
<p>From the conferences which some of us have had<br/>with thee, relative to
                            the Indians, we have been in-<br/>duced to believe thou feel an interest
                            in the welfare<br/>of that people, and disposed to exert, not only
                            thy<br/>private influence, as an individual, but thy
                            official<br/>powers, as chief magistrate of the state, in
                            promoting<br/>a redress of any grievances they may labour
                            under—as<br/>well as co-operating with the well meant endeavours<br/>of
                            others, so that every proper step may be taken<br/>which justice and
                            humanity may dictate in the<br/> premises.</p>
<p>We have a confidence that every thing on thy part<br/>has, and will be
                            done, for the welfare of the Indians;<br/>but, as an application may be
                            made by the white<br/>people to the Legislature, for some law to be
                            passed,<br/>by which they may unjustly get an advantage over<br/>the
                            Indians, and as thou art, likely, very much occu-<br/>pied at this time,
                            it is possible the subject may escape<br/>thy memory; and we, therefore,
                            take the liberty to<br/>make the present communication, and respectfully
                            to<br/>solicit a continuation of thy friendly regard, to a
                            de-<br/>scription of our fellow men, who seem incapable of<br/>taking
                            care of their own interest, and whose peculiar<br/>situation and
                            circumstances seem to demand our<br/>sympathy, and require our

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I much fear that I have hitherto omitted to thank<br/>you (which I now do
                            most cordially) for the very<br/>interesting pamphlets, which you had
                            the goodness<br/>to send me by <a href="/people/tgall1">Mr.
                                Gallaudet<persname key="tgall1"></persname></a>, who I had not the plea-<br/>sure of seeing,
                            until after he had received all the<br/>information he required,
                            respecting the institution<br/>established here, for instructing the
                                <emph rend="italic">Deaf</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Dumb</emph>.<br/>I only saw that gentleman for a few moments,
                            while<br/>I was engaged in my magisterial duties on the<br/>bench; and I
                            regretted much that I had not the plea-<br/>sure of seeing him
                            afterwards, as I fully expected,<br/>since it was my wish to have shown
                            him all those<br/>civilities which are justly due to any friend
                            recom-<br/>mended by you.</p>
<p>I had, also, the pleasure of receiving your letter by<br/><a href="/people/jfran1">Doctor Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>, who did me the favour of
                            dining<br/>with me, and which afforded me the opportunity
                            of<br/>introducing him to a very intelligent physician, my<br/>son in
                            law, <a href="/people/gyeat1">Doctor Yates<persname key="gyeat1"></persname></a>, from whom he
                            received<br/>much of that species of information, of which his<br/>very
                            active and intelligent mind was so eagerly in<br/>pursuit. <a href="/people/jfran1">Doctor Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a> has gone to <a href="/places/paris2">Paris<placename key="paris2"></placename></a>, but will<br/>soon return, when I
                            shall be happy to show him<br/>every attention in my power.</p>
<p>Among other philanthropic establishments which<br/>are yearly rising in
                            the great metropolis, we are<br/> now anxiously engaged in forming <emph rend="italic">a Provident In-<br/>stitution</emph>, or <emph rend="italic">Saving Bank</emph>, in the western district of<br/>the
                            city, upon the principle suggested and explained<br/>in my Treatise on
                            Indigence, published in <date when="1806">1806</date>, but<br/>on a far
                            more limited scale. The practical effect<br/>of these establishments,
                            was first manifested in <a href="/places/scot">Scot-land<placename key="scot"></placename></a>, since which they have been extended to
                            several<br/>towns in England, and are likely to become <emph rend="italic">very<br/>general</emph>. Their utility scarcely
                            requires explanation.<br/>The object is, to assist the labouring poor to
                            preserve<br/>a portion of their earnings for old age, and to
                            give<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_245" n="249"></pb>them provident habits. I send you, under
                            cover, the<br/>plan of our institution, which has just
                            commenced,<br/>and which has been the result of much discussion<br/>and
                            deliberation. When <a href="/people/jfran1">Doctor Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>
                            returns, I<br/>shall trouble him with a few of such publications
                            as<br/>you may wish to possess. My various occupations,<br/>joined to an
                            advanced period of life, render me less<br/>able than I could wish, to
                            take an active share in<br/>the management of many institutions of a
                            charitable<br/>nature, to which I must be satisfied only to be
                            a<br/>contributor. Many of them are excellent, while not<br/>a few have
                            been established without the aid of that<br/> caution and good judgment
                            which is calculated to<br/>produce utility, which tends to reduce the
                            funds of<br/>others, whose beneficial efforts are obvious and
                            cer-<br/>tain; and hence it is, that much money is expended<br/> where
                            little practical benefit results. Our Free<br/>Schools, for the
                            education of the poor, are now be-<br/>come very general all over the
                            country, which, I trust,<br/>will give a new and improved character to
                            the rising<br/>generation among the poor, which is so much want-<br/>ed

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Thy very kind favour of <date when="1815-09-17">9th mo. 17th</date>, was
                            receiv-<br/>ed some time since—its interesting details have<br/>afforded
                            considerable satisfaction, and, with the work<br/>on the constitution of
                            Lunatic Asylums, will be highly<br/>useful to us. I should have replied
                            to thy letter sooner<br/>than this date, but the Governors having
                            applied to<br/> our Legislature for aid towards completing the
                            pro-<br/>posed establishment, I waited to know the result, in<br/>order
                            that I might inform thee. I have now the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_246" n="250"></pb>pleasure of
                            stating, that a law was passed, <date when="1816-05-17">17th
                            ult</date>.<br/>to pay the Governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New-York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, ten<br/>thousand dollars a year, in
                            quarter yearly payments,<br/>for and during the term of forty-one years.
                            This<br/>generous and liberal grant, is fully equal to our
                            ex-<br/>pectations, and will be amply sufficient to enable us<br/>to
                            erect extensive buildings, and every other improve-<br/>ment. We
                            purchased thirty-eight acres of land, six<br/>miles from the city—it is
                            on high ground, and com-<br/>mands a most delightful and very extensive
                            view of<br/>the village of <a href="/places/harle">Haerlem<placename key="harle"></placename></a>,
                                <a href="/places/longi">Long Island<placename key="longi"></placename></a>, and the
                            surround-<br/>ing country. As to health, and good water, it is<br/>equal
                            to any in the state of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. Some
                            have<br/>fears, that it is too far from the city; but on
                            that<br/>account, it appears to me, there is no cause to be<br/>afraid
                            that it will not be duly inspected—it is true,<br/>the Governors all
                            reside in the city, but in the vicinity<br/>of the premises there are a
                            number of very respecta-<br/>ble suitable persons, (members of the
                            Corporation of<br/>the Hospital) who would very cheerfully
                            undertake<br/>the charge of visiting, &amp;c. so humane an
                            institution.</p>
<p>Several of the Governors have seats in the neigh-<br/>bourhood, and are
                            out one half the year. It is pro-<br/>posed, the intended building shall
                            accommodate two<br/>hundred patients, calculated for all ranks of
                            life—as<br/> well those of affluent as indigent circumstances,
                            and,<br/>also, paupers, who are supported by the city, and
                            the<br/>respective counties throughout the state—the latter<br/>to be
                            paid for at the rate of two dollars per week,<br/> and others from three
                            to ten dollars, according to<br/>their circumstances, and the
                            accommodations they<br/>may require.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if it is well conducted, and managed<br/>with prudence, it
                            will, not only essentially serve, and<br/>be a great blessing to the
                            state at large, but may be<br/>very profitable, and produce a
                            considerable revenue<br/>to our hospital. I have no doubt, we shall have
                            it<br/>full in two years after it is ready to receive patients.<br/>On
                            one part of the premises there is abundance of<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_247" n="251"></pb>valuable
                            good stone, but it may not be of a suitable<br/>or handsome quality, to
                            make a good face for the<br/>front or outside walls; if so, I was
                            thinking we may<br/>put on a coat of rough cast, or plaster—this has
                            been<br/>done on some of our public buildings, but, in
                            some<br/>instances, it is apt to peel, or fall off, owing
                            (likely)<br/>to severe frosts, or the want of knowing how to make<br/>a
                            strong and good cement. In the north of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>,<br/>and, I believe, in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, they make a plaster that<br/>would stand our
                            climate, and would answer the pur-<br/>pose effectually. I have been
                            told they mix tarras,<br/>(which we have imported from <a href="/places/amst">Amsterdam<placename key="amst"></placename></a>,) or<br/>Welsh lime, that is
                            considerably exported from <a href="/places/brist2">Bris-tol<placename key="brist2"></placename></a>. If thou could procure for me a receipt,
                            from<br/>some distinguished mechanic, to make a suitable plas-<br/>ter
                            that would answer the purpose, it might very<br/>much serve us, and I
                            should esteem it as a particular<br/>favour. It is not probable we shall
                            do more this<br/>year, than lay the foundation of the building.
                            The<br/>remarks in thy letter to me, and thy work, entitled,<br/>Hints
                            on the construction of Lunatic Asylums, will<br/>very much assist us in
                            forming our plan, and when<br/>this is drawn, and concluded on, I
                            propose sending<br/>thee a copy, in hopes thou wilt furnish us with
                            thy<br/>observations for our government in improving of it.</p>
<p>If any thing farther occurs to thee, that would pro-<br/>bably improve
                            our plan, or aid us in executing it, I<br/>should be much obliged by thy
                            communications.<br/>Do be pleased to present my wife's love, in the
                            most<br/> affectionate manner, in which I most heartily unite,<br/>to
                            Ann Alexander, and very particularly to our be-<br/>loved friends,
                                <a href="/people/lmurr1">Lindley Murray<persname key="lmurr1"></persname></a> and wife. I

<salute>MY GOOD FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I scarce know how to begin this letter, as I feel<br/>ashamed and
                            mortified that I have so long neglected<br/>replying to thy last very
                            acceptable communication.</p>
<p>I rejoice to find such a number of your good people<br/>in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> are engaged so devotedly in
                            improving<br/>the condition of the lower classes in society;
                            your<br/>Bible Society, and the immense sums raised for the<br/>poor,
                            who have suffered by the calamity of war on<br/>the continent, is truly
                            astonishing, and I sincerely<br/>trust and believe, will procure the
                            blessing of Divine<br/>Providence on your nation. The communications of
                            the<br/> British and Foreign Bible Society, show that
                            genuine<br/>religion is held in veneration, in many parts of
                            the<br/>continent, to a much greater extent than many here-<br/>tofore
                            believed. I trust it will yet appear more fully<br/>in <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a>, notwithstanding that deluded nation
                            seem-<br/>ed to have been dead as to any sense of it. As the<br/>spirit
                            of our most holy religion spreads over the<br/>world, the condition of
                            mankind will be meliorated—<br/>the minds of men will be softened,
                            instead of being<br/> filled with bitterness, revenge, and hatred—they
                            will<br/>learn of Christ to love each other, and thus, in God's<br/>own
                            time, an end be put to war and bloodshed.<br/>Owing to the late war, the
                            morals of the people of this<br/> country have been (as was reasonably
                            to be expected)<br/>much injured. Notwithstanding this, there is a
                            ge-<br/>neral religious improvement evidently increasing<br/>amongst all
                            denominations of Christians—so that I<br/> entertain a hope, which, I
                            trust, is well grounded,<br/>that, on the whole, we are growing better.
                            Bible<br/>Societies are established in all directions of the
                            United<br/>States, except Virginia, and other slave states,*<br/>
<note rend="asterisk">* In most of these states, Auxiliary Bible
                                Societies have since been estab-<br/>lished.</note> and<br/>great
                            attention is paid to schools, and otherwise to<br/>improve the state of
                            the common people.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_249" n="253"></pb>
<p>Prisons, on the plan of our state prison, are estab-<br/>lished nearly in
                            every state. The affairs of our<br/>prisons have been, ef late years,
                            sadly mismanaged,<br/>otherwise the avails of the labour of the
                            convicts<br/>would be sufficient to defray the annual expenses.</p>
<p>I have been, for some time, much engaged in im-<br/>proving a plan of an
                            establishment for the accommo-<br/>dation of insane persons; the mode of
                            treatment that<br/>ought to be pursued, (and which was
                            recommended<br/>by me to the Governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New-York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>,<br/>in <date when="1815-04">April
                                last year</date>, of which communication I now<br/>send a copy) is
                            the one adopted at the Retreat, by the<br/>Society of Friends, near
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>The Governors have purchased thirty-eight acres<br/>of land, about six
                            miles from the city, and propose<br/>to erect a building to accommodate
                            two hundred<br/>lunatic patients—the thirty-eight acres to be
                            divided,<br/>and laid out in walks, gardens, &amp;c. for the
                            amuse-<br/>ment and exercise of the patients who are fit to
                            par-<br/>take of useful employment and recreation. Our<br/>Legislature
                            has acted very liberally, and generously<br/>granted us 10,000 dollars a
                            year, payable quarterly;<br/>one half of this sum will enable us to make
                            a loan<br/>of 80,000 dollars, so that we shall have very ample<br/>funds
                            for erecting suitable buildings, and making<br/>every necessary
                            improvement. I send thee the last<br/>Report of the Governors, which
                            contains a memorial to<br/>the Legislature on the subject, and fully
                            explains the<br/>plan we propose to pursue. About a month ago,
                            I<br/>attended the Legislature, at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, for the purpose<br/>of aiding our application,
                            and obtained the loan<br/>alluded to, granting us the above-mentioned
                            annuity,<br/>for and during the term of forty-one years.</p>
<p>It is a considerable time since, that I met with, in<br/> the Quarterly
                            Review, an account of thy very impor-<br/>tant publication on the
                            wealth, power, resources, &amp;c.<br/>of the British nation, and I have
                            been extremely<br/>anxious to procure a copy; it is highly spoken of
                            by<br/>those who have met with it in England, and it is<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_250" n="254"></pb>wonderfully strange, that I cannot meet with a single<br/>copy in this
                            city, or <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/organizations/nyfss">Free School Society<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>, under the
                            patronage of<br/>the state, is in a flourishing situation; we have
                            two<br/>schools under our care in this city, containing about<br/>one
                            thousand scholars; we have ample funds, and<br/>propose to erect two
                            other school houses next year.</p>
<p>There are now a school in every town in each of<br/>the counties
                            throughout the state, all under the<br/>patronage of the state; the sum
                            of 60,000 dollars is<br/>now divided among them, according to the
                            number<br/>of scholars in each school, and this fund, in a
                            few<br/>years, will reach 200,000 dollars; besides this, they<br/>are
                            obliged, each town, to raise, by tax, a sum equal<br/>to what they
                            respectively receive from the state.</p>
<p>I shall esteem it as a very particular favour, if thou<br/>will be so
                            good as to continue thy correspondence on<br/>the general state and
                            improvements of the numerous<br/> benevolent establishments in
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>It is owing to thy very valuable correspondence<br/>with me, that our
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> Free School is in
                            so<br/>flourishing a situation as it is at present, and that the<br/>
                            condition of the poor, in many respects, have been<br/>considerably
                            improved.</p>
<p>I am, with the warmest sentiments of esteem and<br/>regard, thy
                            affectionate friend,</p>

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>On the <date when="1816-06-03">3d instant</date>, I had the pleasure of
                            receiv-<br/>ing your esteemed and acceptable letter of the <date when="1816-05-05">5th<br/>ultimo</date>.—No doubt can be entertained
                            of the benevo-<br/>lence and good disposition of our nation, where
                            the<br/> charity of all ranks, who have any thing to spare,<br/>ramifies
                            in all directions. Besides the relief afforded<br/>at home, nearly half
                            a million of money has been sent<br/>to <emph rend="italic"><a href="/places/spain">Spain<placename key="spain"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/portu">Portugal<placename key="portu"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/germ">Germany<placename key="germ"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/rus">Russia<placename key="rus"></placename></a></emph>, during and<br/>since the war, for the
                            relief of the sufferers. In the<br/>course of the last and the present
                            year, nearly a mil-<br/>lion more has been raised from individuals for
                            the re-<br/>lief of the wives, and families, and relations, of
                            the<br/>soldiers who fell at the great battle of Waterloo; be-<br/>sides
                            a reward to those who survived this great strug-<br/>gle, which
                            terminated a war of unexampled length,<br/>and which desolated the
                            greatest part of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.<br/>But this
                            benevolence is not confined to one object.<br/>It has ramified in all
                            directions. The sums subscri-<br/>bed to the Bible Society, has been
                            immense; and no<br/>doubt is entertained of its being supported in
                            prefer-<br/>ence to charities of every kind.</p>
<p>I trust that you and I shall never, in our days, see<br/>the sword of war
                            unsheathed. There appears now<br/>a strong disposition on the part of
                            the sovereigns and<br/>rulers of all the great powers in Europe, to
                            cultivate<br/>the arts of peace. The still perturbed and
                            unhappy<br/>state of <a href="/places/franc">France<placename key="franc"></placename></a> is now
                            the only circumstance that is<br/>likely to disturb our
                            tranquillity.</p>
<p>Our legislature, now freed from the distresses of<br/>war, is sedulously
                            devoting itself to the state of our<br/>police and internal policy.
                                <emph rend="italic">Mendicity, mad houses,<br/>saving banks, the
                                pauper system</emph>, &amp;c. &amp;c., at present<br/>engage their
                            attention: and the leading object is to<br/>promote humanity, and to
                            improve the state of soci-<br/>ety by education, provident habits, and
                            good laws, for<br/>the prevention of moral and criminal offences.</p>
<p>A penitentiary house, on a very large scale, is part-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_252" n="256"></pb>ly
                            finished, in fields within the liberty of <a href="/places/westm1">Westmin-ster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, at the public expense, with all the
                            improvements<br/>which experience has suggested, and a bill is
                            now<br/>in the house, for regulating insane establishments,<br/>and
                            appointing periodical visitants for the purpose of<br/>promoting
                            humanity and preventing abuses. But,<br/>after all, much remains to be
                            done. A continuance<br/>of peace may do much. The legislature, however,
                            is<br/>perhaps very properly slow in adopting new mea-<br/>sures and in
                            abolishing old customs. These feelings<br/>do not operate with the same
                            force in a new country.</p>
<p>I am surprised to find that my last work on the<br/><emph rend="italic">Population, Power, and Revenue of the British Empire</emph>,<br/>
                            had not been on sale in America; as the first edition<br/>went off in
                            eight months, although a very expensive<br/>book on account of the
                            number of tables. I have no<br/>doubt of its being reprinted in America.
                            Already there<br/>are two translations of the work in German, and
                            I<br/>believe also in French. I believe <a href="/people/hclay1">Mr.
                                Clay<persname key="hclay1"></persname></a>, when here,<br/>carried out a copy of it. He told me
                            he intended to<br/>do so. I send you under cover an epitome of
                            this<br/>work. It has been purchased by the ministers of all<br/>the
                            nations of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, as well as many
                            other foreign-<br/>ers. Through the medium of this work, much
                            has<br/>been disclosed on subjects tending to promote the<br/>happiness
                            of nations, and to prevent many of those<br/>errors by which their
                            decline has been effected.</p>
<p>It is a pleasing circumstance, to find your country<br/>is following our
                            example, with respect to free schools.<br/>We, at last, discover here,
                            that the general education<br/>of youth is not only the best prop to the
                            state, but to<br/>the happiness and prosperity of the people. I
                            trust<br/>your schools are established on a stable basis, which<br/>can
                            undergo no unfavourable change by the death or<br/>removal of the first
                            benevolent founders. For want<br/>of this, many excellent institutions
                            have fallen into<br/> decay, when their original founders were no
                            more.<br/>As yet, our legislature has afforded no pecuniary aid<br/>to
                            the numerous schools established in this country;<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_253" n="257"></pb>they
                            are entirely supported by the benevolence of the<br/>public. I trust,
                            ere long, their permanence will be<br/>secured by a national
                            institution, embracing the whole<br/>population.</p>
<p>I feel much gratified by the opportunity you afford-<br/>ed me, of making
                            the acquaintance of <a href="/people/jfran1">Dr. Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>.<br/>A
                            mind more ardent in the pursuit of useful know<br/>ledge, perhaps, never
                            existed; and, I have no doubt<br/>he will, in a few years, stand at the
                            head of his pro-<br/>fession. I introduced him to my son-in-law,
                                <a href="/people/gyeat1">Dr. Yeats<persname key="gyeat1"></persname></a>,<br/>who is an able and
                            learned physician,; he entertains<br/>a high opinion of your friend's
                            talents, and, I am<br/>sure, will, at all times, be happy in the
                            opportunity of<br/>being useful to him.</p>
<p>My health declines, as may naturally be expected,<br/>as old age
                            approaches; but, upon the whole, I have<br/>no reason to complain.
                            Regularity and temperance<br/>are my chief and best medicine for all
                            complaints.</p>
<p>I shall always be happy to hear from you, and to<br/>make such
                            communications as I conceive may be<br/>useful to mankind in general;
                            but let me entreat of<br/>you, my good friend, <emph rend="italic">not
                                to make my letters public</emph>.<br/>Engaged, as I constantly am,
                            in a great variety of<br/> pursuits, I can only snatch a moment
                            occasionally for<br/>private correspondence, which can never be
                            sufficiently<br/>correct for the public eye.</p>
<p>I send by <a href="/people/jfran1">Dr. Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>, a parcel,
                            containing such<br/>publications as are likely to prove interesting to

<salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>The letters, dated on the <date when="1816-07-18">18th July last</date>,
                            and<br/>which, as Secretary of the Board of
                            Commissioners,<br/>constituted by the act, entitled, <q>an act to
                                provide for<br/>the improvement of the internal navigation of
                                this<br/> state,</q> you addressed to us, respectively, came to
                            hand,<br/>with their enclosures, in due season.</p>
<p>We have forborne advertising our appointment, or<br/>taking any step to
                            procure and receive subscriptions<br/>in lands, or money, to be applied
                            to the construction<br/>of the contemplated canals, from a conviction
                            that<br/>an appeal to our fellow citizens for voluntary aid,<br/>under
                            existing circumstances, would be premature.<br/>Until the Legislature
                            has passed an act, whereby the<br/>public faith is pledged for beginning
                            and complet-<br/>ing the canal, we apprehend no discreet citizen
                            will<br/>be disposed to deprive himself of the use of his land,<br/>or
                            money, for a considerable period of time. The<br/>sole object of the act
                            appointing the Commissioners,<br/>is to obtain, from their report, a
                            mass of useful in-<br/>formation, for the purpose of guiding the
                            judgment<br/>of the Legislature, in deciding on the expediency of<br/>
                            undertaking, or rejecting, the proposed enterprise.<br/>Although we are
                            well persuaded that the trusts re- <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_255" n="259"></pb>posed in the
                            Commissioners will appear to have been<br/>executed with great ability,
                            and the utmost fidelity,<br/>yet, their report, from the novelty and
                            magnitude of<br/>its subject, may induce the Legislature to seek
                            fur-<br/>ther information, before it finally decides on the<br/>course
                            to be pursued. Thus, a final decision may<br/>be delayed longer than the
                            ensuing session of the<br/> Legislature; and, when every proper source
                            of inform-<br/>ation has been exhausted, that decision may
                            be<br/>against the enterprise. There is nothing in the pre-<br/>sent act
                            to preclude such decision; and hence we<br/>are of opinion, that the act
                            furnishes no adequate<br/>motives for private subscriptions, either in
                            lands or<br/>money.</p>
<p>We submit these sentiments to the Commissioners,<br/>with all deference,
                            and we remain, with respect,</p>

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIENDS,</salute></opener>
<p>Your favour of <date when="1816-11-28">28th ult.</date> was last evening
                            laid<br/>before our <a href="/organizations/nymindian">Committee on Indian
                                Affairs<orgname key="nymindian"></orgname></a>, and we<br/>were directed to communicate to you
                            such remarks<br/>as we might judge suitable, relating to the
                            subject<br/>alluded to in your letter.</p>
<p>Many of our <a href="/organizations/nymindian">Committee<orgname key="nymindian"></orgname></a> have been, for
                            some time,<br/> attentive to the situation of the <a href="/organizations/seneca">Seneca<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> nation, and<br/>have had great fears lest they
                            might be sadly im-<br/>posed on, by the person who has purchased the
                            pre-<br/>emption right of the <a href="/organizations/hollco">Holland
                                Company<orgname key="hollco"></orgname></a>. It may be<br/>useful to state, that all the land
                            on the west side of<br/>the <geogname key="genes2">River
                                Genesee</geogname>, belonged originally to the state
                                of<br/><a href="/places/mass">Massachusetts<placename key="mass"></placename></a>—that is, the
                            right of soil, or the exclu-<br/>sive right of purchasing the same of
                            the Indians; the<br/>right of jurisdiction has always been considered
                            to<br/>be in the state of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>.
                            The state of <a href="/places/mass">Massachu-setts<placename key="mass"></placename></a> sold
                            their pre-emption right to the whole coun-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_256" n="260"></pb>try, to
                            Gorham &amp; Phelps, and they sold to <a href="/people/rmorr1">RobertMorris<persname key="rmorr1"></persname></a>, and he to the <a href="/people/hollco">Holland Company<persname key="hollco"></persname></a>; the latter<br/>(several years ago)
                            purchased all the said land of the<br/>Indians, except certain tracts
                            which they reserved,<br/>one situated at the <a href="/places/catta1">Cattaraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a>, one at <a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, one<br/>on <geogname key="alleg">Allegany</geogname>, and one on <geogname key="genes2">Genesee</geogname>; possibly there<br/>may be more. The <a href="/organizations/hollco">Holland Company<orgname key="hollco"></orgname></a> sold their pre-<br/>emption
                            right, for the whole of these reservations,<br/>(we are told at 50 cents
                            per acre,) to a person who is<br/>now a member of Congress, and resides
                            at <a href="/places/hamil2">Hamilton<placename key="hamil2"></placename></a>,<br/>on the <geogname key="stlar">St. Lawrence</geogname>. About three years ago, he<br/>
                            employed <a href="/people/jrich1">Joseph Richardson<persname key="jrich1"></persname></a> (formerly
                            of <a href="/places/perki">Perkcom-ing<placename key="perki"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/philc">Philadelphia county<placename key="philc"></placename></a>,) to hold a treaty at
                                <a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>,<br/>for the purpose of
                            trying to persuade the Indians to<br/>exchange their reservations for
                            lands (which he <emph rend="italic">said</emph><br/>he owned) on
                                <geogname key="whiter">White River</geogname>, in <a href="/places/illinois">Illinois<placename key="illinois"></placename></a> Territory; you<br/>know the
                            result of that treaty, and are, likely, ac-<br/>quainted with the
                            remarkable speech of <a href="/people/redja1">Red
                            Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>.<br/>This treaty was unlawful, as the laws of the
                            United<br/>States prohibit any treaty being held with the In-<br/>dians,
                            for the purpose of purchasing their lands,<br/><emph rend="italic">unless a Commissioner appointed by the President should<br/>be
                                present</emph>. All the reservations are said to be lands<br/>of the
                            very first quality, and particularly the one at<br/><a href="/places/buffa">Buffaloe<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, which is very valuable; a part of
                            it, adjoining<br/>the village, is said to be worth from 100 to 200
                            dollars<br/> per acre, if the Indian title was extinguished. It<br/>has
                            been said, that on an average, that reservation<br/>would sell for more
                            than thirty dollars per acre—<br/>possibly this may be estimating it too
                            high. The<br/>present holder of the pre-emption right is esteemed<br/>a
                            respectable man, and, perhaps, would be more<br/>scrupulous in the means
                            he might use, in effecting<br/>his purchase of the Indians, than some
                            others might;<br/>yet, as the temptation is powerful, and as in
                            the<br/>general practice of men, (who are commonly <emph rend="italic">called</emph><br/>honest,) it is really considered not to be
                            criminal to<br/>impose on <emph rend="italic">Indians</emph>, advantage
                            has been taken of<br/>their ignorance and credulity;—a man's
                            character<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_257" n="261"></pb>seems not to be lessened in the esteem of
                            his acquaint-<br/>ance, if he should endeavour to get the chiefs in
                            a<br/>state of intoxication, in order to gain their influence<br/>over
                            the nation, with a view that he may make a<br/>profitable bargain. It
                            is, we believe, true, that the<br/>consent, or act of the chiefs, binds
                            the whole nation,<br/>in sales of their lands; but, generally, the whole
                            are<br/>consulted, yet often (mostly) the chiefs are bribed
                            to<br/>consent, in order to influence the others. Although<br/>no treaty
                            can be held for purchasing without a Com-<br/>missioner, appointed by
                            the President, be present, to<br/>prevent the Indians being imposed on,
                            yet it would<br/>probably not be difficult for him to get such a
                            man<br/>appointed as would answer his purposes. Many per-<br/>sons,
                            (high in office in this state,) who profess, and,<br/>indeed, seem to be
                            well disposed and friendly to the<br/>Indians, have openly and decidedly
                            given their opi-<br/>nions, that it would be better for them to sell
                            their<br/> reservations, and remove to some remote situation to<br/>the
                            Westward; they say that now they are exposed<br/>to a constant
                            intercourse with bad whites, who sup-<br/>ply them with rum, and in
                            every way try to cheat<br/>them, and corrupt their principles, and, if
                            they re-<br/>main, the consequence will be, that they will be
                            soon<br/>extinct. They add, that the Christian party, at<br/>
<a href="/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>, owing to their having more
                            intercourse with<br/>the whites, are more depraved than the Pagan
                            party.<br/>It is, perhaps, not in our power to say, whether
                            such<br/>removal would, eventually, be better for the Indians<br/>or
                            not; but it appears to us, that if they should go<br/>far West, they
                            will still be exposed to the same evil,<br/>and would suffer still
                            worse, from a kind of white<br/>people, who are not so much under the
                            restraints of<br/>law as the same description of whites who
                            now<br/>surround them. At present, the influence of many<br/>respectable
                            persons, who reside near them, serves<br/>much to protect them from
                            frequent injury and im-<br/>position, and the assistance they would,
                            from time to<br/>time, receive from Friends, might, at least,
                            preserve<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_258" n="262"></pb>them from going backwards, and possibly
                            tend to<br/>advance them in agriculture, &amp;c. Taking a view
                            of<br/>the whole subject, in all its various ramifications,
                            we<br/>cannot but believe it would be most for the advan-<br/>tage of
                            the Indians, to remain on their respective<br/> reservations.</p>
<p>It may be useful to examine, 1st. Suppose the In-<br/>dians should
                            conclude to sell their present posses-<br/>sions, is it expedient for
                            Friends to offer them assist-<br/>ance and advice? 2nd. If it is deemed
                            proper for<br/>Friends to interfere, then what course would be most<br/>
                            advisable? 3rd. What advice should be given to<br/>them, in case the
                            Indians should ask for it?</p>
<p>In reply to the first proposition, we are of opinion,<br/>that if they
                            should conclude to sell, it would not be ex-<br/>pedient to offer
                            assistance, or advice, unsolicited, as<br/>it would irritate the person
                            who holds the pre-emp-<br/>tion right, and the conduct of Friends might
                            be<br/>wrongly represented to both Indians and whites, and<br/>in many
                            ways it might prove injurious to the cause<br/>in which we are
                            engaged.</p>
<p> In reply to the second proposition, we think Friends<br/>cannot be
                            indifferent spectators, if the Indians should<br/>agree to dispose of
                            their lands, as our minds are im-<br/>pressed with a belief, that great
                            unfairness would<br/>most probably be shown towards them. It
                            might<br/>be right to interfere, so far as that a
                            sub-committee,<br/>from your general committee, might wait on
                            the<br/>President, and confidentially communicate to him<br/>the
                            propriety of his being on his guard in selecting<br/>a person as
                            Commissioner, urging to him the neces-<br/>sity of appointing a person
                            of established good repu-<br/>tation, of undoubted integrity, and purity
                            of charac-<br/>ter. If the Indians are induced to make
                            application,<br/>and <emph rend="italic">solicit</emph> the advice of
                            Friends, it appears to us<br/>Friends might (and perhaps ought to)
                            afford every<br/>assistance and advice they might require; but,
                            even<br/>then, it would be necessary to exercise great pru-<br/>dence
                            and circumspection in every movement.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_259" n="263"></pb>
<p>In reply to the third proposition—If the Indians <emph rend="italic">ask</emph><br/>for advice, after they may have determined on a
                            sale,<br/>the advice proper to be given them must depend<br/>upon
                            circumstances that may then be unfolded. If<br/>they ask for advice,
                            whether they had best remove<br/>to the westward, or, if it would be
                            best for them to<br/>remain on their reservations, the sentiments
                            of<br/>Friends might then be communicated to them, and,<br/>if they
                            should be fixed in their intention to make<br/>sale, perhaps it might be
                            well to propose to them to<br/>sell one of their reservations, or, if
                            each reservation<br/>belongs to a particular tribe, then each tribe to
                            sell a<br/>portion of their respective reservation; for the
                            remain-<br/>der, (not sold,) they might, perhaps, be persuaded
                            to<br/>employ a surveyor, and have it divided into lots of<br/>100 acres
                            each—a lot to be the separate property of<br/>each Indian family—to go
                            by descent to nearest kin,<br/>in the same manner as estates with
                            us.</p>
<p>We have thus far, in freedom, endeavoured to ex-<br/>hibit to your view,
                            our sentiments, as they have<br/>occurred; and have been more
                            particular, as the lands<br/>are in this state, and, therefore, thought,
                            perhaps,<br/>you might not be acquainted with all the
                            circum-<br/>stances connected with the subject; but as you have<br/>
                            been longer conversant with Indian affairs than our-<br/>selves, we
                            leave the subject to your farther investiga-<br/>tion, and, if at any
                            time we can be useful, we will<br/>very readily attend to any farther
                            communications<br/>you may think proper to make to us.</p>
<p>As to the situation of the <a href="/organizations/brotherton">Brothertown
                                Indians<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a>,<br/>we may inform you, that many years ago,
                            (perhaps<br/>thirty,) the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>,
                            taking into consideration the<br/>situation of the remains of several
                            tribes of Indians<br/>on the east end of <a href="/places/longi">Long
                                Island<placename key="longi"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/narra">Narraganset<placename key="narra"></placename></a>,
                            and<br/>other parts near the sea shore, concluded to make<br/>them a
                            present of a piece of land, (now called <a href="/places/broth">Bro-thertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>,) six miles square, without the power
                            of<br/>alienation. Some families of those Indians moved<br/>on to this
                            tract, and the white people soon got in<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_260" n="264"></pb>among them,
                            persuaded the Indians, when in a state<br/>of intoxication, to sell them
                            their improvement, with<br/>several lots of 100 and 200 acres. About the year<br/>
<date when="1794">1794</date>, a deputation of <a href="/organizations/brotherton">Indians<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a>, from <a href="/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>,<br/>came to some Friends of this city, and
                            stated their<br/>situation to be very deplorable, owing to the
                            imposi-<br/>tion and very bad conduct of the white people, whom<br/>they
                            had admitted into their settlement. Two<br/>Friends went with these
                            deputies to the Governor,<br/>and the situation of the Indians were
                            represented to<br/>him. Agreeably to the orders of the Governor,
                            the<br/>sheriff took a number of civil officers, and turned off<br/>the
                            intruders. In two years after this, the Indians<br/>came again to
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, and represented that
                            the<br/>white people had returned with additional numbers.<br/>and that
                            their situation was now much more deplo-<br/>rable. The subject was
                            referred to the Legislature,<br/>then in session. An act passed,
                            appointing three<br/> Commissioners to proceed to <a href="/places/broth">Brothertown<placename key="broth"></placename></a>, and adjust<br/>the business, with the
                            concurrence of the Indians, in<br/>any way they might be of opinion
                            would be most to<br/>their advantage. It was agreed by the
                            Commis-<br/>sioners, with the consent of the Indians, to set off
                            in<br/>one corner of the tract, about 6000 acres, and settle<br/>the
                            same in lots of 50 to 100 acres to each of the in-<br/>truders, who were
                            to pay the state for the same five<br/>or six dollars per acre, the
                            state to pay the interest<br/>(seven per cent.) on the proceeds of the
                            sale (amount-<br/>ing to 2169 dollars a year) to three persons, to
                            be<br/>appointed superintendents of the affairs of the <a href="/organizations/brotherton">Bro-thertown Indians<orgname key="brotherton"></orgname></a>, to be laid out
                            by them, for sup-<br/>porting a school, and other purposes, for the
                            benefit<br/> of the Indians. The remainder of the land was divi-<br/>ded
                            into 100 and 50 acre lots, and allotted, 100 to a<br/>family, and 50 to
                            a young man. By an act confirm-<br/>ing the acts of the Commissioners,
                            five Indians were<br/>to be annually appointed, called peace makers,
                            who<br/>were to act the same as justices of the peace, to hold<br/>a
                            court monthly, to settle differences, and issue exe-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_261" n="265"></pb>cution to an Indian constable, for debts under ten<br/>dollars,
                            &amp;c. This act you may find in the revised<br/>laws of <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, passed <date when="1813">1813</date>. (See 2d vol. page 160.)<br/>You may, likely, meet with
                            it at the Mayor's office,<br/>or with some lawyer in your city.</p>

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p> I return thee my most sincere and warmest thanks<br/>for thy kind letter
                            and valuable pamphlets, sent me<br/>by <a href="/people/jfran1">Dr.
                                Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>, and should, before this time, have<br/>made my
                            acknowledgments for these favours, had I<br/>met with a suitable
                            opportunity of a person by whom<br/>I could have sent some tracts.</p>
<p>I have the pleasure to state, that at <a href="/places/hartf">Hartford<placename key="hartf"></placename></a>, in<br/><a href="/places/connt">Connecticut<placename key="connt"></placename></a>, they have formed a valuable and
                            exten-<br/>sive establishment for instructing the deaf and
                            dumb,<br/>which has been aided by their legislature, and
                            con-<br/>siderable subscriptions of private individuals of
                            that<br/>State, and citizens of this and other adjoining<br/> States.
                            The Institution is to be under the superin-<br/>tendance and management
                            of my friend, <a href="/people/tgall1">Gallaudet<persname key="tgall1"></persname></a>,<br/>who will
                            have, as an assistant, a Frenchman who is<br/>deaf and dumb, and who was
                            a professor, several<br/>years, in the institution at Paris. Nothing of
                            the<br/>kind exists in any other part of the United States;<br/>and, in
                            my opinion, the <a href="/places/hartf">Hartford<placename key="hartf"></placename></a>
                            establishment will<br/>be sufficient to serve all the states north of
                                <a href="/places/penns">Pennsyl-vania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>Among the many philanthropic institutions with<br/>which your country
                            abounds, there is none that ap-<br/>pears to me more likely to be useful
                            than saving<br/>banks. They are certainly most admirably calculated<br/>
                            to be beneficial to the poor, by promoting amongst<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_262" n="266"></pb>them
                            a spirit of independence, economy, and industry.<br/>Immediately on
                            receiving from thee an account of<br/>the provident institution in your
                            metropolis, I pro-<br/>posed to a number of my friends to establish a
                            simi-<br/>lar one in this city. A plan was formed, and a<br/>number of
                            our most respectable citizens agreed to<br/>undertake the management of
                            it; but we found that<br/>we could not go into operation without an act
                            of<br/> incorporation, for which we made an application to<br/>the
                            legislature, and the result is not yet known.</p>
<p>An act is now before our legislature, for comple-<br/>ting a <geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname> from <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogname> to the <geogname key="huds">Hudson</geogname>.
                            Our<br/>mutual friend, <a href="/people/jgrei1">John Grieg<persname key="jgrei1"></persname></a>,
                            Esq., has with him a map<br/>and profile of the track of the <geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname>, the inspection<br/>of which will be
                            interesting to thee.</p>
<p>We have now, in this city, twenty-seven <emph rend="italic">Sunday</emph><br/> schools, at which 5000 scholars are instructed.
                            I<br/>lately visited two of them, kept for black people,<br/>adults; at
                            one of them, I noticed two black women,<br/>one of them seventy, and the
                            other ninety years old.<br/>They both seemed to please themselves very
                            much<br/>with the prospect of being soon able to read the<br/>Bible.</p>
<p>Our legislature passed a law about two weeks ago,<br/>declaring that
                            every person now held in slavery, shall<br/>be free after <date when="1827-07-04">4th July, 1827</date>. In the eastern
                            States,<br/>and in the State of <a href="/places/ohio">Ohio<placename key="ohio"></placename></a>,
                            slavery is prohibited.</p>
<p>Free schools and Sunday schools are spread, and<br/> are increasing
                            throughout our State, and our govern-<br/>ment have made very liberal
                            provision for their sup-<br/>port ; and Bible Societies receive great
                            patronage, and<br/>are established in almost every part of the
                            United<br/> States.</p>
<p>I have lately lost thy excellent and very valuable<br/>work on Indigence,
                            published in <date when="1806">1806</date>, and shall es-<br/>teem it as
                            a particular favour, if thou wilt be pleased<br/>to send me another
                            copy.</p>
<p>The asylum for lunatics, mentioned in my letter<br/>of <date when="1816-05-04">4th May</date>, is intended to be commenced
                            building<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_263" n="267"></pb>this season. The plan being adopted
                            through my<br/>recommendation, I feel myself under an obligation<br/>to
                            pay attention to it, and this occupies, at present,<br/>a great portion
                            of my time. We propose to have<br/>separate buildings for men and women
                            patients,<br/>about 300 feet distant from each other, besides
                            one<br/>other building, remote from these, for violent <emph rend="italic">noisy<br/>patients</emph>; this will be a great
                            improvement on the <emph rend="italic">old</emph><br/>system, of having
                            them <emph rend="italic">all</emph> under one roof.</p>
<p>There is no one evil prevalent in this country, we<br/>have so much
                            reason to lament and deplore, as the<br/>intemperate use of ardent
                            spirits. It is distilled<br/>mostly from grain, in every part of the
                            United States,<br/>and sold at about seventy-five cents per gallon.
                            The<br/>quantity of brandy, gin, and rum imported from<br/>Europe and
                            the West Indies, and whiskey, &amp;c., made<br/>in this country, is
                            equal to twenty-four millions of<br/>gallons, so that, supposing the
                            population of the Uni-<br/>ted States to be eight millions, this gives
                            to each man,<br/>woman, and child, three gallons a-year! In the
                            late<br/> war, it is supposed six thousand persons lost their<br/>lives,
                            owing to that dreadful calamity, and that a<br/>greater number of
                            persons were destroyed during<br/>that period by the use of spirituous
                            liquors. This<br/>vice enervates the mind to such a degree, that of
                            the<br/>individuals whose habits are fixed in the use of
                            it,<br/>scarcely one in one thousand leave it off; attention<br/>to
                            wives, children, friends, their own interest, health,<br/> character,
                            rank in life, and reputation, are all sacri-<br/>ficed to gratify their
                            inclination for this most dreadful<br/>poison. There appears no remedy
                            sufficient to cure<br/>this disease of the mind, but the operation of
                            the<br/> power of religion.</p>

<p>The Commissioners to connect the navigable<br/>waters of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname> and the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogname>, have not<br/>yet appointed an engineer,
                            and it is difficult to select<br/>a person for so important and
                            responsible a situa-<br/>tion. The appointment will be a very
                            honourable<br/>one, and it is very desirable it should be
                            conferred<br/>on a man fully competent, and deserving entire
                            con-<br/>fidence; to direct the manner in which the various<br/> parts
                            of the work should be executed—to make con-<br/>tracts with the workmen,
                            &amp;c. &amp;c. requires a combina-<br/>tion of talents, industry, and
                            intelligence, that is rare-<br/>ly to be found in an individual. I have
                            been long<br/>acquainted with the general character of <a href="/people/tmoor1">ThomasMoore<persname key="tmoor1"></persname></a>, of <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>, and it occurred to me, that he<br/>would
                            answer the views of the Commissioners, but<br/>having no personal
                            acquaintance with him, and not<br/>being possessed of a knowledge of his
                            abilities, suf-<br/>ficient to justify one to recommend him to the
                            Com-<br/>missioners, I am induced, by the recommendation of<br/>my

<p>Not having the pleasure of an acquaintance, I must<br/>confide in thy

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I arrived here the day before yesterday, and I<br/>have this day received
                            the appointment of surveyor<br/>for the contemplated grand <geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname>. My friend, <a href="/people/teddy1">ThomasEddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, of this city, has generally been in the
                            first<br/>rank amongst his fellow citizens, as an active and<br/>
                            efficient promoter of useful and benevolent works,<br/>has long been one
                            of the Commissioners for this par-<br/>ticular object, and though he is
                            not now one, still<br/>retains all his wishes for its success, and the
                            ener-<br/>gies of his mind are still in full activity for its
                            accom-<br/>plishment. He has mentioned, in conversation with<br/>me, his
                            views, that the task of the ascertainment of<br/>lines, and the
                            superintendence of the work of making<br/>the <geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname>, would be too burdensome for <emph rend="italic">one man</emph>—<br/>that the magnitude of the object, would not
                            only<br/>render expedient, but necessary, the employment of<br/>two
                            Superintendents, an Engineer, and a Mathema-<br/>tician, each in his
                            appropriate department. I per-<br/>fectly accord with him in these
                            views. I mentioned<br/>to him <a href="/people/tmoor1">Thomas
                                Moore<persname key="tmoor1"></persname></a>, a man whom I know to be<br/>eminently qualified
                            for the undertaking—of a sound<br/>and discriminating mind—a judicious
                            and practical<br/>engineer, and one with whom I shall be glad to
                            act.<br/>I remarked, that thou wast well acquainted with
                            his<br/>qualifications and talents, and suggested the proprie-<br/>ty of
                            his addressing thee on the subject, and request-<br/>ing thy opinion. He
                            alleged he had no acquaintance<br/> with thee, but if I would write, he
                            would enclose<br/>my letter in a few lines from himself.</p>
<p>I know not whether <a href="/people/tmoor1">Thomas Moore<persname key="tmoor1"></persname></a> would
                            accept<br/>such an appointment, but I am induced to believe
                            the<br/>Commissioners would be liberal in their offer; and I<br/>also
                            believe his correctness and economy to be such<br/>in the application of
                            public money, that more would<br/>be saved by giving <emph rend="italic">him</emph> a salary of 10,000 dollars a<br/>year, than employing
                            one less qualified for nothing.</p>

<p>I return thee my most sincere thanks for thy very<br/>polite and friendly
                            letter, by <a href="/people/cbrow1">Captain Brown<persname key="cbrow1"></persname></a>,

                            prevented from sooner ac-<br/>knowledging the favour, by absence from
                            the city<br/>for some months past. I now send some books, which,<br/>I
                            trust, will be interesting, and of which I request<br/>thy acceptance.
                            Amongst them thou wilt find the<br/>last Annual Report of our <a href="/organizations/ambib">American Bible Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>,<br/>which be pleased
                            to present to your Bible Society.<br/>If that Society would address the
                                <a href="/organizations/ambib">American BibleSociety<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>,
                            announcing their formation, and forward a<br/>copy of their
                            constitution, with a sketch of the pros-<br/>pect before them, it would
                            be the means of opening<br/>a correspondence between the two Societies,
                            that<br/>might prove mutually useful.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/ambib">American Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a> have printed a number
                            of<br/>French stereotype bibles, containing the Old and
                            New<br/>Testaments, and would cheerfully supply yours, at<br/>the cost
                            of printing and binding.</p>
<p>A highly respectable society has been formed at<br/><a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, for the purpose of colonizing the free<br/>
                            people of colour in the United States. I send thee a<br/>pamphlet,
                            stating the views of this society; but they<br/>have not yet concluded
                            to what part of the world it<br/>would be most advisable to recommend
                            their emigra-<br/>tion. This society is about sending an agent
                                to<br/><a href="/places/afri">Africa<placename key="afri"></placename></a>, to endeavour to
                            procure an asylum for them<br/>at Sherbro, near <a href="/places/sierr">Sierra Leone<placename key="sierr"></placename></a>, or some other part of<br/>the continent.
                            I am of opinion it would not answer<br/>for them to go to your island,
                            unless a permanent<br/>peace was established. When that happy event
                            shall<br/>have taken place, it will certainly be more for their <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_267" n="271"></pb>interest to remove there, than any other part of
                            the<br/>world. Many of them are sober and industrious, are<br/>well
                            acquainted with agriculture, and are good me-<br/>chanics.</p>
<p>A young man left here a few months ago for <a href="/places/paupr">Portau Prince<placename key="paupr"></placename></a>, who was sent from <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> by the British<br/>and Foreign School
                            Society, for the purpose of intro-<br/>ducing schools in your island, on
                            an extensive and<br/>improved plan. I am anxious to know if he is
                            likely<br/>to succeed, and should be much gratified in learning<br/>that
                            you have a number of schools, established in<br/>different parts of thy
                            government. To thy enlight-<br/>ened mind it is unnecessary for me to
                            enlarge on the<br/>importance of this object, to advance which your<br/>
                            government cannot appropriate too much money.</p>
<p>I have also sent thee a volume of the Transactions<br/>of the New York
                            Literary and Philosophical Society.<br/>If you have any pamphlets or
                            other objects, relating<br/>to the natural history of your island, they
                            would be<br/>very acceptable.</p>
<p>It would afford me singular pleasure to render thee<br/>any services; and
                            if, in any way, it is in my power<br/>to be useful to thee in this city,
                            I beg thou wilt freely<br/>command me. I am, with sentiments of the

<salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your obliging<br/>favour of the
                                <date when="1817-04-09">9th of April</date> last, with the
                            accompany-<br/>ing books and pamphlets, which were safely
                            deli-<br/>vered by Mr. <a href="/people/jgrei1">Greig<persname key="jgrei1"></persname></a>, and for
                            which I beg you will<br/>accept of my best thanks. I should have done
                            this<br/> at an earlier period, had I not waited for <a href="/people/jgrei1">Mr. Greig<persname key="jgrei1"></persname></a>'s<br/>return, which has been
                            protracted far beyond the<br/>time either he or I had calculated upon.
                            He has been<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_268" n="272"></pb>so obliging as to take charge of a parcel
                            for you, in<br/>which, according to your desire, you will find a
                            copy<br/>of my Treatise on Indigence, and the three last re-<br/>ports
                            of our Society for bettering the Condition of the<br/>Poor, with several
                            other tracts, which I trust you will<br/>find interesting.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to observe the rapid progress you<br/>make in originating,
                            and carrying into effect, useful<br/> institutions for improving the
                            state of society in your<br/>country, in all which you appear to act a
                            prominent<br/>part; and well may it be said, <emph rend="italic">that
                                you deserve well of<br/>your country</emph>, since your whole time
                            and attention are<br/>bestowed in promoting measures tending to the
                                <emph rend="italic">pre-<br/>vention of criminal offences, to the
                                religious and moral<br/>instruction of infants and adults, to the
                                relief of mental<br/>and bodily infirmity</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">to the general improvement of<br/>the morals of the
                                people</emph>.</p>
<p>You will observe, that so far back as the year<br/><date when="1806">1806</date>, I recommended Provident Banks, in my Trea-<br/>tise on
                            Indigence, upon a national plan. The idea<br/>of such institutions
                            originated with me ; but the pub-<br/>lic mind was not then prepared for
                            such institutions,<br/>and I much fear they will not be rendered
                            perma-<br/>nent under the present system, on account of the la-<br/>bour
                            attending the gratuitous management, although<br/>our legislature has
                            afforded them some facilities, with<br/>respect to the deposits. Had my
                            plan been adopted<br/>in <date when="1806">1806</date>, I am certain
                            that not less than seven mil-<br/>lions sterling of the property of the
                            labouring classes<br/>would have now been yielding interest. The
                            insti-<br/>tutions, however, as now constituted, have
                            become<br/>popular, and they are spreading fast all over
                            the<br/>country; but the demand for labour, in consequence<br/>of the
                            happy return of peace, is unfortunately much<br/>less than the supply,
                            and the poor, out of work, or<br/>being only half employed, and wages
                            being generally<br/>reduced, they have little to spare; but, upon the
                            whole,<br/>more money is deposited than could reasonably have<br/> been
                            expected. In <date when="1816">1816</date>, and part of last year,
                            there<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_269" n="273"></pb>was much distress in the country, in
                            consequence of<br/>the general stagnation of trade and
                            manufactures,<br/>and the low price of agricultural produce; but
                            of<br/>late a favourable change has taken place: the ma-<br/>nufacturers
                            are generally well employed, and the<br/> agricultural produce makes a
                            fair return to the<br/>farmers.</p>
<p>This country has made great efforts, as well as<br/>very considerable
                            pecuniary sacrifices, to induce the<br/>nations of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a> to abandon the odious slave trade,<br/>and they
                            are likely to be successful at last; and,<br/>after the lapse of two
                            years, I trust, it will no longer<br/>exist. We continue to go on here
                            in promoting phi-<br/>lanthropic institutions; but it requires much
                            good<br/>judgment, and a perfect knowledge of the world, to<br/>select
                            those which, in their practical effect, shall pro-<br/>duce that good to
                            the community, which will com-<br/>pensate the expense and gratuitous
                            labour which is<br/>required. Theories are often fallacious, although
                            of<br/>much promise, and it is only in their practical effect<br/>that
                            their real utility is discovered.</p>
<p>Our London hospitals have undergone much im-<br/>provement of late,
                            especially since they have attracted<br/>the notice of the legislature;
                            and, I trust, they will<br/>be farther ameliorated.</p>
<p>We find here the same corruption of morals, arising<br/>from the
                            immoderate use of ardent spirits in vulgar<br/>life, which you
                            experience at <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. It is a<br/>
                            malady in the moral world which is difficult to cure,<br/>and our only
                            hope is, that the rising generation, from<br/>being better taught, in
                            consequence of the general<br/>dissemination of free schools, will
                            conduct themselves<br/> with more propriety. The quantity of gin drank
                            by<br/>the lower orders of society in this great and over-<br/>grown
                            metropolis, in which so many loose and dis-<br/>solute characters are
                            congregated, exceeds all calcu-<br/>lation, and there is no doubt of
                            many thousands<br/>being sent prematurely to the grave, by indulging
                            in<br/>this odious vice. I have for twenty-five years, as a <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_270" n="274"></pb>magistrate, exerted myself to the utmost to check
                            the<br/>progress of this crying evil, by suppressing liquor<br/>shops;
                            but, as those licensed to sell ale and beer, or<br/>porter, are also
                            entitled to retail spirits, the task<br/>became extremely difficult. In
                            this country it is a<br/>productive source of revenue. Referring you to
                            our<br/>mutual good friend for further particulars, I remain<br/>always,
                            with the most genuine regard,</p>

<salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of thy ac-<br/>ceptable favour of <date when="1818-03-05">3d mo. 5th</date>, which has been
                            com-<br/>municated to the Board of Trustees of our <a href="/organizations/nyfss">Free School Society<orgname key="nyfss"></orgname></a>. They were highly pleased with
                            the<br/>care and attention of the British and Foreign Society,<br/>in
                            procuring a person, by thy account, so suitably<br/>qualified to take
                            charge of the schools under their<br/>care, as <a href="/people/cpict1">Charles Picton<persname key="cpict1"></persname></a>. We hope he is now on his<br/>passage to
                            this country, and that he will soon be with<br/>us. Our annual report is
                            now printing, and I hope<br/>to get a copy in time to send thee by this
                            opportunity.<br/>We have just established a third school near this
                            city,<br/>of about two hundred scholars, and we are about<br/>erecting a
                            school house, (No. 4,) to accommodate six<br/>hundred, so that at the
                            close of this year the Society<br/> will have under their charge about
                            two thousand<br/>children. The system is spreading in a most
                            remark-<br/>able manner in every part of this state, and indeed<br/>very
                            generally through the United States. The slave<br/>states are much
                            behind all others in every thing that<br/>relates to religious or moral
                            improvements. The<br/>Sunday School Society in this city have
                            succeeded<br/>in a most wonderful manner. They have
                            thirty-six<br/>schools open every first day, and in the whole
                            about<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_271" n="275"></pb>three thousand five hundred children are
                            regularly<br/>instructed in school learning, and much pains taken<br/>in
                            their religious and moral instruction. The best<br/>school in this city
                            is the African Free School, under<br/>the care of our Abolition Society.
                            They have in this<br/>school from two hundred and fifty to three
                            hundred<br/>children ; besides this, some young women (Friends)<br/>have
                            a first day school for black women. I lately<br/>visited it, and noticed
                            one woman seventy-two years<br/>of age, and another
                            ninety-one!—Including these<br/> schools, and Sunday schools, there are
                            about six hun-<br/>dred people of colour who receive the benefits of
                            edu-<br/>cation in this city.</p>
<p>I should esteem it a particular favour if thou<br/>wouldst send me a
                            number of your last Annual Report<br/>of the British and Foreign School
                            Society, and also<br/> some of the former years. If you have published
                            a<br/>historical account of that society, it would also be<br/>very
                            acceptable.</p>
<p>Inclosed is a letter from <a href="/people/mknig1">Mary Knight<persname key="mknig1"></persname></a>,
                            handed me<br/>by a valuable friend, left open for thy perusal;
                            he<br/>requests thy kind attention to have it safely delivered<br/>as
                            directed.</p>
<p>During the last sitting of our Legislature, I sent to<br/>a member the
                            following resolution, and proposed to<br/>his consideration to offer it
                            to the House of Assembly:</p>
<p><said who="teddy1">Resolved, If the Hon. the Senate concur
                                therein,<br/>that the Governor be empowered, and he is
                                hereby<br/>empowered, to appoint three discreet and
                                competent<br/>persons, citizens of the state, as Commissioners,
                                for<br/>the purpose of considering what amendments, if any,<br/> are
                                necessary in the existing penal laws, and to de-<br/>vise the best
                                plan for the management of the State<br/>Prisons; and that the
                                Commissioners, so appointed,<br/>after due consideration of all
                                matters and things<br/>relative to the present penal code, report to
                                the next<br/>Legislature, such alterations and amendments of
                                the<br/>existing laws relative to crimes and their
                                punish-<br/>ments, as in their opinion may best conduce to
                            the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_272" n="276"></pb>welfare of the state, by the prevention of
                                crimes,<br/>with such reasons and observations as they may<br/>deem
                                requisite to explain and elucidate the al-<br/>terations or
                                improvements they may recommend;<br/>and to inquire into and examine
                                the first and<br/>present administration of the State Prison, and
                                to<br/>point out the defects, if any exist, in the manage-<br/>ment
                                and government thereof, and what alterations<br/>and improvements in
                                their opinion may be necessary;<br/>and also to devise and propose a
                                plan of prisons to<br/>be erected in different parts of the state,
                                for the con-<br/>finement of persons convicted of minor offences;
                                and<br/> generally to suggest all such other matters, as in
                                their<br/>opinion may conduce to the improvement and
                                per-<br/>fection of the penal code. And that the Commis-<br/>sioners
                                so appointed, be authorized and empowered,<br/>and are hereby
                                authorized and empowered, to send<br/>for persons and papers, and to
                                reduce all examina-<br/>tions and evidences taken by them to
                                writing, and<br/> annex the same to their report.</said></p>
<p>The foregoing resolution was presented to the As-<br/>sembly, passed that
                            House, and was sent to the Se-<br/>nate. I believe it also passed that
                            branch of the<br/>Legislature, but am not informed if
                            Commissioners<br/>have been appointed; if they should be, their
                            report,<br/>I think, might afford interesting matter for your
                            So-<br/>ciety, on the melioration of the penal system. It has<br/>been a
                            favourite object with me for some years past,<br/>to have prisons built
                            in districts throughout the state,<br/>two or three counties to form a
                            district, for solitary<br/> confinement, and divided into rooms six feet
                            by nine,<br/>and to be appropriated solely for the punishment
                            of<br/>minor offences—<emph rend="italic">to be kept perfectly clean and
                                neat</emph>,<br/>and the term of confinement not to exceed sixty
                            or<br/>ninety days; their friends not to be permitted to visit<br/>them,
                            except by special permission in writing, direct-<br/>ed to the keeper of
                            the prison. They should not be<br/>employed at any kind of work, and no
                            book allowed<br/>them except the Bible, or some suitable religious
                            tract. <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_273" n="277"></pb>The plan mentioned by thee of a Reformatory for

                            day, when at work, they will<br/>have keepers constantly with them, and
                                <emph rend="italic">then</emph> it will<br/> be very easy to prevent
                            them talking or having<br/>any improper communication with each
                            other;—if<br/>more than one is in a room at night, they would
                            as-<br/>suredly corrupt each other, and thus your design, or<br/>
                            reformation, must be defeated.</p>
<p>The administration of the New York State Prison<br/>has been very badly
                            managed for many years; the<br/>amount of expenditures are from twenty
                            to thirty<br/>thousand dollars yearly more than the amount
                            pro-<br/>duced by the labour of the convicts. When Friends<br/>had the
                            management, it was entirely different, as<br/>will be seen by my book,
                            published in <date when="1804">1804</date>, a copy<br/>of which was sent
                            thee some time ago. In <a href="/places/phila">Philadel-phia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, the affairs of their State Prison
                            are managed<br/>with much care and prudence, and the profit on
                            the<br/>labour of the convicts is several thousand dollars<br/>more than
                            the cost of support and maintenance.<br/>The friends to the penitentiary
                            system have been<br/>in some degree disappointed as it regards
                            reforma-<br/>tion of the convicts, and this, in my opinion, is
                            entire-<br/>ly owing to the improper construction of our
                            prisons.<br/>The rooms are calculated too large, and in
                            conse-<br/>quence of this, twelve to fifteen are put in each room<br/>at
                            night, and of course they corrupt each other, and<br/>it is not
                            unreasonable to believe that many become<br/>more wicked and
                            incorrigible from their impri-<br/>sonment. The only wise plan then is,
                            for keepers<br/>to be constantly with them during the day whilst<br/>at
                            labour, and at night, let each one be lodged in<br/>separate cells.</p>

                            thou wouldst direct them to be<br/>regularly sent me.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I had the pleasure of writing you on the <date when="1818-02-20">20th
                                of<br/>February</date>, by my friend <a href="/people/jgrei1">Mr.
                                Greig<persname key="jgrei1"></persname></a>, and I have recent-<br/>ly had the satisfaction of
                            learning from him, that the<br/>papers he was so good as to take charge
                            of, were<br/>safely delivered into your hands, and that you were<br/>in
                            good health. You will see by referring to my<br/>Treatise on Indigence,
                            which I sent you, that I was<br/>the first to suggest the establishment
                            of saving banks,<br/>so far back as the year <date when="1806">1806</date>. Happy would it have<br/>been for this country, if
                            this, and my various other<br/>suggestions for the amelioration of
                            society, had been<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_275" n="279"></pb>attended to at the time they were
                            brought forward;<br/>but the public mind in this country, and
                            particularly<br/> the Parliament, do not see good objects quickly.
                            The<br/>proposition was made, when a leading member<br/>brought in a
                            bill for amending the Poor Laws in <date when="1806">1806</date>,<br/>which did not pass the Lower House. Three
                            years<br/>ago, the establishment of local banks for
                            savings<br/>originated in <a href="/places/scot">Scotland<placename key="scot"></placename></a>,
                            and their utility being (as I<br/>had predicted) rendered manifest, they
                            got a footing<br/>in this country. They have recently been
                            recognized<br/>by government, and there are now about two hun-<br/>dred
                            establishments in different parts of <a href="/places/engl">Great
                                Britain<placename key="engl"></placename></a><br/>and <a href="/places/irel">Ireland<placename key="irel"></placename></a>: but as the superintendence is
                            gratui-<br/>tous, and the organization of a nature not to
                            ensure<br/>permanency, (which was the main feature in my<br/>plan,) I
                            doubt their success on the present footing.</p>
<p> A gentleman of the name of <a href="/people/woods1">Woodson<persname key="woods1"></persname></a>,
                            has propo-<br/>sed an improvement. He sent me his pamphlet, (a<br/>copy
                            of which I inclose you,) requesting at the same<br/>time, that my
                            assistance and influence might be<br/>exerted in his behalf. He thought
                            he had made a<br/> new discovery, but was surprised when I
                            showed<br/>him that I had brought forward a similar plan<br/>twelve
                            years ago. I assured him, however, of my<br/> co-operation, and he is
                            now attempting to carry his<br/>plan into effect. If it succeeds, it
                            will be one of the<br/>best establishments which was ever made, for
                            the<br/>purpose of giving provident habits to the poor, and<br/>of
                            rendering them independent of parish relief, which<br/>adds greatly in
                            other respects to their comfort.</p>
<p>Having now reached the seventy-fourth year of my<br/>age, and having
                            resolved, as soon as I can, in conse-<br/>quence of declining health, to
                            resign all my public<br/>laborious situations, and to devote my
                            remaining life<br/>to charitable objects only; in the contemplation
                            of<br/>this retirement, a friend of mine wished to possess<br/>my
                            papers, that he might give a brief view of my<br/>public life. This he
                            has done, and I hasten to send<br/>you a copy of it, from which you will
                            see that I have<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_276" n="280"></pb>not devoted any time to what is called
                                <emph rend="italic">the pleasurable<br/>amusements of life</emph>.
                            In my progress I have encounter-<br/>ed many difficulties, and have
                            subjected myself to<br/>the most excessive labour, stimulated thereto by
                            a<br/>conviction, that success would generate pleasing<br/>reflections.
                            You too, my good sir, have pursued the<br/>same track, perhaps in a
                            greater degree, although you<br/> had not so wide a field: but you
                            exceed me by far,<br/>since to charitable objects you have devoted
                            your<br/>whole time, while mine has been occupied by a<br/>great variety
                            of objects. I trust, however, most of<br/>them have been useful to my
                            fellow citizens.</p>
<p>I had resisted the solicitations of the editor of the<br/>European
                            Magazine, to set forth my portrait, and to<br/>permit him to introduce
                            my biography into his work<br/>for more than twenty years, promising at
                            the same<br/>time, that at a future period (meaning at the close
                            of<br/>life) I would comply with his request. I have now<br/>redeemed
                            the pledge, and the biography now sent<br/>you, will be found in the
                            Magazine for <emph rend="italic"><date when="1818-03">March</date></emph>, <emph rend="italic"><date when="1818-04">April</date></emph>,<br/><emph rend="italic"><date when="1818-05">May</date></emph>, and <emph rend="italic"><date when="1818-06">June</date></emph>, in the present year. Probably
                            the<br/>three first numbers may have found their way to the<br/>United
                            States before this reaches you, the fourth is<br/>not yet published.</p>
<p>Nothing, in my opinion, will cure the excessive<br/>evils arising from
                            the immoderate use of ardent<br/>spirits in your country, (which is even
                            worse than<br/>here,) than the universal diffusion of properly
                            organi-<br/>zed <emph rend="italic">Savings Banks</emph> in each of the
                            states, sanctioned<br/>by <emph rend="italic">legislative
                                regulations</emph>. They are calculated<br/>beyond all other
                            institutions, to give <emph rend="italic">provident habits</emph><br/>to
                            the labouring people. Provident habits never fail<br/>to generate
                            industry, and to promote moral and reli-<br/>gious feelings. In my
                            treatise on Indigence, you<br/>will perceive that I call it to be a
                                <emph rend="italic">god-like work</emph>. All<br/>the regulations
                            and restraints of the legislature, and<br/>all the efforts of the
                            clergy, will, without this great<br/>auxiliary, be of little avail.</p>
<p>Our free schools go on prosperously: but until they<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_277" n="281"></pb>are
                            made <emph rend="italic">completely national</emph>, and not made to
                            de-<br/>pend on voluntary subscriptions, and voluntary
                            super-<br/>intendence, I have my fears as to their permanency.<br/>They
                            should be placed on the footing of those in <a href="/places/scot">Scot-land<placename key="scot"></placename></a>, established in every parish more than a
                            century<br/>and a half ago, to which is to be attributed
                            the<br/>superior moral habits of the labouring classes in that<br/>
                            country beyond all others in <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>.
                            We expended<br/>4000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. raised by
                            subscription, in erecting a new<br/>school in this quarter of <a href="/places/westm1">Westminster<placename key="westm1"></placename></a>, for the educa-<br/>tion of
                            1000 male and female children, which school<br/>I founded in <date when="1803">1803</date>. I send you our last report.</p>
<p>We have in this great metropolis, many useful, and<br/>I am sorry to say,
                            many useless charities, suggested<br/>by benevolent well-meaning
                            persons, whose minds<br/>are not sufficiently enlarged to foresee that
                            the expense<br/>produces little practical results; while others, such
                            as<br/>the hospitals for the sick and diseased, (where the<br/>benefits
                            are unquestionable) are overlooked. Many<br/> of the wards, in the
                            different establishments, are occa-<br/>sionally empty for want of
                            funds; and the admission<br/>of patients, from this circumstance, is
                            precluded.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that the com-<br/>mittee for the

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I wrote thee soon after thy departure from this<br/>country, and once
                            since, and about ten days ago<br/>received thy esteemed favour, dated,
                                <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>, <date when="1818-05-07">5th<br/>month, 7th,</date> which gave the pleasing
                            intelligence of<br/>thy safe arrival. How highly gratified I should
                            be,<br/>by being with thee for a few months, and mixing<br/>with that
                            kind of society, that thou wilt be constant-<br/>ly meeting in thy tour
                            through <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>. As this is<br/>not to
                            be my lot, it would be the next most pleasing<br/>enjoyment, to hear
                            frequently from thee, with very<br/>full details of thy observations on
                            men and things,<br/>in the course of thy travels. I was much
                            pleased<br/>with thy account of <a href="/people/wrosc1">William
                                Roscoe<persname key="wrosc1"></persname></a>, and in conse-<br/>quence of thy recommendation,
                            have put up a large<br/>bundle of pamphlets, amongst which are accounts of<br/>
<a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a> Prisons. Such<br/>a man, engaging with zeal in
                            the cause of humanity,<br/>particularly as it relates to a melioration
                            of the penal<br/>laws of Great Britain, might do wonders. To
                            effect<br/>this, requires patience and perseverance;—the whole<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_279" n="283"></pb> work may be ruined by men, who in <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> are<br/>called Oppositionists or Reformers, (in
                            America, De-<br/>mocrats,) and who, actuated by an overstrained
                            zeal,<br/>do not know how to take hold of things at the right<br/>time;
                            like many religious zealots, they press on the<br/>people more than they
                            are able to bear. The light<br/>with which Providence has been pleased
                            to enlight-<br/>en the minds of men, as it regards moral or
                            reli-<br/>gious truths, is gradual—as was the commencement<br/>of the
                            abolition of slavery. If the good people in<br/><a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>, who are now engaged in endeavouring
                            to<br/>effect an alteration in the penal system, act wisely,<br/>they
                            will be exceedingly prudent and cautious not<br/>to press for too much
                            in their first application—<br/><emph rend="italic">eventually</emph>
                            they <emph rend="italic">must</emph> succeed in so righteous a
                            cause.</p>
<p>I expect thou wilt procure a fund of information,<br/>relating to public
                            institutions, particularly Lunatic<br/>Asylums. I requested of thee, if
                            thou shouldst visit<br/><a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>, to find
                            out, if in thy power, on what account<br/>it is, that <a href="/people/stuke1">Samuel Tuke<persname key="stuke1"></persname></a> seems offended with
                            me—it<br/>may be for my publishing one of his letters to me,<br/> in
                            doing which I conceived it was promoting the<br/>public good by using
                            his name. I am very sorry, if<br/>in any way, his feelings have been
                            hurt, owing to any<br/>part of my conduct.</p>
<p>I hope thou arrived in <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> in time
                            for the<br/> Annual Meeting of the <a href="/organizations/ambib">Bible

                                <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> than with us? The last
                                <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a> print-<br/>ed epistle, was
                            not printed by our yearly meeting as<br/>usual; this was opposed by
                            <a href="/people/ehick1">E. Hicks<persname key="ehick1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/twill1">Willet<persname key="twill1"></persname></a>, and<br/>others of his disciples, on account of
                            it containing<br/>some pointed good remarks, on the observance of
                            the<br/>First Day—it was advocated by <a href="/people/gdill1">G.
                                Dillwyn<persname key="gdill1"></persname></a>, &amp;c. &amp;c.,<br/>but they were obliged to
                            yield, in order to preserve<br/>peace and harmony.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/organizations/spaup">Pauper Society<orgname key="spaup"></orgname></a> does not get forward
                            with any<br/>spirit, and, in my opinion will cease, till thee
                            return<br/>to revive it. I wish <a href="/people/walle1">W.
                                Allen<persname key="walle1"></persname></a> would direct the Phi-<br/>lanthropist to be
                            regularly forwarded to me—I have<br/>had no numbers since those received
                            from thee—I<br/>wrote him about two weeks ago, and sent him
                            some<br/>pamphlets—please return to him my thanks for a<br/>parcel he
                            sent me, which came safe to hand, and<br/>were very acceptable.

                            unexpectedly improving.</p>
<p> Last First Day, <a href="/people/sbett1">Samuel Bettle<persname key="sbett1"></persname></a> preached
                            for us at<br/>Pearl-street about an hour, equal to the best, if
                            not<br/>the best sermon I ever heard delivered—truly ortho-<br/>dox on
                            important doctrines—the language was excel-<br/>lent—his manner of
                            delivery extremely agreeable,—<br/>and a most uncommon solemnity seemed
                            to cover<br/>the whole meeting, equal to any thing of the kind
                            I<br/>ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Absence from the city, and other circumstances,<br/>prevented me sending
                            this as soon as intended. I<br/>have now to mention the decease of our

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>In a late letter from my particular and valuable<br/>friend, <a href="/people/jgris1">John Griscom<persname key="jgris1"></persname></a>, he informed me of the
                            peculiar<br/>gratification he enjoyed in thy company at <a href="/people/liver">Liver-pool<persname key="liver"></persname></a>, and of thy being a warm
                            advocate in favour<br/>of obtaining an alteration of your penal code,
                            and<br/>requested me to forward thee some printed accounts<br/>of the
                            Penitentiary system in this country. It is with<br/>much pleasure that I
                            comply with my friends request,<br/>and now send to care of Cropper,
                            Benson, &amp; Co., a<br/>bundle containing several pamphlets relating to
                            our<br/>prisons, and have added some others that I conceived<br/>would
                            be interesting to thee. We have in this state<br/>two large prisons, one
                            in this city that has about 750<br/>convicts, and one at <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>, (about 150 miles west<br/>of
                                <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>,) built last year, that
                            will accommodate<br/>about the same number. The affairs of the
                            prison<br/>in this city have been badly managed for some years.<br/>That
                            punishments <emph rend="italic">mild</emph> and certain will more
                            effect-<br/>ually prevent crimes, than those which are sangui-<br/>nary
                            and severe, there can be no doubt; and this<br/>would have been most
                            completely verified, if the<br/>plan of our prisons had been adapted to
                            the design<br/>and intention of our Penitentiary system; they
                            should<br/>have been so built, that each convict might be con-<br/>fined
                            at night in a <emph rend="italic">separate</emph> room—say six by
                            eight<br/> feet—but unfortunately the rooms, in all our prisons<br/>are
                            calculated for eight to fourteen prisoners, so that<br/>when they are
                            lodged together at night, they have<br/>full opportunity to corrupt each
                            other, and most fre-<br/>quently come out of prison more hardened
                            and<br/>depraved than when they entered it. During the<br/>day, whilst
                            employed at work, and at their meals,<br/> as keepers are constantly
                            with them, it is very easy<br/>to prevent them conversing with each
                            other; and if,<br/>at night, each of them were confined in a
                            separate<br/>room, there would be some good chance for
                            reforma-<br/>tion; indeed, in this way the punishment would be<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_282" n="286"></pb>more severely felt, and the term of imprisonment<br/>might
                            be shortened. I interested myself in vain<br/>with our government, to
                            have the prison lately built<br/>at <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>, divided throughout into rooms, to
                            accom-<br/>modate only one prisoner; they however agreed to<br/>have 140
                            such rooms, in order to keep separate the<br/>most abandoned characters.
                            In a late conversation<br/>with our Governor, he regretted very much
                            that the<br/> prison had not been built agreeably to the
                            plan<br/>recommended by me. I am perfectly satisfied that<br/>until all
                            our prisons are on this plan, the expecta-<br/>tions of those who are
                            desirous of a rational reform<br/>will not be answered. If you should
                            succeed in<br/>obtaining an alteration of your penal laws, it
                            would<br/>be a fortunate circumstance, if your prisons should<br/>be
                            calculated throughout on the plan of rooms to<br/>lodge one person.</p>
<p>I inclose thee a printed copy of a paper read before<br/>the Governors of

                            have now the satisfaction to state,<br/>that they have purchased
                            thirty-four acres of land,<br/>near the city, and have commenced ereting
                            a build-<br/> ing for the accommodation of 300 insane patients,
                            and<br/>intend to pursue the same mild plan of treatment<br/>as adopted

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to express my<br/>grateful
                            acknowledgments for your valuable commu-<br/>nication of Reports and
                            Documents respecting your<br/>state prisons and other institutions,
                            which have<br/>arrived at a moment when they will be of
                            important<br/>service to me, in a publication which I intend
                            short-<br/>ly to send to press, on the state of our criminal
                            law,<br/>and the reformation of offenders.</p>
<p>I have observed with great concern, the unfavoura-<br/>ble change which
                            seems to have taken place in these<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_284" n="288"></pb>establishments on
                            your side the Atlantic, and am<br/>convinced, from the best
                            consideration I can give the<br/>subject, that they are occasioned, in a
                            great degree,<br/>by the causes mentioned in your letter—the
                            inade-<br/>quacy of the buildings, and the want of
                            separate<br/>apartments at night for the convicts; but,
                            independ-<br/>ent of this, there are other circumstances
                            which<br/>appear to me to be of great importance, and which<br/>I intend
                            to state pretty much at large. I hope in<br/>the course of six or eight
                            weeks to be enabled to<br/>send you a copy of my publication, in which I
                            have<br/>the pleasure to think you will find a close conformity<br/>to
                            your own opinions and recommendations, so<br/>clearly stated, and so
                            strikingly enforced, in some of<br/>the works with which you have
                            favoured me.</p>
<p>I shall only at present beg leave further to observe,<br/>that I am sorry
                            to find some indications of an inten-<br/>tion on the part of your
                            managers, to abolish the<br/>power of pardoning criminals, and to render
                            punish-<br/>ment <emph rend="italic">certain</emph> as <emph rend="italic">to duration</emph>—a measure which, as it<br/>appears
                            to me, would put an end to Penitentiary<br/>establishments altogether.
                            That this power may<br/>have been indiscreetly used, is possible, but it
                            is not<br/><emph rend="italic">the sending convicts out</emph>, but the
                                <emph rend="italic">receiving them in again</emph>,<br/>that
                            occasions the evil complained of, as I hope you<br/>will see stated in
                            the sheets I shall send you.</p>
<p>Our good friend, <a href="/people/jgris1">Mr. Griscom<persname key="jgris1"></persname></a>, is
                            travelling on the<br/>continent of <a href="/places/euro">Europe<placename key="euro"></placename></a>, with another friend of mine,<br/>and I believe
                            intends to make a visit to <a href="/places/italy">Italy<placename key="italy"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>I think myself happy in being favoured with this<br/> friendly
                            interchange of opinion, with one whose<br/>attention has been so long,
                            and so successfully devo<br/>ted to the subject. And with sincere esteem
                            and<br/>attachment, remain, Dear Sir, your much obliged<br/>and faithful
                            friend,</p>

<p><a href="/people/dogde1">David A. Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a> holds the pre-emption
                            right of pur-<br/>chasing all the Indian reservations in our state.
                            He<br/>is very desirous the Indians should remove to the<br/>Westward,
                            and sell to him their reservations. These<br/>Indians west of <geogname key="genes2">Genessee River</geogname>, have heen under<br/>the care
                            of <a href="/organizations/pym">Friends<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, and they have<br/>uniformly advised the
                            Indians not to remove. <a href="/people/dogde1">Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a><br/>prevailed on <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a> to address to him a letter<br/>which he then
                            communicated to the Indians.</p>
<p>One <a href="/people/jhyde1">Jabez Hyde<persname key="jhyde1"></persname></a>, a Presbyterian minister
                            or school-<br/>master, residing among them, published the letter.<br/>
                            When we met our <a href="/organizations/pym">Friends<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, we found<br/>their minds much
                            soured and prejudiced against<br/>government, and particularly against
                            the Secretary<br/>at War; they asked, why should any confidence
                            be<br/>placed in men who would talk so smooth to us, and<br/>at the same
                            time write a letter, with a view to have<br/>it shown to the Indians,
                            stating that Friends <said who="undetermined">were<br/>their worst
                                enemies.</said> It did not serve to alter the<br/>opinion so
                            strongly taken up by them, that we urged<br/>our own belief, and that of
                                <a href="/people/tmckin1">T. McKenney<persname key="tmckin1"></persname></a>, that <a href="/people/jcalh1">Cal-houn<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a> did not intend any way to
                            allude to Friends.<br/>We believed, we told them, that <a href="/people/dogde1">Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a> had stated to<br/><a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a>, that a number of whites residing
                            near the<br/>Indians, constantly urged them not to remove, and<br/>who,
                            by trade and artifice, got from the Indians, every<br/> year, the amount
                            of the annuities paid them by go-<br/>vernment; and thus it became the
                            interest of this class<br/>of people, to use every means in their power
                            to per-<br/>suade the Indians not to remove. In making such<br/>a
                            representation, <a href="/people/dogde1">Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a> induced
                                <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a> to write<br/>this letter.
                            I am satisfied that he (<a href="/people/dogde1">Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a>)
                            never<br/>mentioned to the <a href="/people/jcalh1">Secretary<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a>
                            that <emph rend="italic">Friends</emph> had advised<br/>the Indians to
                            remain on their lands—it would have<br/>been bad policy for him to have
                            urged such senti-<br/>ments. In short, I do not believe <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a> thought<br/>of Friends when he wrote
                            the letter. It is probably<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_286" n="290"></pb>true, that at that time,
                            government supposed it would<br/>be for the interest of the Indians of
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> to<br/>remove to the
                            borders of the <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>; but I
                            am<br/> well convinced they have changed their sentiments,<br/>and that
                            now they agree most decidedly with us, that<br/>the Indians ought to
                            remain on their reservations.</p>
<p>We found that <a href="/organizations/pym">Friends<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a>, at their last
                                <a href="/organizations/pymsufferings">meeting forsufferings<orgname key="pymsufferings"></orgname></a>,
                            held in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, appointed a

                            some<br/>Friends in a few days will be appointed to attend<br/>Congress
                            with it. From the representation we made<br/>to them of our kind
                            reception at <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, and<br/>our
                            urging that we had full confidence in the assu-<br/>rance given to us of
                            the kind disposition of the <a href="/people/jmonr1">Presi-dent<persname key="jmonr1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/tmckin1">McKenney<persname key="tmckin1"></persname></a>,
                            &amp;c., their minds seemed to<br/>be in some degree softened—still they
                            seemed as if<br/>they could not be reconciled to <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a>'s letter to<br/><a href="/people/dogde1">Ogden<persname key="dogde1"></persname></a>. Owing to people coming in, and
                            constantly<br/>interrupting me, it is with difficulty I write,
                            but<br/>thought it was best to give you these hints—you may<br/>consider
                            if it would be proper for you to address a<br/>confidential letter to
                                <a href="/people/tmckin1">McKenney<persname key="tmckin1"></persname></a>, requesting an
                            expla-<br/>nation of <a href="/people/jcalh1">Calhoun<persname key="jcalh1"></persname></a>'s letter,
                            and probably our <a href="/places/phila">Phila-delphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>
<a href="/organizations/pym">Friends<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> prejudices might be removed.</p>

                            Prison of <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> for <date when="1815">1815</date> (which<br/>contains so many of your
                            excellent remarks) entire.</p>
<p>From the portion of my tract which relates to this<br/>country, you will
                            perceive, that we are not insensible<br/>to the great importance of the
                            penitentiary system,<br/>and that some idea of such a plan has been
                            enter-<br/>tained, even from a remote period; but <emph rend="italic">that</emph> which has<br/>always been wanting, has been to place it
                            on a pro-<br/>per ground, and to substitute a system of
                            benevolence<br/>and reformation for one of revenge and punishment.</p>
<p>If this can be fully effected, every thing else will<br/>naturally flow
                            from it, as from a parent stream; and<br/>from the united efforts that
                            are making in almost<br/>every civilized part of the world, and the free
                            com-<br/>munication of sentiments between those who are<br/>earnest in
                            the cause, I trust that such a foundation<br/>will be laid for the moral
                            improvement of mankind,<br/>as may allow us to indulge the warmest hopes
                            of a<br/>speedy and happy result.</p>
<p>The publications you were so good as to send me,<br/>were of the highest
                            value, as they show, by a variety<br/>of experiments, not only what
                            ought to be done in<br/>establishing a penitentiary system, but what
                            ought<br/>to be <emph rend="italic">avoided</emph>. On this head, you
                            will see I have<br/>expressed myself with great freedom, and will,
                            per-<br/>haps, think I have been more ready to blame than<br/>to
                            commend. If, however, I have written without<br/>reserve, I have also
                            endeavoured to give reasons for<br/>my opinions; and it would give me
                            the greatest plea-<br/>sure, if any suggestions of mine should be
                            thought<br/> worthy the attention of those in your country, who<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_288" n="292"></pb>interest themselves in the promotion of these
                            most<br/>important and benevolent plans.</p>
<p>Accept, once more, my sincere thanks for your kind<br/> attentions, and
                            believe me, with the most grateful<br/>respect and attachment, Dear

<salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I duly received thy kind favour, dated <date when="1819-02-20">20th
                                Febru-<br/>ary</date>, accompanied with two copies of thy Treatise
                            on<br/>Penal Jurisprudence, &amp;c., which were truly accept-<br/>able;
                            and, from a careful perusal of the work, am<br/>well satisfied it will
                            be extensively useful in your<br/>country, and also in the United
                            States. I had some<br/> expectation that an edition would have been
                            printed<br/>here, but in this have I been disappointed. If a
                            few<br/>copies could be sent by Robinson, bookseller, <a href="/places/liver">Liver-pool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>, to James Eastburn &amp;
                            Co., booksellers in this<br/>city, they might be readily sold, and I am
                            well satis-<br/>fied would be of great use, as they would, no
                            doubt,<br/>be generally read by the members of our legislature,<br/>at
                            their next session in <date when="1820-01">January</date>. The subject
                            relating<br/>to the affairs of our penitentiary system, &amp;c.,
                            will<br/>then be before them. The success of the establish-<br/>ments in
                                <a href="/places/boston">Boston<placename key="boston"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/newje">New Jersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>,<br/>and, I believe, in <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, has been equal to the<br/>warmest
                            expectations of our friends; but, in this<br/>state, every thing has
                            been sadly mismanaged for<br/>some years past. In <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, a prison is build-<br/>ing, calculated to
                            lodge each convict in a separate<br/> room, and I am in hopes we shall
                            have one erected<br/>on this plan in this state. I am satisfied, that
                            until<br/>our prisons are all <emph rend="italic">so</emph> built, we
                            shall never have the<br/>system pei feet. My sentiments on this are
                            fully men-<br/>tioned in the first letter I had the pleasure of
                            address-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_289" n="293"></pb>ing to thee. I expect shortly a

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I am gratified at the interest you take in our In-<br/>dian concerns, and
                            thank you for your letter of the<br/><date when="1819-03-03">3d
                                inst.</date>, and for the pamphlet which accompanied it.</p>
<p>I have not yet learned the views of the President,<br/>respecting the
                            application of the 10,000 dollars, ap-<br/>propriated near the close of
                            the late session of Con-<br/>gress, to aid in the business of Indian
                            improvement.<br/>My own opinion is, (and it is only my opinion,)
                            that<br/>it will be applied through the benevolent agencies<br/>which
                            are, or may be, put in operation; and at such<br/> points as it shall be
                            likely to do the most good, ac-<br/>cording to the intentions of the act
                            of Congress.<br/>Those establishments, so it strikes me, will be
                            recog-<br/>nized as most in accordance with this view, that are,<br/> or
                            may be, organized <emph rend="italic">in the Indian country</emph>;
                            and<br/>which embrace the two branches of improvement,<br/>implied in
                                <emph rend="italic">letters</emph> and the <emph rend="italic">agricultural arts</emph>, united<br/>also with a system of <emph rend="italic">moral improvement</emph>. This par-<br/>ticular
                            application, it strikes me, will be, as the sum<br/>is, to the number of
                            Indian children taken in by<br/>these liberal associations of men for
                            education. Thus,<br/>if there be ten schools of instruction, for
                            example, in<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_290" n="294"></pb>the Indian country, averaging each one
                            hundred chil-<br/>dren, there will be one thousand dollars for
                            each<br/>establishment.</p>
<p>The amount appropriated is so small, when com-<br/>pared with the object
                            of general or universal im-<br/>provement, that, to make it useful, it
                            can be used<br/>only as an auxiliary to the resources which
                            indivi-<br/>dual bounty has provided. I will just name one<br/>school in
                            the <a href="/organizations/cherokee">Cherokee<orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a> country, in charge of the
                            good<br/>Mr. <a href="/people/gambo1">Gambold<persname key="gambo1"></persname></a>. He is labouring,
                            and has been for<br/>fourteen years, in this generous cause; and his
                            plans<br/>have not been developed, nor his scale of
                            usefulness<br/>extended to its limits, for lack of pecuniary
                            resources.<br/>Five and six children are as many as his means
                            have<br/>ever enabled him to instruct. I don't know what his<br/>
                            resources are, but I will suppose them to be at the<br/>rate of fifty
                            dollars per annum for each child; and,<br/>suppose he can educate and
                            instruct out of his own<br/>means, in the various branches of
                            improvement which<br/>his school embraces, only five children; and
                            suppose<br/>it shall turn out, in the general estimate, that a
                            hun-<br/>dred dollars can be applied, out of the 10,000
                            appro-<br/>priated, for each child,—that would enable Mr. <a href="/people/gambo1">Gam-bold<persname key="gambo1"></persname></a> to take fifteen children, or
                            ten more than the<br/>number to which, I suppose, he has been
                            hitherto<br/> confined. I merely refer to this case, as being
                            the<br/>first that has struck me; and to this mode of
                            illus-<br/>tration, without knowing what plan the President<br/>may
                            adopt. I incline to the opinion, however, that<br/>his contemplated tour
                            may prevent him from doing<br/>more than acquire a collection of
                            information appli-<br/>cable to the case, against his return.</p>
<p> It seems you have, in the state of <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, 4976<br/>Indians, and that these Indians have
                            271,323 acres of<br/>land as reservations. I am glad they are so well
                            off<br/>in the land way. How would it sort with your con-<br/>venience
                            to let me know, how many schools for im-<br/>provement are organized in
                            their settlements, exclu-<br/>sively for Indian education? and where
                            located?—<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_291" n="295"></pb>and how many children are attached to
                            each of them?<br/>and, as far as you may be able, what state of
                            im-<br/>provement they are in. In truth, my good friend, I<br/>look to
                            the Indian <emph rend="italic">children</emph> for the realization
                            of<br/> Indian civilization. The main efforts should be made<br/>to
                            apply to them. The old ones are like the moun-<br/>tain oaks, (here and
                            there some exceptions,) and it<br/>were an almost hopeless task to
                            attempt their con-<br/>formity with civilized life. But they must soon
                            die<br/>off—such is nature's decree; and if vigorous measures<br/>be
                            adopted for <emph rend="italic">the children</emph>, they will, when
                            they<br/>arrive at maturity, appear like the vernal year, in<br/>
                            contrast with the barrenness of a recent winter pros-<br/>pect. My wish
                            is, that the principles of improvement<br/>be extended to as many Indian
                            children as they can<br/>be made to reach. They are the virgin soil—the
                            seeds<br/>sown in them will grow, be they bad or good.</p>
<p>I am sure the President would be gratified to recog-<br/>nize your
                            recommendation of agents to go amongst<br/>the <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> Indians, if it shall come within
                            his<br/>scheme to make such appointments. It is certain you<br/>would
                            name none, but such as would promote the<br/>great object of their
                            civilization and improvement.</p>
<p> The Indians at <a href="/organizations/allegany">Allegany<orgname key="allegany"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondago<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a> are in a<br/>fair way. They have
                            banished the greatest evil, the<br/>small-pox not excepted, that ever
                            desolated any peo-<br/>ple. It is literally <emph rend="italic">the
                                Indians' curse</emph>. In excluding<br/>ardent spirits, they have
                            got the top upon Pandora's<br/>box, and may a kind Providence help them
                            to keep<br/> it there!</p>
<p>It would be gratifying all round, no doubt, to pro-<br/>mote the views
                            embraced in your suggestions; and,<br/>if the principle of distribution
                            shall be adopted, the<br/><a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>
                            Indians will get, through the benevolent<br/>channels, where I think it
                            likely it will be all made<br/>to flow, some portion of this small sum.
                            The appoint-<br/>ment of an agent or two, as you suggest, is a
                            good<br/>plan; especially as the <a href="/places/newyo">New
                                York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> Indians are in so<br/>many separate clans; for then
                            the agent could super-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_292" n="296"></pb>intend the improvement of them
                            all more generally,<br/>by going amongst them, and counselling them
                            accord-<br/>ing to your plan. But will it not cost an <emph rend="italic">over</emph> pro-<br/>portion of the appropriation in
                                <emph rend="italic">that</emph> direction, if $1600<br/>be
                            necessary?—especially as these Indians are doing<br/> so much better
                            than many others, in every way. Or<br/>would not $1600 for 4976 Indians,
                            leave too small a<br/>sum to go to the four nations on our borders,
                            whose<br/>numbers may be estimated at 100,000? This may go<br/>to show
                            the propriety of using this appropriation as<br/>an <emph rend="italic">auxiliary</emph> to existing organizations, where its<br/>effects
                            may tell upon a congregation of children, and<br/>give means to increase
                            their numbers, or power to<br/>confer additional improvements upon those
                            already<br/> admitted. For I think (for myself) the children
                            should<br/>be the subjects of our <emph rend="italic">special</emph>
                            care. This, however, is<br/>not intended to exclude the Indian children
                            in <a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> from their proportion
                            of benefits; and hence,<br/>I have suggested that you favour me with the
                            infor-<br/>mation I have referred to. But all this is my own<br/>first
                            thinking, very hastily thrown together, not one<br/>point of which may
                            be adopted in the regulations<br/>which shall be finally made.</p>
<p>I will cheerfully lay any communication you may<br/>make on this subject
                            before the Secretary of War,<br/> who will be the organ to the President
                            in this matter.</p>
<p>I have sent after a copy of <a href="/people/jheck1">Heckwelder<persname key="jheck1"></persname></a>'s book. No<br/>doubt I shall enjoy it, and derive
                            benefit from it, in<br/>the way of information.</p>

<salute>MY GOOD FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I have thought much on the great subjects talked<br/>over at our late
                            interesting and very pleasant inter-<br/>view at your house. I have
                            since conversed with<br/>many distinguished gentlemen in your city, on
                            board<br/>the steam boat, and in the city of <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, particu-<br/>larly with the <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jtayl4">Lieutenant
                                Governor<persname key="jtayl4"></persname></a>, and<br/>Mr. <a href="/people/svanr1">Van
                                Rensselaer<persname key="svanr1"></persname></a>, (the Patroon)—all enter very<br/>heartily
                            into our views. The <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, and Mr.
                                <a href="/people/svanr1">VanRensselaer<persname key="svanr1"></persname></a>, are both going
                            in a few days to <a href="/places/nycit">NewYork<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, on a
                            visit of several weeks. I expect to meet<br/>them there. They will be
                            pleased to have a con-<br/>ference with you on the subjects which
                            interests us,<br/>and them also. The <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a> suggested the idea of<br/>having a meeting,
                            after my return to your city, of a<br/>number of gentlemen, who are like
                            minded with our-<br/>selves, and of intelligence and influence, to
                            confer on<br/> the best measures to ripen our plans, and to
                            carry<br/>them into effect. Mr. <a href="/people/svanr1">Van
                                Rensselaer<persname key="svanr1"></persname></a> will be present,<br/>and will probably be
                            willing to go on to <a href="/places/wash">Washing-ton<placename key="wash"></placename></a>
                            this winter, and aid in effecting our purposes<br/>there, particularly
                            in forming a new association<br/>which you suggested, of all
                            denominations, to do<br/>every thing for the Indians, except introducing
                                <emph rend="italic">parti-<br/>cular</emph> religious instruction.
                            This plan, I think, will<br/>take. I think I shall make an effort to go
                            myself<br/>to <a href="/places/wash">Washington<placename key="wash"></placename></a>, and hope, by
                            all means, you, my<br/>friend, will calculate to go—and then we shall
                            feel<br/>strong. The object is a great and good one, and<br/>worthy a
                            great effort. It opens here very auspicious-<br/>ly, and I am full of
                            hope.</p>
<p>I write after the fatigues of the day, in the bustle of<br/>a public
                            house—but I will make no farther apology.</p>

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Thy very obliging favour of <date when="1818-06-24">June 24th,
                                1818</date>, was<br/>received some time since, and to which I should
                            have<br/>replied before this, but delayed, because I wished to<br/>make
                            some communication relating to the objects<br/>that particularly claim
                            the attention of your respecta-<br/>ble society. Some of the prisons
                            established in Ame-<br/>rica have not answered the expectation of the
                            advo-<br/>cates for the penitentiary system, most of whom<br/>were led
                            to believe, that the avails of the labour of<br/>the convicts would be
                            sufficient to defray <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the ex-<br/>penses
                            of their maintenance, &amp;c. This has certainly<br/>not been the fact
                            as to the State Prison in <placename rend="newyo">New
                            York</placename>,<br/>owing entirely to the appointment of persons,
                            who<br/>have had the management of its concerns, not being<br/>rightly
                            qualified for executing the duties required of<br/>them. The consequence
                            of this has been, that the<br/>expense of supporting that prison has
                            been very con-<br/>siderable. However, considering the great
                            advan-<br/>tage contemplated to result from the penitentiary<br/>system,
                            the mere expense is a matter of secondary<br/>consideration. Yet
                            experience has proved in <a href="/places/newje">NewJersey<placename key="newje"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>, and <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>, that<br/>under prudent direction and good
                            management, the<br/>profits on the labour of the convicts will produce
                            suf-<br/>ficient to pay all the necessary expenses of their
                            sup-<br/>port, &amp;c. I think the best conducted penitentiary<br/>we
                            have in America is at <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. 1
                            visited that<br/>prison a few months ago, and was highly gratified
                            in<br/>observing the order, cleanliness, regularity, and in-<br/>dustry
                            of the prisoners. I never visited any institu-<br/>tion that exhibited
                            such a perfect degree of cleanli-<br/>ness, decency, and regularity,
                            throughout its whole<br/>concerns, as the <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>prison, the effects of which<br/>were
                            evidently marked in the countenance and gene-<br/> ral deportment of the
                            convicts. The present very<br/>promising state of the <a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a> penitentiary is ow-<br/>ing to the
                            excellent management of their Board of In-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_295" n="299"></pb>spectors,
                            which is composed of gentlemen of the first<br/>character in the city of
                                <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>. The
                            institution<br/>is also much indebted to the judicious care and
                            good<br/>conduct of the present keeper, who is an active
                            and<br/>intelligent man. I requested him to send me a direct<br/>account
                            of the expenditures, &amp;c. of the prison for the<br/>last year, which
                            I have received from him, forward-<br/>ed me by one of the Inspectors a
                            few days ago; and<br/>believing that this document may be interesting
                            to<br/>your Society, I have had it copied, and now inclose it.</p>
<p>There is one remark respecting the penitentiary<br/>system, which I beg
                            leave to mention. <emph rend="italic">No</emph> benefit, as<br/>it
                            regards <emph rend="italic">reformation</emph>, ever has been, <emph rend="italic">nor ever will be</emph><br/>produced, unless our
                            prisons are calculated to have<br/>separate rooms, six feet by eight
                            feet, so as that every<br/>man can be lodged <emph rend="italic">by
                                himself</emph>. If, as is common,<br/>twelve to twenty are lodged at
                            night in one room,<br/>they surely will corrupt each other, and leave
                            the<br/>prison far more depraved than when they entered it.<br/> I think
                            there is good reason to believe that our legis-<br/>lature will direct
                            the state prison in this city to be<br/>sold next year, and order a new
                            one to be built, to<br/>be divided in rooms of six by eight feet each.
                            I<br/> would further observe, that during the day, when
                            the<br/>prisoners are employed at their work, they are, of<br/>course,
                            constantly under the immediate eye of a<br/>keeper, and no improper
                            intercourse or conversation<br/> can take place. At <a href="/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, (<a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>,) a pri-<br/>son, on the plan of separate
                            rooms for each convict,<br/>is now building, and I am told they intend
                            erecting<br/>a similar one in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. Several years ago, I<br/>mentioned to my
                            friend, <a href="/people/pcolq1">P. Colquhoun<persname key="pcolq1"></persname></a>, of <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>,<br/>that no reformation could
                            possibly be expected from<br/>the operation of the penitentiary system,
                            unless the<br/>prisons were built on a plan for the convicts to be<br/>
                            separately lodged at night, and I think he stated that<br/>some in
                                <a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a> were on that construction,
                            but in<br/>his late letters to me he is silent on the subject of
                            pri-<br/>sons. I am told that there is a prison in the environs<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_296" n="300"></pb>of <a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, built to
                            accommodate seven hundred<br/>prisoners, and each lodged in a room seven
                            by nine<br/>feet. If this is a fact, I should be much gratified
                            by<br/>having some account of it. My friend <a href="/people/walle1">WilliamAllen<persname key="walle1"></persname></a>, some time since, wrote me that it was
                            propo-<br/>sed to build a prison solely for lads under
                            eighteen<br/>years of age, to be called a Reformatory, but I
                            have<br/>not heard if this has been completed.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/organizations/spaup">Society for the Prevention of
                                Pauperism<orgname key="spaup"></orgname></a>, has<br/> appointed a committee to consider of
                            the present<br/>state of our prisons, &amp;c. The committee will

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I beg leave to return you a thousand thanks for<br/>your very obliging
                            letter of the <date when="1820-11-14">14th instant</date>.</p>
<p>I am writing an argument on the subject of the<br/> canal policy of this
                            state, to vindicate myself against<br/>a scandalous charge I met with in
                            the first number<br/>of Tacitus; which is understood to have been
                            either<br/>written by <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor

<p>Your letter speaks of a particular fact, in relation<br/>to the Canal

<p>My argument will go to the press to-morrow or<br/>next day, but it will

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I am extremely desirous of obtaining some inform-<br/>ation of an
                            establishment at <a href="/places/avers">Aversa<placename key="avers"></placename></a>, near
                                <a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a>,<br/>which, I am told, is
                            solely for the accommodation of<br/>Lunatics. As I have no acquaintance
                            with any per-<br/>son residing at <a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a>, from whom I could procure<br/>the information
                            wanted, I applied to my friend,<br/><a href="/people/sgrel1">Stephen
                                Grellet<persname key="sgrel1"></persname></a>, who immediately mentioned to me<br/>thy name,
                            and stated, from his personal acquaint-<br/>ance, he was well assured of
                            thy benevolence and<br/>kindness, and that I might take the liberty of
                            address-<br/>ing a letter to thee on the subject of my inquiry.
                            This,<br/>I hope, will be kindly received, as an apology for
                            my<br/>taking this freedom.</p>
<p>It is said, that the mode of treatment towards the<br/>patients at
                                <a href="/places/avers">Aversa<placename key="avers"></placename></a>, is replete with tender
                            and affec-<br/>tionate care and attention, in place of the harsh,
                            cruel,<br/>and rigorous treatment, that has heretofore
                            been<br/>administered towards Lunatic patients. This mode,<br/>called
                                <said who="undetermined">moral treatment,</said> has been pursued
                            with great<br/>success, at an Asylum called the Retreat, near <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>,<br/>(<a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>,) under the care of the society of
                            Friends,<br/>for the accommodation of the members of their
                            own<br/>society. Near this city we have just completed a<br/>large
                            handsome building, exclusively for Lunatics,<br/>which will accommodate
                            more than 200 patients;<br/> attached to it is about eighty acres of
                            land, orna-<br/>mented with extensive gravel walks,
                            shrubberies,<br/>gardens, green-house, &amp;c. Here it is intended
                            to<br/>employ the patients in Horticulture and Agriculture,<br/>also to
                            afford them every rational amusement. I<br/>have been one of the
                            governors of the <a href="/places/newyh">New
                                YorkHospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> for many years; and about four years
                            ago,<br/>introduced to them, a proposition to establish an<br/>Asylum
                            about six miles from the city, solely for<br/>Lunatic Patients, on the
                            plan of <said who="undetermined">moral treatment,</said><br/>as pursued
                            at the Retreat near <a href="/places/york2">York<placename key="york2"></placename></a>.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_299" n="303"></pb>
<p>The governors adopted the proposed plan, and<br/>have expended on the
                            building, land, &amp;c., $150,000.<br/>It is very desirable, that the
                            managers of this concern<br/>should be as perfect as possible, and I am
                            therefore<br/>induced to crave thy kind aid, in procuring for me
                            a<br/>general and ample account respecting the establish-<br/>ment at
                                <a href="/places/avers">Aversa<placename key="avers"></placename></a>; as to the general mode of
                            treating<br/>the patients, diet, employment, &amp;c. I am very
                            fear-<br/>ful of giving thee too much trouble, but perhaps much<br/>may
                            be saved, if printed accounts could be procured.<br/>They might readily
                            be translated in this city. I<br/>have made up a package containing
                            accounts of some<br/>of our benevolent institutions of this city.
                            Also<br/>reports relating to the grand canal, which is intend-<br/>ed to
                            open a communication between <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>
                            and<br/>the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogname>, a distance of
                            325 miles.</p>
<p>It is three years since this great work was com-<br/>menced, and already
                            one hundred miles are comple-<br/>ted; near one hundred more is this
                            year in such a<br/>state of forwardness, that it will also be
                            completed<br/> early next year. The whole extent, 325 miles,
                            will<br/>probably be finished by the year <date when="1824">1824</date>.
                            The cost of<br/>this great undertaking, (from <geogname key="lakee">Erie</geogname> to the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson</geogname>)<br/> will be about five millions of dollars. I send
                            thee a<br/>small map, which will serve to show the route of
                            the<br/>canal.</p>
<p>There are three American young gentlemen who<br/>expect to visit
                                <a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a> next spring; <a href="/people/wwood2">William CharningWoodbridge<persname key="wwood2"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/ctuth1">Cornelius Tuthill<persname key="ctuth1"></persname></a>, and <a href="/people/tdwig1">Theodore Dwight,junr.<persname key="tdwig1"></persname></a>; their connexions
                            in this country are very<br/>respectable. These young men, on getting to
                                <a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a><br/>will probably wait on
                            thee, as I have requested their<br/>connexion to desire they would do
                            so, as it will afford<br/>an opportunity for thee to send any dispatches
                            thou<br/> mayest have for America. Any attention shown by<br/>thee to
                            these young men, will be most gratefully<br/>acknowledged by their
                            friends, and also confer on<br/>me a singular obligation.</p>

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>Having been informed that it is thy intention to<br/>publish some account
                            of the inland navigation of our<br/>state, and of the progress made in
                            improving it since<br/><date when="1792">1792</date>; and being
                            requested by our mutual friends —,<br/>to communicate to thee, how far,
                            in my opinion, the<br/>statements made by <a href="/people/ewats1">Elkanah
                                Watson<persname key="ewats1"></persname></a>, contained in<br/>his book, entitled, the
                                <q>History of the Rise and Progress<br/>of the Western Canals,</q>
                            are correct; I shall submit<br/>the following observations. I have no
                            doubt of the<br/>fact, that it was in consequence of <a href="/people/ewats1">Elkanah Watson<persname key="ewats1"></persname></a><br/>having communicated to
                                <a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a> the
                            obser-<br/>vations he had made during his tour to the western<br/>part
                            of the state in <date when="1791">1791</date>, and particularly as to
                            the<br/>great benefits that would result by improving the<br/><geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk River</geogname>, and opening a canal
                            communication<br/>at <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, to
                                <geogname key="woodc">Wood Creek</geogname>, and from thence to<br/>
                            improve the navigation to the <geogname key="senec">Seneca
                                Lake</geogname>, that first<br/>turned the attention of <a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a> to these<br/>important
                            objects, and induced him to offer to the<br/><a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>, the act incorporating the Western and
                            North-<br/>ern Inland Lock Navigation Companies. Indeed,<br/><a href="/people/pschu1">General Schuyler<persname key="pschu1"></persname></a>, about the year <date when="1790">1790</date>, often men-<br/>tioned this fact to me; and
                            during the remainder of<br/>his life, I several times accompanied him,
                            in examin-<br/>ing the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk River</geogname>,
                            and westward, as far as the<br/><geogname key="senec">Seneca
                                Lake</geogname>, with a view to ascertain the practica-<br/>bility
                            of improvements by canal navigation, &amp;c.<br/>The Western Canal
                            Company expended a vast sum<br/>of money in improving the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname>, &amp;c. and being<br/>well satisfied
                            that the stockholders would not consent<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_301" n="305"></pb>to advance any further sums, for making improve-<br/>ments
                            west of the <geogname key="oneil">Oneida Lake</geogname>, I called on
                                <a href="/people/jplat1">JudgePlatt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a> one evening at
                                <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, in <date when="1810">1810</date>, and mentioned<br/>to him the propriety of proposing to
                            the legislature,<br/>to appoint commissioners to explore the country
                            as<br/>far west as the <geogname key="senec">Seneca Lake</geogname>, and
                            to report their<br/>opinion, how far it was practicable to connect that
                            lake<br/>by a canal with the <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson
                                River</geogname>; and stated, that<br/>from my own knowledge of the
                            face of the country,<br/>I was perfectly satisfied a favourable report
                            would be<br/> made, and that, considering the immense advantage<br/>that
                            would result to the state by such an undertaking,<br/>there could be no
                            doubt the legislature would readily<br/>be induced to adopt the
                            plan.</p>
<p><a href="/people/jplat1">Judge Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a> was at this time a member
                            of the Sen-<br/>ate, and being well acquainted with the geography<br/>of
                            the state, readily agreed with me in sentiment,<br/>but he remarked,
                            that if commissioners were appoint-<br/>ed, they ought to be directed to
                            explore and examine<br/>the country as far as <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogname>, to ascertain if it was<br/>practicable, to connect
                            that lake by canal naviga-<br/>tion with <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson
                                River</geogname>. I replied, that I was fear-<br/>ful the
                            legislature would be deterred from making any<br/>appointment of
                            commissioners, if so great an under-<br/>taking should be proposed, and
                            that by proposing for<br/>them to examine the country only as far as the
                                <geogname key="senec">Sene-<br/>ca Lake</geogname>, they might then
                            be induced to adopt the<br/>measure. After some farther conversation, it
                            was<br/> agreed to propose going as far as <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogname>, and<br/>

                                <a href="/people/dclin1">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, communicated to

                            his seat, and presented the resolution to the<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_302" n="306"></pb><a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a>, which was seconded by <a href="/people/dclin">De Witt Clinton<persname key="dclin"></persname></a>, and<br/>passed unanimously;
                            it was then immediately sent<br/>to the Assembly, and also passed there
                            without oppo-<br/>sition. These commissioners made several
                            reports,<br/>all which are likely in thy possession; the joint
                            reso-<br/>lution was dated <date when="1810-03-15">15th March,
                                1810</date>. After the war,<br/>it seemed necessary to excite the
                            attention of the<br/> legislature to the prosecution of the <geogname key="eriec">grand canal</geogname>.<br/><a href="/people/jplat1">Judge

                            we conversed<br/>on the subject, and were of opinion, that it
                            would<br/>likely produce a good effect, if a general meeting<br/>of our
                            citizens could be had, and they be induced to<br/>present a memorial to
                            the legislature, stating the<br/>advantages that would result, by
                            connecting the<br/> waters of the Great Western and Northern
                            Lakes<br/>with the Atlantic Ocean. On consulting with <a href="/people/dclin1">DeWitt Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/jswar1">John Swartwout<persname key="jswar1"></persname></a>, it was agreed to<br/>
                            address circular letters to several of our most influ-<br/>ential
                            citizens, requesting them to attend a regular<br/>meeting at the City
                            Hotel. This meeting was large<br/>and respectable, and <a href="/people/jplat1">Judge Platt<persname key="jplat1"></persname></a> introduced the object<br/>for
                            which the meeting was convened, and was fol-<br/>lowed by <a href="/people/dclin1">Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/jswar1">Swartwout<persname key="jswar1"></persname></a>, and others. A com-<br/>mittee consisting of

                            cer-<br/>tainly one of the most able and best drawn papers,<br/>that has
                            been written on the subject, of the advanta-<br/>ges that would result
                            by completing a <geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname> the<br/>whole

                            to thyself, for the county of<br/><a href="/places/ontar1">Ontario<placename key="ontar1"></placename></a>, and also to several others of the

                            signed by many thousands of our citizens<br/>throughout the state; and
                            the prosecution of the<br/><geogname key="eriec">canal</geogname> is
                            certainly owing to the circumstance of <emph rend="italic">this<br/>memorial</emph> being at that time presented to the

                            he was never in our<br/>western country, and certainly never projected a

<salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>The reasons which prevented me from doing more<br/>than merely
                            acknowledging your kind letter of <date when="1820-09">Sep-<br/>tember
                                last</date>, and thanking you for the valuable col-<br/>lection of
                            pamphlets which accompanied it, have<br/>continued ever since I wrote;
                            but being now (as you<br/>will perceive by the enclosure) seriously at
                            work in<br/>the formation of a criminal code for this state, I am<br/>
                            extremely anxious to receive the report of your com-<br/>mittee on the
                            penitentiary system; from which I<br/>have a right to expect so much
                            important informa-<br/>tion, I hope you will not fail to forward a copy
                            to<br/>me as soon as it appears.</p>
<p>I regret very much, that for the reasons I formerly<br/>stated, I could
                            not contribute any thing to the work.</p>
<p>Unless I hear reasons much stronger than any<br/>which have been
                            presented to me, either by reading,<br/>conversation, or reflection, I
                            shall not give the pun-<br/>ishment of death a place in the code which I
                            shall<br/>present; it appears to me to be a most inefficient
                            pun-<br/>ishment, to say nothing of its irremediable nature;<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_304" n="308"></pb> almost all writers on the subject, join in a degree
                            to<br/>acknowledge this, and yet almost all recommend it<br/>for some
                            offences; this I cannot understand, unless it<br/>be the effect of a
                            vindictive sensation against atro-<br/>cious crimes, which ought not to
                            be indulged in legis-<br/>lation.</p>
<p>I am sorry to find, that an opinion of the ineffica-<br/>cy of the
                            penitentiary system is gaining ground, and<br/>should be still more
                            grieved if I thought it well<br/>founded; but I do not, and am inclined
                            to think, that<br/>all the great defects in the system, arise from
                            parsi-<br/>mony in preparing the establishments. If the build-<br/>ings
                            were sufficiently spacious, the prisoners might<br/>be classed, and
                            reformation reasonably expected,<br/>instead of the corruption which
                            indiscriminate con-<br/>finement produces; and injudicious pardons of
                            old<br/>offenders need not be given to make room for
                            new<br/>convicts;—if they were sufficiently solid and strong,<br/>the
                            hope of escape would never be indulged or reali-<br/>zed—but to erect
                            spacious and strong buildings<br/> requires large funds, and it is
                            easier to condemn a<br/>whole system, than to lay taxes to execute it.
                            I<br/>trust, however, that a fair experiment will be made<br/>in
                                <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>; there, if any where, we
                            must look for<br/>enlarged views and useful institutions.</p>
<p>As it is not very probable that I shall ever return<br/>to my native
                            city, my desire to live in the remem-<br/>brance of my friends there has
                            become more import-<br/>ant to me; among them I have always counted
                            you,<br/> and hope you will still allow me to do so.</p>

<salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>On my return to <a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a>, after an
                            absence of several<br/>months, I found your letter, dated <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, <date when="1820-11-03">Novem-<br/>ber 3d, 1820</date>. I am not at present
                            sufficiently<br/>acquainted with the system pursued at the Lunatic
                            <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_305" n="309"></pb>Asylum, at <a href="/places/avers">Aversa<placename key="avers"></placename></a>, to give you the information you<br/>require,

<p>I thank you for the package, and the maps which<br/>points out the route
                            of the canal; it is a most magni-<br/>ficent undertaking, and I trust
                            will answer the ex-<br/>pectations of the promoters of it.</p>
<p>I am extremely sorry, that my absence from<br/>
<a href="/places/naple">Naples<placename key="naple"></placename></a>, deprived me of seeing the
                            young gentlemen<br/>you mention, and of showing them such little
                            atten-<br/>tions as might have been in my power.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p><a href="/people/wburl1">William S. Burling<persname key="wburl1"></persname></a> lately solicited me
                            to recom-<br/>mend to our friend <a href="/people/colv1">Colven<persname key="colv1"></persname></a>, the introduction of a plan<br/>for laying an excise
                            on spirituous liquors, and I part-<br/>ly promised him that I would; but
                            on further reflec-<br/>tion, I consider it most suitable that the
                            overture<br/> should emanate from his constituents, and with
                            this<br/>view I now write to you.</p>
<p>In some well written essays, published on this sub-<br/>ject in Walsh's
                            paper, it was estimated that fifty<br/>millions of gallons of spirituous
                            liquors are annually<br/>consumed in the United States, at an expense
                            of<br/> thirty millions of dollars, and with the sacrifice of<br/>thirty
                            thousand lives. If this be only an approxima-<br/>tion to the truth,
                            what a field for reflection does it<br/>open to the moralist and the
                            statesman.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_306" n="310"></pb>
<p>After deducting foreign importations of spirits, say<br/>to the amount of
                            six millions of gallons, and allow-<br/>ing for four millions produced
                            from foreign molasses,<br/>there would still remain forty millions of
                            gallons<br/>manufactured from our own materials. Does not<br/>this
                            astound us with its enormity, and alarm us with<br/>its terrific
                            aspect!</p>
<p>An excise of one shilling a gallon, would produce<br/>a revenue of five
                            millions of dollars a year. Double<br/>the duty, and you will raise a
                            fund that will pay<br/> off the national debt, and line and intersect
                            the<br/>country in all directions with canals and roads.</p>
<p>Every considerable increase in the price of any<br/>article, tends to
                            check its consumption. And hence,<br/>the revenue of the country would
                            be an auxiliary to<br/>its morality—a noble union in the eye of a
                            great<br/>statesman.</p>

<p>I am particularly obliged by thy kind attention,<br/>in sending me a copy

                            would be<br/> highly useful in this country, it is intended to

                            to<br/>persons of influence in the different states, who are<br/>known

<p>It is expected the prison in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a> will pro-<br/>bably be completed this

<salute>MY WORTHY AND DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
<p>I received your kind letter by <a href="/people/tdwig1">Mr.

                            society. His<br/>appointment to the office you mention, can be
                            made<br/>without a doubt, should the seat of the society
                            be<br/>transferred, as it might, and will be, to <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>.<br/>I will take care of the business at

                            and will<br/>depend on you, my friend, <a href="/people/dmiln1">Doctor

                            heartily engage in the business, to do what-<br/>ever is necessary to be
                            done, in a way of preparation<br/>in <a href="/places/nycit">New
                                York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. I will correspond with you, if agree-<br/>able, on
                            the subject. If <a href="/people/tdwig1">Mr. Dwight<persname key="tdwig1"></persname></a> spends a

                            society<br/>must compensate him.</p>
<p>The first report of the society, which is in the<br/>press, and will be
                            out the last of this week, and one<br/>hundred sent to <a href="/people/tdwig1">Mr. Dwight<persname key="tdwig1"></persname></a> and yourself, will be,
                            I<br/>think, a good introduction to the business of the<br/>removal we
                            contemplated. As we have no funds in<br/>our treasury, we are obliged to
                            tax those who receive<br/>the books, and as I am pledged to pay the
                            printer—<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_308" n="312"></pb>I have paid all the past expenses of the

                            your<br/>direction and influence, with the exertions of
                                Mr.<br/><a href="/people/tdwig1">Dwight<persname key="tdwig1"></persname></a>, who will do the

                            wanted, at the<br/>price mentioned (twenty-five cents,) and to remit
                            me<br/>the amount for the printer. This report will give<br/>information
                            of the nature, objects, and operations of<br/>the society, and should,
                            therefore, be in the hands of<br/>men who have right feelings on the
                            subject—particu-<br/>larly all the members (<emph rend="italic">ex-officio</emph>) of the society—the<br/>clergy of all

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>It is with sincere pleasure that I avail myself of<br/>the present
                            opportunity, to transmit you a copy of<br/>the third and last part of my
                            observations on penal<br/>jurisprudence, which is now ready for
                            publication<br/> here, and in which I have endeavoured, to the
                            best<br/>of my power, to recommend to my countrymen an<br/>improved
                            system of reformatory discipline, similar to<br/>that adopted in the
                            United States of America, and in<br/>the establishment of which you have
                            had so import-<br/>ant a share. I do this with the feelings of a
                            disciple,<br/>who looks up to his master for the approbation of<br/>his
                            labours—there being no person living, whose<br/>ideas on this subject I
                            more implicitly adopt, than<br/>your own. </p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_310" n="314"></pb>
<p> Within these few days, and after my work was<br/>printed and ready for
                            publication, I have received<br/>from <a href="/people/shopk1">Mr.
                                Hopkins<persname key="shopk1"></persname></a>, one of the commissioners appoint-<br/>ed by the
                            legislature last year, to examine and report<br/>on the state of the
                            prisons at <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, their
                            report<br/>on that subject, which has given me more surprise<br/>and
                            concern than I can express, as it appears to me<br/>to recommend an
                            entire abandonment of the reform-<br/>atory system, and the introduction
                            of a plan of<br/>compulsory labour, more severe than any that
                            has<br/>ever yet been proposed. On the receipt of this docu-<br/>ment, I
                            lost no time in drawing up a few remarks<br/>upon it, with the view
                            certainly, but scarcely with<br/>the hope, that if they should arrive
                            before the passing<br/>of the proposed act, they might have some effect
                            in<br/>strengthening the opposition which will, I trust, be<br/>made,
                            for preventing, or at least modifying, the<br/>measures proposed. Of
                            these I send you a few copies,<br/>entreating you to put them into the
                            hands of such of<br/>your friends, as you may think proper; as it is
                            my<br/>decided opinion, that if the system now proposed<br/>should be
                            adopted, the United States of America will<br/>forfeit their chief
                            glory, and will be as remarkable<br/>for the cruelty of their penal
                            code, as they have<br/>hitherto been for their enlightened humanity.</p>
<p>In the hope of hearing from you on this most inte-<br/>resting subject,
                            and of learning that you continue to<br/>enjoy a good state of health, I
                            remain, with the most<br/> sincere attachment and affectionate
                            respect,</p>

                            and the superintendant most remarka-<br/>bly well qualified to conduct
                            such an establishment;<br/>and under his management I think the
                            penitentiary<br/>will succeed, and fully answer the expectations
                            of<br/>those who are friendly to the system of reform. I<br/>sent thee

                            delighted.</p>
<p>Though the state of society of latter years has been<br/>greatly
                            improved, yet daily experience teaches us,<br/>that we are very far from
                            that degree of perfection<br/>on various subjects, we are capable of
                            attaining; the<br/>work goes on slowly, and mostly imperceptibly
                            to<br/>all human observation; we may, however, rest assu-<br/>red, that
                            all principles and practices, no matter how<br/>long they have been
                            continued and supported by<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_312" n="316"></pb>deep rooted prejudices,
                            founded on the blindness and<br/>wickedness of our species, that are
                            clearly contrary<br/>to the laws of God and our own reason, will
                            come<br/>to an end. The slave trade, and the general aboli-<br/>tion of
                            slavery, is a striking proof in support of this<br/> sentiment. It is
                            now almost certain that the trade,<br/>and slavery itself, will not
                            exist many years longer.<br/>Equally against the laws of God and right
                            reason, are<br/>all laws relating to crimes and punishments,
                            enacted<br/> on the principles of a vindictive spirit; such laws
                            are<br/>calculated frequently to violate common justice, and<br/>all
                            distinctions of morality, and, in many cases, tend<br/>to debase the
                            mind, and by the undue severity<br/> they inflict, aim to make fear the
                            motive of obedi-<br/>ence:—in short, these laws are more calculated
                            for<br/>slaves than freemen, and seem intended to
                            punish<br/>delinquents, rather than to prevent crimes. It is true,<br/>a
                            course of improvement has been commenced of<br/>latter years, which
                            claim the approbation of the just<br/>and the sanction of the wise, but
                            no radical reform<br/>can take place, until the public mind is more
                            fully<br/>convinced of the absurdity and wickedness of vindic-<br/>tive
                            punishment. In proportion as this evil governs<br/>our public laws, so
                            the difficulty is increased in form-<br/>ing wholesome laws for the
                            support of prison disci-<br/>pline, calculated for the government and
                            reformation<br/>of convicts. I am exceedingly mortified to find
                            that<br/>my friend <a href="/people/clynd1">Captain Lindes<persname key="clynd1"></persname></a>,
                            keeper of <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a>
                            prison,<br/>advocates (and practices) inflicting corporeal
                            punish-<br/>ment, for violating any part of the prison discipline.<br/>I
                            the more regret that this man should entertain such<br/>sentiments,
                            because, on the general subject of penal<br/>jurisprudence, and the
                            government of a penitentiary,<br/>I esteem him superior to almost any
                            other man that<br/>I ever conversed with:—he formerly was in the
                            army,<br/>and had only had the advantage of a good common<br/>education,
                            but possesses a good share of understand-<br/>ing, great integrity, an
                            amiable disposition, and an<br/> extensive knowledge of human nature, as
                            regards<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_313" n="317"></pb>the middle and lower classes of society. As
                            a discipli-<br/>narian, it would be difficult to find his equal;
                            owing<br/>to his superior management of the convicts, under<br/>his
                            charge. They love and fear him—they regard<br/>him as their friend and
                            protector—he furnishes them<br/>with plenty of good wholesome
                            provisions—keeps<br/>them constantly employed, but never imposes
                            immo-<br/>derate tasks on them—he holds no conversation with<br/>them
                            except in directing their work, and this course<br/>is strictly pursued
                            by all his subordinate keepers—<br/>he disdains the idle notion, that
                            extreme severity is<br/>the only appropriate mode for the government of
                            a<br/>penitentiary. I never conversed with a person,<br/>whose
                            sentiments as respects the management of<br/>convicts, so cordially met
                            my views, and in my opi-<br/>nion are so well calculated to promote
                            their general<br/>welfare, and produce reformation. It is my
                            opinion,<br/>that there is no prison in the world equal to
                            Auburn<br/>prison, as regards cleanliness, industry, and good<br/>
                            conduct. The rules and regulations of the prison<br/>are made known to
                            each convict, and the moment<br/>any of them are violated, the offender
                            is punished—<br/>it is owing to the certainty of this, that it is
                            very<br/>rare any punishment is inflicted. I perfectly agree<br/>with
                            him in every particular he advances, except as<br/>to the mode of
                            punishment adopted by him. I have<br/> in vain urged to him, that
                            whipping is totally incon-<br/>sistent with the principles of that mild
                            system we<br/>wish to establish. I cannot persuade him, that
                            prompt<br/>punishment, by confinement, in a solitary cell on<br/>bread
                            and water, will produce the same effects as<br/>whipping. I allow he
                            will not exercise this power<br/>unless accompanied with a degree of
                            justice, as to<br/>the nature of the offence committed, but
                            certainly<br/>others may abuse it, and therefore it never ought
                            to<br/>be allowed in any prison. I have told him that<br/>during several
                            years, that the <a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> state
                            prison<br/>was subject to my direction as one of its
                            inspectors,<br/>there never was a single instance of inflicting
                            corpo-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_314" n="318"></pb>real punishment, and yet perfect order was
                            complete-<br/>ly preserved. He, however, persists in his
                            notion,<br/>that it is impossible to preserve order without
                            whip-<br/>ping. I am firm in the belief, that <a href="/people/clynd1">Captain Lindes<persname key="clynd1"></persname></a><br/>will, in time, alter his opinions. He
                            is a complete<br/>enthusiast in favour of the penitentiary system,
                            and<br/>has those peculiar qualifications, that will enable<br/>him to
                            carry it to a degree of perfection that it has<br/>never yet attained.
                            The quietness of the prisoners<br/>subject to his care and management is
                            much to be<br/>admired. Some months ago, in company with our<br/>mutual
                            friend, <a href="/people/jgris1">Professor Griscom<persname key="jgris1"></persname></a>, I visited
                                <a href="/places/sings">Sing Sing<placename key="sings"></placename></a>,<br/>situated on the
                                <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogname>, about thirty miles
                                from<br/><a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>. At this place
                            is erecting a state prison,<br/>within a hundred yards of the margin of
                            the river—<br/>the banks are about one hundred feet high, and
                            con-<br/>tain large and extensive marble quarries, of
                            excellent<br/>quality, which is excavated, and hammered, and<br/>formed
                            for the building, which will contain eight<br/>hundred cells;—the state
                            has purchased about one<br/>hundred and fifty acres of fine land
                            adjoining the<br/>building—the erecting the prison is committed
                            solely<br/>to the care and management of <a href="/people/clynd1">Captain
                                Lindes<persname key="clynd1"></persname></a>—the<br/>plan is his own, and, in my opinion, the
                            best in the<br/>world. The flooring, ceiling, and sides of each
                            cell,<br/>are entirely of marble, and the doors iron. He has<br/>with
                            him one hundred and thirty convicts, which he<br/>brought from
                                <a href="/places/aubur">Auburn<placename key="aubur"></placename></a> prison—besides these, he
                            has<br/>one master carpenter, one mason, and one black-<br/>smith—<emph rend="italic">no other persons except convicts are
                            employed</emph>;—<br/>he commenced last spring, and next year the
                            work<br/> will probably be completed. There is no wood used<br/>in
                            building this prison—it is all of stone. Convicts<br/>are employed in
                            quarrying, burning lime, (from mar-<br/>ble,) forming the stone, mason
                            work, and making<br/>iron doors for the cells, &amp;c. The whole cost of
                            the<br/>building will not exceed $75,000, about £16,500 ster-<br/>ling.
                            The decent order and conduct of the convicts<br/>is wonderful; they are
                            allowed plenty of beef and<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_315" n="319"></pb>pork, and excellent bread,
                            but no other drink than<br/>good water; those employed as smiths never
                            work-<br/>ed at the trade till they came to <a href="/places/sing">Sing
                                Sing<placename key="sing"></placename></a>, and the<br/>neatness and excellence of their work
                            in making the<br/>doors and locks for the cells, are really
                            astonishing.<br/>The mason work appears to be done in the best
                            man-<br/>ner—the men all have a chain about fifteen pounds.<br/>Their
                            first work was to erect sheds with pine boards,<br/>to lodge in at
                            night; they are not allowed to speak<br/>to each other, of course, the
                            whole work is quietly<br/>conducted, without the least noise or
                            confusion; they<br/>have enjoyed remarkable good health, and though<br/>
                            the summer was uncommonly hot, and they had to<br/>work exposed to the
                            sun, yet, I think, only two have<br/>been sick; they never missed
                            working every day, and<br/>but one has escaped. Six men, each with a
                            musket,<br/>are stationed at equal distances from each
                            other—the<br/>river in the front, serves also to prevent an
                            escape.<br/>When the prison is finished, all the convicts in
                                the<br/><a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> state prison in
                            this city, about five to six<br/>hundred, are to be removed, and it is
                            intended to<br/>employ them in making lime, and preparing marble<br/>in
                            various ways to be transported to the city, to be<br/>used for purposes
                            of ornament, building, &amp;c. The<br/>work is admirably calculated to
                            promote good health,<br/> and so simple, that every man can be employed;
                            all<br/>the marble they can send to this city, and to <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>,<br/>and other places on the
                                <geogname key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogname>, will meet<br/>with an
                            immediate sale, and considerable will be<br/>exported to the Southern
                            states. Order, and conse-<br/>quently the important work of reformation,
                            will be<br/>far more certain, than if various trades were
                            pursued.<br/>And here, permit me to observe, that I think
                            thy<br/>remark, that each convict should learn some trade,<br/>does not
                            apply to this country so much as it may to<br/>
<a href="/places/engl">England<placename key="engl"></placename></a>. Some of our convicts have
                            been brought<br/>up to trades, but most of them have been
                            employed<br/>at farming and as labourers. If they are willing
                            to<br/>work, they may readily get employment in the city<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_316" n="320"></pb>as labourers, or in the country as farmers. I agree<br/>with thee in
                            most of the sentiments contained in thy<br/>private remarks, and have
                            handed a copy to the lead-<br/>ing members of our legislature, who, I
                            know, are<br/>heartily disposed to improve our penal code,
                            and<br/>establish the mildest penitentiary system. I have<br/>the
                            fullest confidence, that the most objectionable<br/>parts of the
                            commissioners report will not be adopt-<br/>ed; and, in time, I am
                            satisfied, that confinement in<br/>cells, on bread and water, for breach
                            of prison disci-<br/>pline, will be practised instead of corporeal
                            punish-<br/>ment. The public feeling, and the principles of com-<br/>mon
                            sense, will prevail, and do away the deep rooted<br/>prejudices of our
                            public legislation—the work is slow,<br/>but sure. My friend <a href="/people/shopk1">Hopkins<persname key="shopk1"></persname></a>, whose character is<br/>known to
                            thee, is a good man, but the report of the<br/> commissioners serves to
                            prove, that he has some very<br/>incorrect notions respecting the
                            penitentiary system;<br/>however, I believe his mind is now got to be
                            more<br/>enlightened on the subject. My particular and inti-<br/>mate
                            friend, <a href="/people/ccold1">Cadwallader D. Colden<persname key="ccold1"></persname></a>, an
                            eminent<br/>lawyer, and formerly mayor of this city, and now
                            a<br/>member of the <a href="/organizations/nysen">Senate<orgname key="nysen"></orgname></a> of this state,
                            has been closely<br/>united with me for many years, in endeavours
                            for<br/>the improvement of our penal laws and penitentiary<br/>system.
                            He has been uniformly most decided in his<br/>sentiments in favour of
                            the great object we have in<br/>view; and I have full confidence in his
                            judgment,<br/>zeal, and attention to any legislative business,
                            that<br/>may be introduced in the course of the present

                            accommo-<br/>date six hundred convicts, will be finished next
                            year,<br/>and will cost five times as much as ours at <a href="/places/sings">Sing Sing<placename key="sings"></placename></a>,<br/>which will have eight hundred
                            cells. Their plan is,<br/>that a convict sentenced for three, four, or
                            five years,<br/>shall, during the whole period of his sentence, be
                            con-<br/>fined in his cell, at some kind of work; this, they
                            say,<br/>will produce complete reformation, and they are so
                            fixed<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_317" n="321"></pb>in their opinions of the superior efficacy of
                            this plan,<br/>that it is in vain to urge to them that it is cruel
                            and<br/>impolitic. The projectors of this plan, are my par-<br/>ticular
                            friends, of the first rank and respectability in<br/>the city of
                                <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. I have no doubt but
                            the<br/>experience of one year will convince them of
                            their<br/>error.</p>
<p>I cannot be reconciled to think myself deserving<br/>thy very handsome
                            compliment, in attributing to me<br/>having an important share in the
                            establishment of<br/>the reformatory system in this country; the
                            chief<br/>credit is due that truly wise and good man, <a href="/people/wpenn1">WilliamPenn,<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> whose example and hints
                            relating to this<br/>great subject, was acted on and improved by a
                            num-<br/>ber of my valuable friends in <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, soon after<br/><a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> was declared an independent state.</p>
<p>I have been very much gratified with thy commu-<br/>nications, and most
                            particularly by the several pub-<br/>lications on the subject of penal
                            jurisprudence, and<br/>I do beg, thou wilt be so kind as to favour me,
                            occa-<br/>sionally, with some account of the progress made in<br/>the
                            reformatory system in England, and if any thing<br/>is doing relating to
                            it, on the continent.</p>

<salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
<p>I have received your letter of the <date when="1825-12-27">27th</date>.
                            Every time<br/>I visit <a href="/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>, I am
                            fully convinced that the conti-<br/>guity of our settlements is
                            destructive to the frac-<br/>tional or remnant population of the red
                            men, and<br/>that therefore their only salvation lies in removal
                            to<br/>a distance. I have, however, never authorized
                            any<br/>communication through <a href="/people/jparr2">Captain
                                Parrish<persname key="jparr2"></persname></a>, or any other<br/>agent, on that point. My rule
                            has been to leave them<br/>to their own volitions.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_318" n="322"></pb>
<p>All travellers agree, that in the ratio of their dis-<br/>tance from the
                            white, in that ratio is the prevalence of<br/> the good qualities of the
                            red men. All experience con-<br/>firms this remark; they acquire our
                            vices without<br/>any of our virtues; and they melt away on our
                            ap-<br/>proach, like snow at the mouth of a furnace. My<br/>kind regards
                            to your family.</p>

<p>When <a href="/people/dhosa1">Doctor Hosack<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a> contemplated writing the
                    life<br/> of his friend, <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, he
                    addressed a note to<br/><a href="/people/wrosc1">Mr. Roscoe<persname key="wrosc1"></persname></a>, requesting
                    him to furnish any informa-<br/>tion he might have in regard to the
                    philanthropic<br/> labours of the Howard of America—to which the<br/><a href="/people/dhosa1">Doctor<persname key="dhosa1"></persname></a> received the subjoined reply. It was
                    dictated<br/>by the accomplished author of the LIVES of the<br/>Medici, and of
                    the Sovereign Pontiff, Leo X., when<br/>the writer could no longer bear the
                    fatigue of writing<br/>a single page with his own hand. It came from a<br/>mind
                    about to depart to a better world, but which<br/>then reflected the images of
                    virtue, sentiment, and<br/>affection, as purely as it did in the prime of his
                    exist-<br/>ence. In the soul of <a href="/people/wrosc1">Roscoe<persname key="wrosc1"></persname></a> there
                    was no sediment;<br/>the last rays of the lamp of life were redolent of
                    taste<br/>and poesy. There was no envy, no aversion, no<br/>repinings breathed
                    from his lips, and his criticisms<br/>have the weight of truth and sincerity,
                    which can<br/>only flow from a pure and exalted spirit. Praise<br/>from such a
                    man, under such circumstances, can<br/>never be forgotten. I could not contract
                    this letter.<br/>I had no right to do it.</p>
<floatingtext type="letter">
<opener>MY DEAR SIR,</opener>
<p>Some time previous to the receipt of the letter<br/>with which you
                            honoured me, dated the <date when="1829-04-29">29th
                                April,<br/>1829,</date> and accompanying the present of your
                            valua-<br/>ble memoir of <a href="/people/dclin1">Governor
                                Clinton<persname key="dclin1"></persname></a>, I had an attack of<br/>paralysis, which had
                            interfered with my usual occu-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_319" n="323"></pb>pations, and for some
                            time interrupted my correspon-<br/>dence ; and, although by the blessing
                            of God, and by<br/>the aid of repeated depletion, and powerful
                            reme-<br/>dies, I have been restored to such a state of health as<br/>to
                            be able to devote a prescribed portion of my time<br/>to the society of
                            my friends and the perusal of my<br/>books, a result at my time of life
                            (approaching my<br/>78th year) scarcely to be expected ; yet it has not
                            been<br/>till of late that I have been able to undertake the<br/>perusal
                            of so large a work as yours, which I have<br/>now read, not only without
                            any injurious conse-<br/>quences to my health, but with great
                            information<br/>and amusement. At the same, time I have imbibed<br/>a
                            very distinct idea and favourable opinion of the<br/>truly great and
                            good man, whose character you have<br/>so admirably depicted, and whose
                            great and various<br/>merits you have so ably illustrated and
                            explained.<br/>Writing, as I now do, under the immediate
                            impres-<br/>sions derived from the perusal of your noble tribute<br/>to
                            the memory of your friend, it would be unjust in<br/>me to suppress the
                            feelings with which I have been<br/>actuated, or to deny that, highly as
                            I estimate such a<br/> character in a nation abounding in great men, I
                            con-<br/>sider your production as having shown you worthy<br/>to have
                            been his biographer, and whilst you have<br/>raised an imperishable
                            monument to his fame, to<br/>have given the surest earnest of your own.
                            In addi-<br/>tion to the regret I feel, in not having been able
                            to<br/>reply sooner to your letter, 1 am sorry not to
                            have<br/>transmitted you the few documents requested by
                            you,<br/>respecting my late highly esteemed friend, <a href="/people/teddy1">ThomasEddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, of whom I have read several
                            very interesting<br/>memorials in your work; but the same calamity
                            that<br/> prevented me from writing, also prevented me
                            from<br/>performing this duty, having taken me when my<br/>papers were
                            in such a state of derangement that they<br/>could not, for a long time,
                            be looked into. I am, how-<br/>ever, in some degree, consoled by the
                            consideration,<br/>that you will not have been delayed in your
                            intend-<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_320" n="324"></pb>ed account of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, by my apparent negligence;<br/>my correspondence
                            with him being only occasional,<br/> and extending to little more than
                            the interchange of<br/>new publications, although I always entertained
                            a<br/>very high opinion both of his benevolence and his<br/>literary
                            talents. As the indisposition to which I<br/> have referred, attacked me
                            at a lime when I was en-<br/>gaged in a debate with some of your
                            countrymen,<br/>on the subject of prison discipline, my medical
                            friends<br/>advised me, for a time, not to enter again upon that<br/>
                            subject, and it is only of late that I have been able to<br/>have the
                            satisfaction of hearing of the system of dis-<br/>cipline recently
                            established at <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>;
                            whence,<br/>for many years, I have been led to expect the adop-<br/>tion
                            of the horrid punishment of solitary confinement,<br/> without
                            permitting the convicts to labour; with<br/>which view, the legislature
                            has erected two large and<br/>expensive prisons, intending to confine
                            the criminals<br/>in such a manner that they should be separated,
                            not<br/>only by night but by day, and should be deprived of<br/>the
                            liberty of working, lest it should be an allevia-<br/>tion of their
                            suffering. Against this inhuman and<br/>unchristian-like system, my
                            humble voice has been<br/> raised, amongst those of many others of more
                            impor-<br/>tance, for several years past; but it is only a few<br/>weeks
                            since that I have learnt, by a communication<br/>of authentic documents
                            from <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, that the<br/>
                            legislature have at length given way to the feelings<br/>of humanity,
                            and have determined that the convicts<br/>shall be allowed to labour in
                            the day, and shall be<br/>instructed for that purpose, as well as in
                            whatever<br/>else may be requisite for their reformation.
                            The<br/>commissioners, whom the legislature had appointed<br/>to
                            consider and report to them on this subject, had,<br/>indeed,
                            recommended to them, in their report, that<br/>the convicts should be
                            permitted to labour in compa-<br/>nies, under proper restriction; but
                            with this the legis-<br/>lature would not comply, which I cannot but
                            greatly<br/>regret; although I cannot but rejoice, at the same<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_321" n="325"></pb>time, that so much has been accomplished; consider-<br/>ing
                            the object of labour, or no labour, as being, in fact,<br/>the only
                            question in debate, and being of opinion,<br/>for various reasons, that
                            the legislature will be<br/>obliged to resort to the plan recommended by
                            their<br/> commissioners. By this decision, I conceive the
                            great<br/>question of prison discipline, as far as regards
                            the<br/>United States, is finally settled; every other place,<br/>except
                                <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, already adopted
                            that plan, there-<br/>by making crime to counteract itself, and repair,
                            as<br/>far as possible, the evils it has occasioned. In no<br/>country
                            has this principle been so well understood,<br/>or carried so far, as in
                            your own, and the relinquish-<br/>ment of it for the Bastile system of
                            solitary confine-<br/>ment, would have grieved me more than I can
                            express;<br/>but, thank God, my dread of that is over; and I
                            shall<br/>now die in peace, convinced that the time will arrive<br/>when
                            my own country will follow the example.</p>
<p>You will not be surprised to hear that our canal<br/>navigations, which
                            have hitherto been very produc-<br/>tive, are depreciated by the
                            completion of our rail-<br/>way from <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/manch">Manchester<placename key="manch"></placename></a>; which is shortly<br/>expected to be
                            succeeded by one from <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>
                                to<br/><a href="/places/lond">London<placename key="lond"></placename></a>, and by several
                            others in different parts of<br/>the kingdom; but our small dykes bear
                            no propor-<br/>tion to your magnificent aqueducts, which, I
                            suppose,<br/>set all competition from railways at defiance.</p>
<p>I send you an account of the <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a>
                            and <a href="/places/manch">Man-chester<placename key="manch"></placename></a> road, as just

                            on opening the <a href="/places/liver">Liverpool<placename key="liver"></placename></a><br/>Institution, and of a work I published some

<p> On the <date when="1817-12-23">23d December, 1817</date>, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> lost his son,<br/>
<a href="/people/jeddy1">John Hartshorne Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>. He died in the 34th year
                    of<br/>his age. He was a remarkable young man. At the<br/>age of twelve years,
                    he lost his hearing from the<br/>scarlet fever; he had then only the common
                    and<br/>ordinary instruction of a boy of that age. On his<br/>recovery, he
                    discovered an ardent desire for know-<br/>ledge, and commenced with zeal the
                    process of self-<br/>instruction, and that so successfully, that, at
                    eighteen,<br/>he was far advanced in polite literature, having ac-<br/>quired a
                    good knowledge of the Latin and French<br/>languages. He was accomplished in
                    drawing, botany<br/>painting, and poetry; and, at the same time,
                    pursued,<br/>with assiduity his mathematical studies. We have<br/>known more
                    than one instance, in which the misfor-<br/>tune of deafness has given new
                    acuteness and energy<br/>to the mind. The restlessness that generally
                    attends<br/>this misfortune, drives the mind to examine its own<br/>resources,
                    and to weigh its own powers; and it is<br/>astonishing how much can be done,
                    when we are<br/>obliged to do it, either by motives of
                    advancement,<br/>ambition, or necessity; and no necessity is stronger<br/>than
                    that of preventing the mind from preying upon<br/>itself. The paintings of young
                        <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a> showed taste<br/>and skill, but
                    he did not choose to follow the art as<br/>a profession; it had too much to do
                    with others to<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_323" n="327"></pb>satisfy him. He painted only for amusement.
                    He<br/> loved poetry in early life, for it gave him an oppor-<br/>tunity of
                    pouring out his feelings without disguise;<br/>but he found, at a later period,
                    how much excitement<br/> it costs to make images from nature and truth,
                    to<br/>bathe them in the purest blood of the heart, and<br/>then to send them
                    out to a cold, critical world. At<br/>length, he, in a good measure, gave up his
                    muse, and<br/>devoted his time to the sciences. In the pursuit
                    of<br/>mathematics, geometry, astronomy, and topography,<br/>there are no throes
                    or agonies, and but few difficulties<br/>of any kind in the pathway. To these
                    studies he<br/>gave almost undivided attention. In this almost<br/>pure
                    abstraction, the memory is not busy, and the<br/>heart is still. He pursued his
                    scientific course several<br/>years; and, for exercise and amusement, he
                    made<br/>topographical surveys in every part of the state of<br/><a href="/places/newyo">New York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>, and drew several maps. His large
                    map<br/>of the state, the best that had ever been drawn of it,<br/>was published
                    the year after his death, but it was in<br/>the hands of the engraver before his
                    decease. In his<br/> tour of topographical surveying, he improved
                    his<br/>knowledge of botany, for there was nothing painful<br/>in this science;
                    for, while the flower and herb give<br/>delight to the senses, they are subjects
                    of soothing<br/>contemplation to the mind. The wonders of nature<br/>are as
                    fully developed in the bumble violet or daisy,<br/>as by the whole forest, and,
                    to the mind of the phi-<br/>losopher, as distinctly prove the existence of a
                    God,<br/>as the astounding cataract or terrific volcano. <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr.Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a> was ready, with his pen, to perform any
                    ser-<br/>vice to science or the arts. Dr. <a href="/people/jfran1">John W.
                        Francis<persname key="jfran1"></persname></a>, to<br/>whose literary taste and talents we are often
                    much<br/>indebted, in a memoir of his friend, written soon<br/>after his
                    decease, says,—</p>
<floatingtext type="narrative">
<p><a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a> was the author<br/>of a number
                            of essays which appeared in the news-<br/>papers, on botany and other
                            branches of natural<br/>history; on geography, and the internal
                            improvement<br/>of this state. An essay on geography, which he<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_324" n="328"></pb>intended for publication in this magazine, will
                            pro-<br/>bably shortly appear. He was a member of the <orgname key="nyhis"><a href="/places/newyo">NewYork<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>

                            was elected to <br/>a similar honour in the Literary and

                            York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a>. To this latter association he<br/>communicated an
                            interesting memoir on the geogra-<br/>phy of <a href="/places/afri">Africa<placename key="afri"></placename></a>. That unfortunate mariner, <a href="/people/jrile1">CaptainJames Riley<persname key="jrile1"></persname></a>, the narrative of
                            whose sufferings has<br/>awakened so large a portion of public
                            attention, had<br/>applied to <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>
                            to draw for him a map of part<br/>of <a href="/places/afri">Africa<placename key="afri"></placename></a>. This gave <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a> the occasion of<br/> examining the different
                            accounts that had been pub-<br/>lished by different- travellers, on
                            African geography;<br/>and, without passing sentence of condemnation
                            on<br/>any writer for wilful misrepresentations, he gives<br/>due credit
                            to the statement of <a href="/people/jrile1">Captain Riley<persname key="jrile1"></persname></a>.
                                <a href="/people/jrile1">CaptainRiley<persname key="jrile1"></persname></a> has, indeed,
                            been pronounced a loose writer by<br/>an anonymous reviewer; but the
                            testimonies to his<br/>worth and veracity are most respectable, and,
                            be-<br/>sides, he is subject to the evidence of living witnesses.<br/>It
                            cannot be denied, that his work contains most<br/>important views of
                            interior <a href="/places/afri">Africa<placename key="afri"></placename></a>; and it is
                            grati-<br/>fying to observe, that a gentleman possessed of
                            the<br/>talents and learning of <a href="/people/hmurr1">Hugh
                                Murray<persname key="hmurr1"></persname></a>, Esq., should,<br/>in his enlarged edition of
                            Leyden's Historical Account<br/>of Discoveries and Travels in Africa,
                            pay the tribute<br/>of high regard to our American narrator.</p>
<p>Enough has been said to show, that the strongest<br/>principle of action
                            in <a href="/people/jeddy1">John H. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>, was the
                            laud-<br/>able desire to be useful; that he was superior to<br/>making a
                            trade of liberal pursuits, and generous in<br/>pecuniary matters, is
                            admitted by those to whom he<br/>was best known. To conclude this hasty
                            sketch, it<br/>is unfortunately too frequently our lot, to lament
                            the<br/> seemingly untimely departure of aspiring genius and<br/>worth;
                            but it may confidently be said, seldom could<br/>our regret and
                            lamentation be more feelingly be-<br/>stowed, than on the subject of
                            this brief memorial.<br/>Time and talents have rarely been more
                            constantly<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_325" n="329"></pb>or more undeviatingly directed to
                            objects of substan-<br/>tial importance; and it is painful to reflect,
                            that his<br/>fatal illness was prematurely induced, in
                            consequence<br/>of such exertions. Let the qualities of his heart
                            and<br/>his moral excellence command our regard; for the<br/>services he
                            has rendered, let the debt of gratitude be<br/>paid to his memory.

<p>We have remarked, that <a href="/places/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<placename key="jeddy1"></placename></a> gave up

                    botany. He had been<br/>taught this science by <a href="/people/dhosa1">Doctor

<floatingtext type="undetermined">
<p>So long ago as the year <date when="1814">1814</date>, the following
                            queries<br/>were prepared by the late <a href="/people/jeddy1">John H.

                            of a circular, and a<br/>number of copies were sent to various gentlemen
                            in<br/> different parts of the country to which they relate.<br/>Few
                            communications, however, were received in<br/>reply; and the multiplied
                            avocations of <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a><br/>compelled
                            him to postpone the prosecution of his<br/>inquiries to a period of
                            greater leisure. But an<br/>untimely death, arresting him in the midst
                            of his<br/>labours, has torn him from science and his country,<br/>and
                            left the task to other hands. With the view of<br/>reviving inquiry upon
                            this subject, we publish the<br/>circular drawn up by <a href="/people/jeddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="jeddy1"></persname></a>, and solicit the atten-<br/>tion of
                            the scientific to the topics therein suggested.<br/>Any communications,

                                    the<br/>queries, I will add some conjectures of my own,
                                    drawn<br/>from the very limited means of information I at
                                    pre-<br/>sent possess.</p>
<p>It is well known that there are, at the <a href="/places/lfall">Little Falls<placename key="lfall"></placename></a><br/>of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogname>, evident marks of the
                                    rocks<br/>having been formerly washed by the waves, or by
                                    a<br/>current of water one hundred feet above the
                                    present<br/>surface at the head of the falls. Now it appears,
                                    by<br/>the levels taken by the surveyors employed by
                                    the<br/>commissioners of the Grand Canal, that the
                                    surface<br/>of the water at that place, is less than sixty
                                    feet<br/>lower than at <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>,
                                    therefore it seems to me there<br/>can be no doubt, that when
                                    the waters washed the<br/>top of the hill at the falls, the
                                    country above, along<br/>the valley of the river, as far as (and
                                    much, farther<br/>than) <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>,
                                    must once have been the bottom of a<br/>large lake, bounded on
                                    each side, at no great distance,<br/>by the uplands, and
                                    presenting, in shape, a long nar-<br/>row arm, similar to the
                                    present lakes of <geogname key="cayug">Cayuga</geogname> and<br/>
<geogname key="senec">Seneca</geogname>; and as there is a
                                    gradual descent in the<br/>country west of <a href="/places/rome">Rome<placename key="rome"></placename></a>, as far as <a href="/places/three">Three-River Point<placename key="three"></placename></a>,<br/>and the elevation from
                                    that point to the falls of the<br/><geogname key="sener">Seneca
                                        river</geogname> near <a href="/places/scawy">Scawyace<placename key="scawy"></placename></a>, is very inconsiderable,<br/>it seems
                                    to me equally undoubted, that the waters<br/>once reached so
                                    far, including the present <geogname key="cayug">Cayuga</geogname>,<br/><geogname key="cross">Cross</geogname>, <geogname key="ononl">Onondaga</geogname>, and <geogname key="oneil">Oneida
                                        lakes</geogname>, the last of which <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_330" n="334"></pb>I
                                    imagine was near the centre. I suppose this great<br/>lake to
                                    have been bounded on the east by the hill at<br/>the falls; on
                                    the south by the uplands, giving rise to<br/>the head waters of
                                    the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehannah</geogname>; on the
                                    north<br/>by the elevation of the great step from the
                                    lower<br/>falls on <geogname key="genes2">Gennesee</geogname> to
                                        <geogname key="oswef">Oswego Falls</geogname>; and on the
                                    east,<br/>by the uplands between the head waters of <geogname key="mudcr">Mud<br/>Creek</geogname> and <geogname key="genes2">Genesee River</geogname>. Its extent up the
                                    valley<br/>of <geogname key="mudcr">Mud Creek</geogname> I don't
                                    pretend to conjecture, but sup-<br/>pose its length from east to
                                    west may have been<br/>about a hundred and twenty miles, and its
                                    breadth<br/>in general about twenty. All the country
                                    within<br/>these limits is a flat, surrounded by much
                                    higher<br/>land, and its soil, and likewise its small and
                                    almost<br/>imperceptible horizontal inclination is, I
                                    believe,<br/>precisely similar to the muddy bottoms of the
                                    lakes<br/>I have mentioned. But the circumstance which<br/>seems
                                    to me most strongly to corroborate my opinion,<br/>is the known
                                    decrease in the waters of these lakes,<br/>and, of course,
                                    diminution in their extent, and the<br/>time probably is
                                    approaching when they will be<br/> entirely drained, and when
                                    the land left by the<br/>water is covered with timber, (which
                                    would soon be<br/>the case if left to nature,) it will present a
                                    country<br/>similar in appearance to that on the south side
                                        of<br/><geogname key="oneil">Oneida Lake</geogname>, the

                                    with creeks<br/>meandering through it like the <geogname key="sener">Seneca River</geogname>, <geogname key="onecr">Oneida</geogname>,<br/><geogname key="cowas">Cowaselon</geogname>, and <geogname key="woodc">Wood

<p>The mind that could pass from the inspirations of<br/>the Muse to such
                            deep questions of philosophy, was<br/>one of no ordinary range; and, by
                            the very point of<br/>the questions, as well as from his own
                            suggestions,<br/>we conceive a high idea of his powers, and feel

                            should have died so young; for much might<br/> have been expected from a
                            scholar in the prime of<br/>life, pursuing such a course. There are but
                            few in<br/>this country, who had, at the same time, leisure,
                            in-<br/>clination, and talents, to make such philosophical<br/>
                            examinations.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>The early education of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was, as the
                    fact<br/>is given by himself, miscellaneous and scanty. The<br/>most approved
                    schools in his youthful days were very<br/>indifferent, compared with those of
                    modern times,<br/>and but little more than the first elements of educa-<br/>tion
                    could be had in them. He was in a good mea-<br/>sure self-taught, and by
                    observing a right course, he<br/>was constantly at school, while in the course
                    of his<br/>business, and gained a knowledge of the world as he<br/>proceeded in
                    the duties of life. Such knowledge, if<br/>not at first entirely correct, has a
                    self correcting prin-<br/>ciple in it, which is experience.</p>
<p>His mind was so well disciplined, that every thing<br/>he gained he kept; and in
                    gathering up his treasures<br/>of knowledge, he always calculated on ulterior
                    views,<br/>which were not then, even to his own mind, fully<br/> developed. He
                    was ambitious of attainment, but<br/>never suffered his vanity to interfere with
                    the means<br/>of gaining knowledge, for he was at great pains in<br/> getting
                    the opinion of the wise and good on every<br/>subject; but he never followed the
                    opinions of any<br/>man, until he had studied the subject thoroughly,<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_334" n="338"></pb>and weighed every opinion offered. He compared<br/>all, and, as an
                    optimist, selected for himself. He<br/>never seemed startled at any theory,
                    however singular,<br/>but took the pains to examine it calmly, and if
                    bound<br/>to refute it, did it mildly, but distinctly. In all his<br/>exertions,
                    he always measured the means in regard to<br/>the ends, and was seldom deceived
                    in his calculations;<br/>yet, at times, he was considered as a bold
                    financier,<br/>full of expedients; but the results always justified
                    his<br/>calculations, and there can be no doubt, but that the<br/>opinions which
                    he offered on various subjects to the<br/>corporations to which he belonged,
                    which were not<br/>adopted in the early part of his course, but which<br/>
                    proved in the end to be the correct ones, gave him a<br/>greater influence
                    afterwards, than if they had pre-<br/>vailed at the time they were given.</p>
<p>His mind was quick, shrewd, and logical. He<br/>caught a suggestion with great
                    readiness, but was<br/>slow in making up his judgment. He looked on
                    all<br/>sides of a question with immense care, for he was<br/>early taught
                    precaution, the first ingredient in good<br/> sense. His combinations,
                    comparisons, parallels, in-<br/>ferences, and arguments, were all familiar to
                    him<br/>before his opinions were promulgated, but when his<br/> judgments were
                    formed, they were not readily given<br/>up, upon any authority. If, in coming to
                    a conclu-<br/>sion, he was slow and wary, in action he was rapid<br/>and
                    indefatigable.</p>
<p>He never wrote until he had arranged his thoughts,<br/>and chosen his language to
                    clothe them; of course,<br/>there is a neatness and fine connexion in his
                    writ-<br/>ing, which, if they do not exalt his style to classical<br/>beauty,
                    make it a much better business vehicle.<br/>There are no extraordinary thoughts,
                    no wonderfully<br/>brilliant sentences, in his productions, that could
                    be<br/>quoted to show his strength of wing or boldness of<br/>flight, but in
                    every work of his there are exhibited<br/>strong leatures, and as a whole, the
                    production is<br/>always effective. A forcible thinker, with only a<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_335" n="339"></pb>fair vocabulary, makes a clear and impressive writer.<br/><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> uses good words in their proper places,
                    and<br/>that always makes a good style for any subject-mat-<br/>ter. His logic
                    has much of the Aristotelian clearness<br/>about it; but being exercised upon
                    the practical affairs<br/>of life, instead of ingenious theories, it is not
                    so<br/>apparent.</p>
<p> His time was all his own, for he had no days of<br/>gloom or hypochondriacism to
                    weaken the energies<br/>of his mind, through the pulses of his heart.
                    He<br/>indulged in no morbid views of life, nor suffered<br/>from over strained
                    feelings at human misery, but he<br/>knew all the evils that existed, and had
                    nerve enough<br/>to combat them. He depended for fame on no one<br/>brilliant
                    deed, or no one fortunate occurrence, but on<br/>a life of active benevolence. A
                    command over his<br/>passions, is the first lesson that he who intends
                    to<br/>live for mankind, should learn. It is in this cool sere-<br/>nity that
                    the mind gains its greatest strength and<br/>aptitude for action. When obtained,
                    it gives to youth<br/>the habits and facilities that belong to riper
                    years.<br/>This complacency increases every day by reflection,<br/>and keeps the
                    mind from decrepitude and decay in<br/>more advanced years. In such a state, a
                    man, like<br/>the mariner sailing before the refreshing trade winds,<br/>can
                    calculate almost to a certainty what may be accom-<br/>plished in a given time.
                    When the imagination is<br/>under proper control, and man is guided by
                    expe-<br/>rience, he can correct yesterday's error, if one was<br/>made, by
                    to-day's reasoning. In such a life, where<br/>every thing is accurately measured
                    and surveyed, the<br/>world passes onward, not like the uncertain
                    shadow<br/>upon the dial of life, flitting with every cloud, but<br/>like the
                    heavenly bodies,<br/><quote>Wheeling unshaken through the void
                    immense.</quote></p>
<p>The religious order to which <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was
                    attached<br/>by birth and principle, have ever since their rise<br/>been
                    remarkable for self-discipline. This character-<br/>istic gave <a href="/people/wpenn1">Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a>, and his successors, their influence <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_336" n="340"></pb>over the Indians, which preserved peace for so many<br/>years in
                    their borders. Such men suffer in turbu-<br/>lent times for not taking part in
                    the bustle, but are<br/>amply repaid for this, in their prosperity in days
                    of<br/>quiet. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was a firm orthodox
                    Friend, whose<br/>faith was unshaken in the midst of difficulties.</p>
<p>The recent separation which has taken place in<br/>the Society of Friends, is a
                    matter of public notoriety,<br/>and it is also pretty generally known, that a
                    differ-<br/>ence of opinion, upon some of the leading doctrines,<br/>was the
                    cause of this unhappy division. Although<br/>this separation did not take place
                    in the <a href="/organizations/nym">society atNew York<orgname key="nym"></orgname></a>, until after
                        <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s death, yet as he,<br/>from the
                    beginning, took such a deep interest in the<br/>controversy, which was carried
                    on for many years<br/>previous to this event, it becomes the duty of
                    his<br/>biographer to allude to it.</p>
<p>A late celebrated minister in the society, who, from<br/>his strong natural
                    talents, purity of life, and patri-<br/>archal appearance, had obtained
                    unbounded influence<br/>over a large portion of the members, for many
                    years<br/>previous to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s death, was
                    very active and<br/>zealous in propagating his peculiar sentiments upon<br/>the
                    doctrines of the atonement and divinity of our<br/>Saviour. Without meaning, in
                    the least, to call in<br/>question his sincerity, or the purity of his
                    motives,<br/>it must be admitted, that he held opinions on those<br/>important
                    doctrines, and also respecting the holy<br/>scriptures, which differed
                    materially from those held<br/>by <a href="/people/rbarc1">Robert
                        Barclay<persname key="rbarc1"></persname></a>, and the early Quakers. They<br/>ever believed in the
                    divinity of the Saviour, and in<br/>the efficacy of the outward atonement, in
                    conjunc-<br/>tion with spiritual regeneration; whilst <emph rend="italic">he</emph> lowered<br/>the character of the Redeemer, to that of a <emph rend="italic">good man</emph>,<br/>and holy pattern, and denied the efficacy
                    of the<br/>atonement altogether, relying solely on the regene-<br/>ration, as a
                    means of Salvation. The founders of<br/>the society also, uniformly upheld the
                    authenticity<br/>and inspiration of the scriptures, declaring them to<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_337" n="341"></pb>be the only outward standard for determining the<br/>soundness of
                    their doctrines, and the truth of their<br/>principles; whilst this modern
                    preacher frequently<br/>called in question their divine authority. </p>
<p>
<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, and other influential members of
                    the<br/>society, took an active part in endeavouring to arrest<br/>the progress,
                    of what they considered heterodox opi-<br/>nions, and they always openly
                    declared, that the<br/>doctrines promulgated by the preacher before
                    men-<br/>tioned, were contrary to the fundamental principles<br/>of the society,
                    and that therefore they could have no<br/> unity with him. <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was one of the warmest<br/>advocates in
                    favour of orthodox opinions, and one of<br/>the earliest to detect the
                    heterodoxy of the new prin-<br/>ciples. Regardless of worldly consequences, he
                    had<br/>the courage openly and honestly to avow his senti-<br/>ments, and thus
                    became unpopular with those in the<br/> society, who took the opposite side; but
                    this moved<br/>him not—and he continued, through evil report and<br/>good
                    report, to show his marked disapprobation of<br/>those doctrines, until his
                    death.</p>
<p>No cause was so dear to his heart, as the interests<br/> of the society in which
                    he was born and educated,<br/>and for which he always manifested the most
                    ardent<br/>attachment; he, therefore, most deeply deplored the<br/> division of
                    sentiment, upon what he considered vital<br/>principles.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/lym">yearly meeting of Friends<orgname key="lym"></orgname></a> in England, which<br/>may be aptly termed the <emph rend="italic">parent society</emph>, has officially<br/>pronounced its
                    condemnation of the novel doctrines<br/>which were promulgated here, and refuses
                    to hold<br/>any intercourse with the Society in this country,<br/>which
                    sanctions those doctrines.</p>
<p>So far, therefore, as human authority goes, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr.Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s opinions have been completely sustained;<br/>and
                    although he did not live to witness the division<br/> in the Society which now
                    exists, yet he clearly fore-<br/>saw, many years ago, that such must inevitably
                    be<br/>the result of the controversy. </p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_338" n="342"></pb>
<p> The celebrated preacher alluded to, has since fol-<br/>lowed <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> to the silent grave;—they are
                    both<br/>removed beyond the sphere of human praise or cen-<br/>sure, and we may
                    safely leave them in the hands of<br/>Him who judgeth righteously, and who alone
                    knoweth<br/>the secrets of all hearts.</p>
<p>When the mind is serene, there is nothing of the<br/>value of life lost in
                    pungent regret for hasty conduct<br/>and irritable feelings, and nothing by the
                    intoxica-<br/>ting influence of inordinate joy. To one prepared to<br/>be happy
                    by religious philosophy and self-discipline,<br/> bent on pursuing <quote>the
                        even tenor of his way,</quote> curi-<br/>osity, desire of knowledge, and
                    love of fame, <quote>the<br/>last infirmity of noble minds,</quote> are all
                    subservient to<br/> happiness.</p>
<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> had fine powers of conversation.
                    He<br/>was gently animated in speaking in public or pri-<br/>vate, and seemed to
                    proceed with ease and fluency.<br/>If his eloquence had nothing in it of the
                    force of the<br/>rapid stream, or the sweep of the tide, still it was<br/>more
                    difficult to resist; it was like the gentle drop-<br/>pings whose continuance
                    will wear away the stone.<br/>He had no equal in managing a matter before a
                    deli-<br/>berative body. He watched the <q><emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">mollia tempora<br/>fandi</foreign></emph>,</q>
                    and said no more than just what was wanted<br/>for the occasion. He was
                    unruffled when hardly<br/> listened to, and sometimes rudely treated; but at
                    the<br/>next interview, it was seen that he had made an im-<br/>pression on him,
                    who had, perhaps, in a moment of<br/> irritation, turned hastily away. Most
                    minds are to<br/>be won, if the suitor only knows the means, and<br/>notices the
                    proper seasons for his appliances.</p>
<p>He was conscious that he was acting for the pub-<br/>lic good, and was therefore
                    always self-possessed.</p>
<p>As a neighbour, <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was kind and
                    obliging,<br/>and attentive to all the little courtesies of life, and<br/>was
                    loved and respected by those near him, which<br/>cannot always be said even of
                    those who are striving<br/>to benefit mankind.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_339" n="343"></pb>
<p>In the domestic circle he was pleasant and instruc-<br/>tive, and seemed desirous
                    of filling up every hour as<br/>of some value to himself and to others. He
                    seemed<br/>desirous of examining the mind and habits of the<br/>young, in order
                    to assist them in gathering up pro-<br/>per stores of knowledge, and of giving a
                    right direc-<br/>tion to their affections. This communion with<br/>young minds
                    is as beneficial to those in years, as to<br/>the youth who listens to the
                    lessons of age. The<br/>fresh and novel views of the world, coming all
                    unso-<br/>phisticated from the young, awaken the recollections<br/>of youth in
                    the mind of one near the grave, and he<br/>seems to travel back again with
                    pleasure to the days<br/>when every vision was bright, and hope had
                    not<br/>known the companion of her later years—disappoint-<br/>ment. The value
                    of existence will unquestionably<br/>be increased, when we come to understand by
                    the<br/>mental improvements which are going on, how much<br/>good we may do, and
                    of how much happiness we<br/>are susceptible.</p>
<p>The person of <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> bore no
                    extraordinary<br/>marks to the casual observer. He was about five<br/>feet six
                    inches in height, of a muscular, compact<br/>frame, capable of bearing great
                    fatigue without in-<br/>convenience, and he delighted in corporeal activity
                    as<br/>well as mental exertion. His head was large and<br/>well shaped, the
                    features of his face were strong and<br/>prominent, and his whole physiognomy
                    bold and<br/>striking. The elevation of his eyebrows gave the<br/>whole
                    countenance an air of profound meditation.<br/>He dressed with great uniformity
                    and neatness. If<br/>his face bore deep traces of thought, there were
                    none<br/>of grief. He commemorated the death of his friend<br/>with pious and
                    affectionate propriety, but indulged<br/>in no feverish lamentations at their
                    departure, bow-<br/>ing in humble resignation to the will of heaven.<br/>He had
                    been failing for several months, but at<br/>last his death was as sudden as his
                    life was serene.<br/>He died on the <date when="1827-09-16">16th of September,
                        1827</date>, in the sixty- <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_340" n="344"></pb>ninth year of his age, of
                    paralysis. He, who had<br/>done so much to alleviate the sufferings of
                    others,<br/>was not doomed to suffer much himself. For him<br/>death had no
                    sting and the grave no victory. The<br/>sweet precepts and holy influence of
                    Christianity had<br/>destroyed both.</p>
<p>More than four years previous to <a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>'s
                    death,<br/>he withdrew himself from the affairs of the <a href="/places/newyh">NewYork Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, as appears by the following note,
                    in<br/>order that the institution might have the benefit of<br/>the services of

                        <p>In the death of <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, which was
                            men-<br/>tioned in our paper of yesterday, the community<br/>have lost a
                            most worthy and benevolent individual,<br/>and the Society of Friends,
                            to which he belonged, a<br/>most respectable and valuable member. A
                            large<br/>portion of a long life has been spent in active
                            useful-<br/>ness, and in promoting, by his efficient aid,
                            almost<br/>every public institution of charity and benevolence.<br/>For
                            a long time he has been concerned in the go-<br/>vernment of the
                                <a href="/places/newyh">Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a> of this city; and it is,
                            in<br/>a great measure, owing to his exertions, that the<br/> Lunatic
                            Asylum was established and endowed.</p>
<p>He was an early friend and supporter of the Peni-<br/>tentiary system of
                            punishment;—a zealous patron of<br/> the free schools, he encouraged, to

                            extension<br/>of general education; he was a most cordial friend<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_342" n="346"></pb>of freedom, and a most determined opposer of

<p><a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> was, from the establishment of

                        Commercial Advertiser, <date when="1827-09">September,
                            1827</date>.
                        <p>DIED, yesterday morning, in the 70th year of his<br/>age, <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a>, for many years a highly
                            respect-<br/>able and useful citizen. He was an active member<br/>of
                            most of our charitable institutions, in whose wel-<br/>fare and
                            prosperity he was deeply interested, and in<br/>whose service most of
                            the latter part of his life was<br/>spent. As a governor of the
                                <a href="/places/newyh">New York Hospital<placename key="newyh"></placename></a>, he<br/>was
                            eminently useful, and by his firmness of character, <br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_343" n="347"></pb>and close application to the interest of the establish-<br/>ment,
                            filled the highest offices therein, to the entire<br/> approbation of
                            his constituents. He was a firm and<br/>constant advocate of the
                            Lancasterian system of edu-<br/>cation, and of the immense importance of
                            public cha-<br/>rity schools, in whose welfare he felt a deep and
                            lively<br/> interest. His services as a director of the <a href="/organizations/ambib">AmericanBible Society<orgname key="ambib"></orgname></a>, were duly
                            appreciated by his fellow<br/>members, and by them his loss will be
                            deeply regret-<br/>ted. To the descendants of Africa he was a
                            sincere<br/>and valuable friend, deeply sympathizing with them<br/>in
                            their low and degraded state, and endeavouring<br/>by every means in his
                            power, to break the shackles<br/>which bind them to the cruel yoke of
                            their oppressors.<br/>He was an early advocate for internal
                            improvements;<br/>and his name will be found among the first
                            commis-<br/>sioners for the construction of the <geogname key="eriec">Erie canal</geogname>.</p>
<p>In short, he was a charitable, a philanthropic, and<br/>a good citizen, a
                            kind father, and a tender husband.</p>
<p> His funeral will take place on Tuesday afternoon,<br/>the <date when="1827-09-18">18th instant</date>, at 4 o'clock, from his late
                            residence,<br/>424 Broome street. In the death of this
                            gentleman,<br/>whose life has been long dedicated to deeds of
                            cha-<br/>rity and benevolence, our city sustains no common<br/>loss. His
                            friends and connexions, and the members<br/>of the various societies
                            with which he was associated,<br/>are respectfully invited to attend his
                            funeral.</p>

                        National Gazette, <a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>.
                        <p>An obituary notice of <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> of
                                <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>,<br/>was copied into our
                            sheet yesterday, from the <a href="/places/nycit">NewYork<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> papers. It bears a just testimony, which
                            we<br/>were glad to repeat, and to which we would add an<br/>humble
                            tribute on our own part, arising from per-<br/>sonal acquaintance, and a
                            deep impression of the<br/>excellence of his character. Unaffected,
                            inexhausti-<br/>ble goodness; sound sense; extensive information<br/>on
                            the practical interests and objects of society; anx-<br/>ious,
                            indefatigable benevolence—were the leading<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_344" n="348"></pb>traits which
                            gained for him an extraordinary share<br/>of fond esteem and confidence,
                            wherever he was<br/>known. He belonged to the religious
                            denomination<br/>of Friends, and in the modest simplicity of his
                            tone<br/>and habits, and the directness, equanimity, and toler-<br/>ance
                            of his spirit, as well as by the absolute useful-<br/>ness of his
                            pursuits and studies, he seemed to realize<br/>the picture which
                                <a href="/people/wpenn1">William Penn<persname key="wpenn1"></persname></a> himself sketched,
                            as<br/> that of a genuine disciple, and a true Christian, in<br/>his
                            interpretation of Christianity.</p>
<p>There are few, we believe, of the splendid internal<br/> improvements, of
                            the foundations of social charity,<br/>or the plans for the amelioration
                            of public morals<br/>and education, that have signalized, during the
                            pre-<br/>sent century, the judgment, benevolence, and enter-<br/>prise
                            of <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, with which the name of
                                <a href="/people/teddy1">ThomasEddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> is not connected,
                            with more or less original<br/>and acknowledged merit. He was among the
                            first<br/>projectors and promoters of the <geogname key="eriec">Grand
                                Canal</geogname>; he<br/>took a principal part in the establishment
                            and admin-<br/>istration of hospitals, penitentiaries, high schools,
                            and<br/>houses of refuge; he entered into all their details<br/>with
                            equal zeal and intelligence; he read, he wrote,<br/>he travelled, almost
                            without intermission, for pur-<br/>poses of common good or special
                            humanity:—he<br/>united the bias and exertions of a <a href="/people/jhowa1">Howard<persname key="jhowa1"></persname></a> and a <a href="/people/abene1">Bene-zet<persname key="abene1"></persname></a>, to those propensities and inquiries which
                            imme-<br/>diately advance the trade, agriculture, and gene-<br/>ral
                            comfort and beauty of a state. This is a rare<br/>combination of tastes
                            and endeavours, and in him it<br/>was not in the least ostentatious or
                            officious, but<br/>wore a natural, easy, unobtrusive air, suitable to
                            his<br/>whole mien and style, and never failed to prove effi-<br/>cient,
                            when it had scope and encouragement. So<br/>beneficent a being is now
                            enjoying a rest happier<br/>than that of any of his race, who worshipped
                            at<br/>shrines of false glory, and wearied their powers in<br/>seeking
                            or achieving the triumphs of ambition, vanity,<br/>or avarice. We have
                            seen men of stout hearts, but<br/><pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_345" n="349"></pb>kindred dispositions,
                            moved to tears, in first contem-<br/>plating <a href="/people/teddy1">Thomas Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> after a certain period of sepa-<br/>ration.
                            We never approached him without expe-<br/>riencing a moral refreshment,
                            analogous to the phy-<br/>sical sensation produced by a pure, elastic,
                            balmy<br/> atmosphere. The same delightful influence is always<br/>shed,
                            in a measure, by veteran, unequivocal, active<br/>virtue; but the
                            artlessness and serenity attending the<br/>source in this instance, the
                            plain dress, the homely<br/> visage, the kindly eye, the chastened tone,
                            and unso-<br/>phisticated reason, caused it to be felt by more
                            minds<br/>with superior force. It is merely justice to add, that<br/>the
                            individuals and circles with whom this philan-<br/>thropist communed and
                            acted in <a href="/places/nycit">New York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, appre-<br/>ciated
                            and honoured his peculiar worth, and will long<br/>praise and cherish
                            his genial memory. All were<br/>alive to that spontaneous and invariable
                            emanation<br/>of goodness which we have just noticed—all must<br/>be
                            aware of its rarity, and regret its loss in any one<br/>example. </p>

                            be difficult to fill. His usefulness can<br/>be traced to our
                            institutions of reform, education, and<br/>benevolence.</p>
<p>He has followed his excellent coadjutors in the<br/>same glorious cause,

<a href="/people/teddy1">Mr. Eddy<persname key="teddy1"></persname></a> left a widow, a son, and two
                    daughters,<br/>to mourn his loss, and to cherish his memory. <a href="/people/heddy1">Mrs.Eddy<persname key="heddy1"></persname></a> died the summer of <date when="1832">1832</date>. She fell a victim to<br/>that scourge of the human race—the
                    cholera. She<br/>was a virtuous woman, highly respected by all who<br/>knew her.
                    She was a helpmate to her spouse, as<br/>far as was proper for her sex, in all
                    his labours of<br/>philanthropy. The silent unobtrusive course of a<br/>good
                    wife, has a wonderful influence on the charac-<br/>ter and fame of her husband.
