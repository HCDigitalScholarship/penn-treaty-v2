<p> The James Cooper manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed Cooper’s manuscript as part of a larger project to make
                    the library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: Ashley Acle (3-10), Nilo Bermeo (11-18), Youda Cao
                    (19-26), Christine DeNizio (27-42), Anna Sagaser (43-50), and Brent Stanfield
                    (51-58). Transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by
                    Professor Murray. </p>

<editorialdecl>
<p>The transcribers and editor attempted to render James Cooper’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when Cooper’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of Cooper’s Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans
                    who populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and
                    editor attempted to remain faithful to Cooper’s Anglicized spellings in all
                    cases.</p>
<p>The author of the original journal, James Cooper, does not include page numbers
                    on his manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers
                    to correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

<salute>To the great Sachem and Chiefs of the State of New-York, now
                                sitting<br/> around the great councill fire at
                            New-York</salute></opener>
<p> Brothers, Before you cover your council-fire, We beg your at<br/>tention
                            to the Voice of your Brethren the different Tribes living<br/> Oneida
                            Country – speaks to you in remembrance of the friend<br/>ship you have
                            manifested toward them in all their Treaties<br/> We ourselves have held
                            Counsels at different times to<br/> contemplate the welfare of our
                            nations, because we cannot<br/> but groan to see our situation – It is
                            also melancholy to<br/> reflect on the ways of our forefathers</p>
<p> Brothers you are sometimes sorry to see the deplorable situ<br/>ation of
                            your Indian Brethren, for which you have<br/> given us many good
                            Counsels though we feel ourselves willing<br/> to follow your Counsel,
                                <del>though we feel ourselves willing to follow your Counsel</del>,
                            but it has made no effect as yet<br/> our situation is still miserable –
                            Our ancestors were<br/> Conquered immediately after you came over this
                            Island<br/>– By the strong heroe who does still reign among<br/> Indian
                            Tribes with tyranny, -- who has rob'd us every<br/>thing that was
                            precious on our eyes– But we not men<br/>tion everything particular how
                            this Tyrant has used<br/> us – For your eyes have been open to behold
                            our dismal<br/> Situation – By the power of our enemy our eyes have<br/>
                            been blinded. – Our Young men seems become willing<br/> Slaves to this
                            Despotic Heroe – so that we displeased the<br/> great <del>Spirit</del>
                            Good spirit, and could not become Civilized<br/> People – in looking
                            back we see nothing but desolation<br/> of our mighty men – In looking
                            forward we see the<br/> desolation of our tribes – Our Chiefs has used their<br/>

                            success they seems discouraged and hang down<br/> their heads. ~ </p>
<p> Brothers – In remembrance of your kind promises We write<br/> our cries
                            to you for help – Perhaps you are ready<br/> to think what man that must
                            be that has abused<br/> so much of our Brethren – never was such Heroe
                            or Tyrant<br/> heard that ever meddled with Indians<br/> – but in
                            literally he is your only begotten son<br/> – &amp; his name you call
                            Rum – And the names of his<br/> Officers are Brandy - Wine &amp; Gin – </p>
<p> And we know you have power to controul him<br/> – And as we desire to
                            live in peace &amp; to become Civilized<br/> nations – We earnestly
                            entreat you to use your<br/> power &amp; Wisdom to prevent all people
                            whether White<br/> or Black who may cause rum and other Spiritous<br/>
                            liquors throughout your State to come into the hands of<br/> our Tribes
                            except when sickness required our Chiefs may keep little for that
                            purpose – For your compliance with this our request<br/> – We will ever

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/haupa1">Hendrick<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a> in behalf of <del>the</del> his

                    were<br/> glad of <del>the</del> our offer <del>to them</del> that they believed
                    we were<br/> there true Friends. But that he remembered that we<br/> said that
                    after trying them for a while and there appeared<br/> no improvement among them
                        <del>that</del> then we should be discouraged<br/> from giving them any more
                    assistance, which he<br/> hoped might not be the case* But if they should
                    make<br/> improvement they wanted to know if their Brothers<br/> and friends
                        <del>the Quakers</del> would then continue to help<br/> them or no. They
                    were answered we were in hopes<br/> that if they were but industrious and sober
                    and minded our<br/> counsel &amp; our friends instruction that stayed with them<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JC1796_031" n="29"></pb> they would want but little more help from their friends<br/>
<del>the Counsel pretty soon broke up after this</del> this appear'd to<br/> be
                    but an artfull Query to draw from Friends a promise<br/> altho it might be but a
                    slender one yet they would hold<br/> them bound to their engagements
                        <del>thereby</del> as tho there were or had<br/> been the strongest
                    covenants, so the Counsel ended. In the<br/> afternoon our friend <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jevan1">Joshua<persname key="jevan1"></persname></a> had a meeting with them<br/> to a pretty good
                    degree of satisfaction, having before at the<br/> Counsel mentioned it &amp; the

                    therefore modestly refused after some time the<br/> Old Interpreter came altho
                    he appeared a little in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JC1796_032" n="30"></pb> yet we believed he was not so much as to render him<br/> incapable and after
                    a little time appeared it with<br/> repeating &amp; Imprinting the former
                    agreement<br/> between Us and them relative to our farm &amp;<br/> things
                    relative, to the carrying it on, which was now<br/> drawn and signed by Us, with

                    it had not been held in town some of<br/> whom were the principal people of the
                    place, offering the<br/> Court House if he would appoint a meeting in the
                    afternoon<br/> which they seem'd desirous of. Our friend seem'd to incline<br/>
                    so to do &amp; accordingly notice was given &amp; four o’clock the time<br/>
                    appointed to meet. Near <del>the</del> the time several of our friends<br/> went
