<p>The Hartshorne journal is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of
                    Swarthmore College. During 2014 staff of Friends Historical Library and
                    Swarthmore College students began a project to encode seventeen journals which
                    document interaction between Quakers and Native Americans in New York State and
                    Ohio between 1793 and 1806.</p>

<p> On First Day the <date when="1793-05-04">4th of the 5th Mo 1793</date> at<br/> 9
                    o'clock in the evening left New York in order<br/> to attend the Treaty to be
                    held with the Indians<br/> at <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, near
                    the West end of <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>.</p>
<p> Our company who were going the same<br/> rout consisted of <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/wsave1">William
                        Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a>,<br/>
<a href="/people/rhill1">Rich'd Hillary<persname key="rhill1"></persname></a>, a young Englishman, <a href="/people/jheck1">John Hackenwelder<persname key="jheck1"></persname></a>, a Minister among the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/moravian">Moravians<orgname key="moravian"></orgname></a>, <a href="/people/wmcco1">Dr. William
                        McCoskry<persname key="wmcco1"></persname></a>, and Captain<br/> Scott, Commissary to the
                    Commissioners.<br/> We had an indifferent passage<br/> up the river, part of the
                    way being<br/> in the Night, and arrived at <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> on the 8th,<br/> about 5 in the morning.- <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> appears<br/> to be a place of considerable
                    trade, some of<br/> the Houses are well Built, the streets mostly<br/> paved,
                    but some of them very narrow and<br/> irregularly laid out -- here the Low
                    Dutch<br/> Language is generally spoken, and the<br/> manners of the inhabitants
                    not esteemed<br/> very pleasing. At <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> we
                    found <a href="/people/glinc1">General Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, one of the
                    commissioners, and ChS Stover,<br/> their Secretary -- upon our arrival with
                    the<br/> Stores, <a href="/people/glinc1">General Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a> was desirous
                    of going<br/> immediately to <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>, and
                    with considerable<br/> difficulty, and many hours delay, at length<br/> procured
                    a Horse and Chair, and without an<br/> Attendant, about 6 in the Evening, set
                    off for that<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_02" n="2"></pb> that place -- we tarried all night and<br/>
                    found very indifferent entertainment.</p>

<p> Having procured Waggons we left <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a><br/>
                    about 8 A.M. and went to <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>
                    were<br/> we arrived about 11 -- <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>
                    lays about<br/> l6 ½ miles N.W. from <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>,
                    is a pretty well<br/> built handsome inland Town, a place of con-<br/>siderable
                    Trade, being the carrying place between<br/> the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname> and <geogname key="huds">Hudson</geogname>'s Rivers --
                    here, as at<br/>
<a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a>, the language is Low Dutch. – The
                    Land<br/> between <a href="/places/alban">Albany<placename key="alban"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> is Sandy &amp; poor,<br/> Timbered
                    chiefly with Pine.- At <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a><br/> we
                    found prepared for us Eight Boats or Batteaux,<br/> Six for the Baggage and
                    Stores, that would carry about<br/> a Ton and a half each, and two larger
                    with<br/> Awnings for the passengers: We embarked in our<br/> Boat about 4 P.M.
                    and proceeded seven miles up the <geogname key="mohaw">Mo-<br/>hawk</geogname>
                    River to Mabee’s, where we lodged.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-10">10th</date>. <placename key="fhunt"></placename></dateline>
<p> We proceeded up the River 15 miles &amp; encamp’d<br/> near the remains of old
                        <a href="/places/fhunt">Fort Hunter<placename key="fhunt"></placename></a>; two or three<br/> miles
                    below which we passed by the place formerly<br/> the residence of <a href="/people/wjohn3">Sir William Johnson<persname key="wjohn3"></persname></a> – We found<br/> the stream this
                    day very rapid – the Land<br/> on the Banks of the River between this &amp;
                        <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a><br/> being very beautiful and
                    fertile – the high Land at a<br/> distance appearing more rough and
                    uncultivated.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-11">11th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> Embark’d about sunrise, with a fair Wind,<br/> and having most of the way a
                    gentle current,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_03" n="3"></pb> we hoisted our sails and run 20 miles
                    up<br/> the River to <a href="/people/cfry1">Col. Fry<persname key="cfry1"></persname></a>’s, where we
                    dined, a few<br/> miles below we pass’d by a place call’d <a href="/places/fplan">Fort Plane<placename key="fplan"></placename></a>, where is a handsome Worship House and
                    other<br/> good Buildings –- After Dinner proceeded 8 miles<br/> to Nellis’s
                    Tavern where we lay all Night.- At<br/> this place were inform’d we were
                    but<br/> 15 miles from the Waters of <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, and<br/> about 40 from Delaware -

<del>Dutch</del>- Our way this day being through a<br/> most beautiful and
                    fertile country -- the<br/> Inhabitants between this and <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> are <del>being</del><br/> mostly low Dutch.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-12">12th</date>. <placename key="lfall"></placename></dateline>
<p> Got to the Little Falls about Noon (call'd 60 miles<br/> from <a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a>) -- here is a carrying Place of<br/>
                    about one Mile -- the Falls altogether are about<br/> 40 feet, preparations are
                    now making to<br/> render them navigable by Locks -- along these<br/> Falls are
                    fine mill seats, on one of which <a href="/people/jport1">John Porteous
                        Esqr<persname key="jport1"></persname></a> has erected a very good Grist Mill &amp; saw<br/> Mill --
                        <a href="/people/jlind1">Jacob Lindley<persname key="jlind1"></persname></a> and myself were kindly<br/>
                    entertained by <a href="/people/fdeza1">Major de Zeng<persname key="fdeza1"></persname></a>, superintendent
                    of<br/> the Canal business at this place.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-13">13th</date>. <placename key="gerfl"></placename></dateline>
<p> Got our Boats goods, &amp;ca. above the Falls<br/> and proceeded up the River
                    about 6 miles<br/> to a place call'd <a href="/places/gefla">Fort Herkimar, or
                        the German Flatts<placename key="gefla"></placename></a> -- The Country hereabout being very<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_04" n="4"></pb> very beautiful, and has the appearance of
                    great<br/> fertility -­ the inhabitants chiefly the descendants<br/> of Germans
                    by whom the high Dutch Language is<br/> mostly spoken.</p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1793-05-14">14th</date>. <placename key="fschy"></placename></dateline>
<p> In our progress this day we found the Country<br/> but thinly inhabited, but we
                    were informed the<br/> number of settlers were rapidly increasing<br/>
                    principally by immigration from New England<br/> and there is every reason to
                    believe that in a few<br/> years it will become well cultivated and
                    plentiful<br/> -- in the evening we stopt at <a href="/places/fschy">Fort
                        Schuyler<placename key="fschy"></placename></a><br/> 24 miles from <a href="/places/gefla">Fort

</div>
<div type="entry">

<p> After breakfast several of us went 4 miles<br/> up the River on foot to
                        <a href="/places/white">Whites Town<placename key="white"></placename></a>, the residence<br/> of
                        <a href="/people/abree1">Arthur Breese<persname key="abree1"></persname></a>, to whom I had letters --
                    it<br/> is quite a new settlement but has the appear-<br/>ance of becoming a
                    place of note, being<br/> situated in a fast improving Country, and<br/> has
                    already in it large Stores, and the finest<br/> Pot Ash works that we have yet
                    seen -- at 4<br/> P.M. stopt at <a href="/people/bsteu1">Baron
                    Steuben<persname key="bsteu1"></persname></a>'s Landing on the<br/> North side of the River, from which to
                    his House<br/> we were inform'd the distance was 7 miles<br/> and 9 to
                        <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>.- At 7 in the evening<br/>
                    arrived at the Carrying Place at <a href="/places/fstan">Fort

<p> The situation of <a href="/places/fstan">Fort Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, (although
                    upon<br/> a 1evel plain, almost surrounded by low Marshey<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_05" n="5"></pb> Land), must be very much elevated, as
                    it<br/> lays about half way between the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohock</geogname> &amp;<br/>
<geogname key="wcree">Wood Creek</geogname>, the first taking an eastern
                    course<br/> to the sea, the latter running Westerly to the<br/> Lakes.­ We were
                    inform 'd a Town was<br/> laid out near the old Fort, and that preparations<br/>
                    ware making to erect Buildings.- a Canal<br/> is intended to be out perhaps the
                    ensuing Summer<br/> from the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohock</geogname> to
                        <geogname key="wcree">Wood Creek</geogname>.- The price of<br/> Land on

                    20 pr Acre, according to the quality<br/> and State of cultivation.- The course from<br/>
<a href="/places/schen">Schenectady<placename key="schen"></placename></a> to <a href="/places/fstan">Fort
                        Stanwix<placename key="fstan"></placename></a>, I suppose to be<br/> about W.N.W., distance by water
                    about 120<br/> miles.- this day got our batteaux &amp;ca.<br/> over to <geogname key="wcree">Wood Creek</geogname>-- <geogname key="wcree">Wood

                    and the upland has the appearance of fertility<br/> – The Timber chiefly Oak,

                    to Braddocks Bay is mostly low,<br/> and level, not to exceed 40 feet in the

                    found a fine pleasant Bank 20 or 30 feet high, the<br/> soil tolerable good,
                    covered chiefly with Oak<br/> Timber - while at this place we saw two Schooners

                    the Timber<br/> which we take to be Oak appearing very<br/> tall and fine. - The

                    the entertainment<br/> was but indifferent, and the Charge very high,<br/> we

                    the proper<br/> place, are in substance as follows - He said that<br/>
                    falsehoods had been intimated by American Com-<br/>missioners at former treaties
                    with the Indians, in<br/> respect to the British Government ceeding to the<br/>
                    United States the absolute property of the Indian<br/> Country, as the price of
                    Peace, - nothing more<br/> being intended by that Article of the Treaty,
                    than<br/> the right of preemption, which he fully acknow<br/>-ledged, and said
                    that the British Government had no<br/> right to purchase Lands of the Indians
                    within<br/> the limits mark'd out by the Treaty - He fur-<br/>ther said that the
                    Indians had been treated<br/> with cruelty and injustice, and that it was<br/>
                    his opinion they never would make peace<br/> except the <geogname key="ohior">River Ohio</geogname> was made the boundary<br/> line. - He further said
                    that scandalous<br/> falsehoods had been propagated in the News<br/> papers of
                    the United States, respecting the<br/> British still keeping possession of the
                    West-<br/>ern Ports, that the only reason was the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_16" n="16"></pb> the noncompliance of the United States

<p> This morning the Rain abated - took<br/> a walk up the River.- immediately from
                    the<br/> Landing the Bank rises to the heigth of more than<br/> 150 feet above
                    the surface of the Water, - the<br/> range of high Land, extending each way
                    from<br/> the River, about an East and West course - the Land<br/> below towards
                        <geogname key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogname>, being a Level plain,<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_17" n="17"></pb> the greatest part well-timbered and
                    fertile, many<br/> beautiful settlements on the West bank of the<br/> River
                    towards <a href="/places/newar">Newark<placename key="newar"></placename></a>. - the Land after<br/> rising
                    the Hill above, towards <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>,<br/> being
                    also a plain level Country, equal in<br/> beauty and fertility to that below -
                    as far<br/> as I could discover, the Banks of the River,<br/> from the Landing
                    to the Falls, <del><gap></gap></del><br/> of the heigth, perhaps from 150 to 200
                    feet,<br/>are almost perpendicular, the greatest part<br/>of solid Rock, it
                    being the opinion of many,<br/> that the Falls were originally near the Landing,
                    but the<br/> prodigious Body of Water that precipitates down<br/> them, has worn
                    the channel, 6 or 7 miles up<br/> to its present situation – from a high
                    point<br/> on the West Bank, had a view of the River<br/> down to the Lake, and
                    by a small pocket<br/> Compass found that Fort <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a> bore from<br/> one N. by W. – In the afternoon
                        <a href="/people/wsave1">Wm. Savery<persname key="wsave1"></persname></a><br/> and myself went on Horse
                    Back to see<br/> the <geogname key="niagf">great Falls</geogname>, on the way
                    found the country thickly<br/> inhabited, all new settlements.- The River<br/>
                    just above the Falls I suppose to be a mile<br/> wide, and the depth in some
                    places 6 or 8 feet,<br/> this prodigious body of water, conjectured to be<br/>
                    more than double the quantity that comes down<br/> the Falls of Delaware near
                    Trenton, with<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_18" n="18"></pb> amazing rapiddity shoots over the edge of
                    a<br/> solid perpendicular Rock, and Falls (according to<br/>
                    A. Elliotts account) 137 feet
                        -<del><gap></gap></del><br/><del><gap></gap></del><br/> - for about a mile above the
                    great Fall, there is<br/> a continued succession of Cataracts, some of<br/> them
                    3 or 4 feet perpendicular, this greatly en-<br/>creases the rapiddity of the
                    current, until it comes<br/> to the edge of the Precipice, over which it dashes
                        -<del><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap></del></p>
<p> The River at the Falls is divided by a small<br/> flat Island, of perhaps 250
                    yards in width, and twice<br/> that number in length - the sides and upper
                    end,<br/> not much elevated above the surface of the River<br/> above the Falls,
                    the lower end, which is on a line<br/> with the Falls, is a smooth perpendicular
                    Rook, I suppose<br/> of about 150 feet high.- The edge of the Rock over<br/>
                    which the water Falls, on the East side of the Island,<br/><del><gap></gap></del>, is
                    nearly a straight line,<br/> and the River, on that side, I suppose to be 250
                    yards<br/> wide, but the Water not so deep as on the West side<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_19" n="19"></pb> where its width is the
                        same<del><gap></gap></del> - the<br/> edge of the Rook, on this side, forms near
                        about<del><gap></gap></del><br/> half a Circle, the convex side
                        upwards<del><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap><br/><gap></gap></del><br/> --The quantity of Water
                    that passes on the West side,<br/> I suppose to be double that which passes on
                    the<br/> East side of the Island, being in the middle 6 or 8<br/> feet deep
                    above the Falls.- It is said that by<br/> actual survey there is found to be 50
                    feet fall in the<br/> one mile of Rapids just above the Falls, and<br/> from
                    thence down to the Landing, 6 or 7 miles,<br/> the rappidity of the River
                    renders it altogether<br/> impassable, in that distance the fall must be<br/>
                    very considerable, so that taking the whole<br/> into view, we may conclude,
                    that the surface<br/> of the Water of <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                    Erie</geogname>, is nearly 300 feet above<br/> that of <geogname key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogname>, the distance between these<br/> Lakes being only
                    36 miles.</p>

<p> On coming upon Deck this morning we<br/> were agree­ably surprised to find

                    both sides - the father we advanced up, the<br/> beauty of the prospect
                    increased, and when we<br/> came within 6 or 7 miles of the Town, a sight<br/>
                    of the kind more pleasing, I think I never saw.</p>

<p> The Country here was first settled<br/> by the French, it is said above one
                    hundred years ago,<br/> whose decendants, in a general way, are still the<br/>
                    Proprietors, and by whom that Language (with<br/> but few exceptions) is only
                    spoken. - The front<br/> of each Lot on the River being but narrow, is<br/>
                    almost wholly taken up with Buildings, Gardens<br/> and fine thrifty orchards,
                    so that it has almost<br/> the appearance oft one continu­ ous Village quite
                    up<br/> to the Town - we sometimes could count four<br/> or five Windmills in
                    sight at once, and a<br/> pretty large Romish Chapple stands on the East<br/>
                    side of the River, about 4 miles above the town.<br/>- about 9 A.M. came to an

                    stands on the west side of the River, is<br/> a compact dirty little Town,

<p> Upon our arrival at <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>, after<br/> some
                    enquiry, took up our quarters at the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_23" n="23"></pb> house of <a href="/people/mdols1">Matthew
                        Dolsen<persname key="mdols1"></persname></a>, who keeps a good<br/> table and an orderly House, - we
                    lay upon our<br/> own Mattresses, and pay 4/ per day each, for<br/> our diet,
                    exclusive of Liquor - Imported Goods<br/> are double the price they are in
                    the<br/> United States, and Country produce nearly<br/> as high - a good calf is
                    sold for £4.10 N.Y. Curr.,<br/> a Cow for £15.-, - Wheat 12/ per Bushel, -<br/>
                    Salt 60/ per bushel. Soon after our arrival<br/> went out to visit Captain John
                    a Chief<br/> of the <geogname key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogname>s, and other Indians,
                    who were<br/> our fellow passengers on board the Dunmore,<br/> we found them
                    sober, and had some friendly<br/> conversation with them, endeavoring to<br/>
                    inform them of our motives of leaving<br/> home, with which they seemed well
                    pleas'd,<br/> and assured us of their hearty friendship<br/> - but the next day
                    exhibited a very different<br/> scene - the War dance­ Captain John<br/> and
                    most of his party were drunk - they<br/> were almost naked and frightfully
                    painted<br/> which with their Yells, musick and Tomahocks<br/> afforded an
                    entertainment, by no means<br/> pleasing - before they came to the door of<br/>
                    our Lodging, Captain John, who did<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_24" n="24"></pb> not join in the Dance, came forward, to
                    assure<br/> us, that no injury was intended - We were obliged<br/> to give them
                    a little Cyder and Tobacco. - It is a<br/> regulation in this Garrison that no
                    Indian is<br/> allowed to remain within the Picquet all night,<br/>- on the 13th
                    Captain John, and his party, set<br/> off to attend the great Council of
                    Indian<br/> Tribes, to be held, previous to the Treaty, at the<br/> Rapids of
                    the <geogname key="miamr">Miami River</geogname>.</p>

                    soon grew furious, calling<br/> us in their way, long knife, and on our

                    and violent gestures, insisted<br/> upon our returning, which we declined
                    doing,<br/> and walk'd away - we were afterwards<br/> informed, by a person who

                    that they said they wanted us to go back that<br/> they might take our scalps -

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_25" n="25"></pb> his head decorated with black feathers,

                    more than 2000 Leagues from Montreal. - this evening<br/> we were all invited to

<p> This morning sail'd the Snow <a href="/organizations/ojibwe">Chippeway<orgname key="ojibwe"></orgname></a><br/> for
                        <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, in whom went passenger
                        <a href="/people/rhill1">Richd. Hillery<persname key="rhill1"></persname></a>, by whom I wrote to
                    New York.</p>
<p> Friends agreed with <a href="/people/mdols1">M.Dolsen<persname key="mdols1"></persname></a> to supply<br/>
                    the <a href="/organizations/moraind">Moravian Indians<orgname key="moraind"></orgname></a> with Corn and Flour,<br/>
                    to the value of one hundred Dollars, part of<br/> which was this morning
                    delivered,<br/> for which they appear'd to be very grateful.</p>
<p> Dined with <a href="/people/jaski1">John Askin<persname key="jaski1"></persname></a> Esqr., a Merchant<br/>
                    of this place, by whom we were very agreeably<br/> entertained. - he, in some
                    measure, corrobe-<br/>rated the account given by the Canadian on<br/> the 22nd
                    respecting the North West Trade - he<br/> says that from a place called the
                    Grand Portage,<br/> at the upper end of the Lakes, they travel above<br/> 2000
                    miles to the Westward, in small bark<br/> Canoes so light that two Men carry
                    them <del><gap></gap></del> - all the pro-<br/>vision, allowed to each Man for this
                    long<br/> voyage, being no more than one bushel of<br/> Indian Corn, that has
                    been boil'd in Lye and hull'd<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_32" n="32"></pb> and a little greese* (of what kind I know
                    not)<br/> to mix with it.- this stock of corn is reserved<br/> for extraordinary
                    occasions when they can<br/> neither get Fish or kill anything with their
                    Guns.<br/>- the Labouring People, in these long and tedious<br/> journeys, are
                    all Canadians, who eat their<br/> Fish and Flesh without either bread or
                        <del>and</del> Salt<br/> - at Dinner we had fresh Fish brought in<br/> a
                    Sloop, six days from <geogname key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogname>, they<br/>
                    were the White Fish and Salmon trout, they<br/> would weigh about 6 lb. each,
                    both exceeding good, but<br/> the White Fish, I think, rather preferable -
                    in<br/> the afternoon arrived the Sloop Felicity from<br/>
<geogname key="grand">Grand River</geogname> on <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname>, in her came a<br/> number of Indians <del>Passengers</del>
                    - in conversation<br/> with <a href="/people/melli1">M.Elliott<persname key="melli1"></persname></a>, he gave
                    it as his opinion, that<br/> four weeks would yet elapse before the
                        <del>commi</del><br/> Treaty began.</p>

<p> had some conversation with <a href="/people/cdrak1">Capt Drake<persname key="cdrak1"></persname></a>,<br/> an
                    intelligent Man, who has for several years<br/> navigated a Vessell on the
                    Lakes, by him was<br/> inform'd that from Detroit to the entrance of Lake</p>

<p>
<geogname key="lakst">Lake St.Clair</geogname> was about 6 miles, the
                    length<br/> of said Lake 21 miles, from the N.W. end of<br/>
<geogname key="lakst">Lake St. Clair</geogname> to the entrance of <geogname key="lakeh">Lake Huron</geogname>,<br/> through a very beautiful River, 15
                    Leagues, from<br/> the lower end of <geogname key="lakeh">Lake Huron</geogname>
                    to the rapids<br/> of St.Mary's (the entrance into <geogname key="lakes">Lake
                        Superior</geogname>),<br/> 72 Leagues, at the rapids of St.Mary's there<br/>
                    is a portage of a mile and a half, when goods<br/> are again shipped in large
                    Vessells, who<br/> carry them 100 Leagues up <geogname key="lakes">Lake
                        Superior</geogname> to what is called<br/> the Grand Portage, from whence
                    they go<br/> in small Canoes, to the North west.- He says<br/> that there are
                    above One thousand Men<br/> constantly employed in the N.W. Trade<br/> above the
                    Grand Portage. - He further says<br/> there are many mistakes in the drafts
                    heretofore<br/> made of the Lakes, they not being done from<br/> actual surveys,
                    but principally from<br/> the vague reports of Canadian traders &amp;ca. -
                    that<br/> the tales that have been told respecting <del>Thund</del><br/> Thunder
                    Bay in <geogname key="lakeh">Lake Huron</geogname> is altogether a<br/> farce,
                    that in the course of many years, which<br/> he has <del>now</del> sail'd upon
                    that Lake, he never<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_34" n="34"></pb> was sensible of more thunder there, than
                    at<br/> any other place on the Lake - that the<br/> length of <geogname key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogname> ie much less than<br/> generally
                    represented, and that from two<br/> opposite points, about the middle of
                    said<br/> Lake, the width does not exceed 70 miles.</p>

<p> Very warm and sultry with Thunder<br/> and rain. - about 10 at Night<br/> five
                    or six Guns were fired just without the<br/> Pickets, which, at first, as we lay
                    in Bed,<br/> alarmed us not a little, but we were desired<br/> to make ourselves
                    easy, as, in all probability,<br/> it was nothing more than some people who<br/>
                    had been watching for Wolves, or <emph rend="underline">shooting<br/>at

<p> Visited by a Chief of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wiandot Indians<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a><br/>
                    who was sober and intelligent, he spoke<br/> respectfully of our Society, and
                    said that<br/> many Belts of Wampum, and other <del>mem</del><br/> memorials of
                    ancient Friendship received<br/> from them, were still carefully preserved<br/>
                    by their Nation. - expressed the satisfaction he<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_35" n="35"></pb> felt in seeing so many of the people
                    call'd<br/> Quakers, and said, as the Great Spirit had<br/> been with them,
                    brought them so far -<br/> through the Wilderness, and preserved them<br/> all
                    in good health, so he hoped, he would still<br/> continue to be their rotector
                    through every<br/> danger, and carry them safe home.</p>
<p> being in Company with <a href="/people/nwill1">Nathan Williams<persname key="nwill1"></persname></a>, a

                    <del>acquain</del><br/> acquainted with the Indians - he express'd<br/> his
                    apprehensions on our account,<br/> and openly gave it as his opinion, that<br/>
                    if we attended the Treaty, we should either<br/> be kill'd, or detained as
                    Prisoners.</p>
<p> were informed that the Guns we heard <del><gap></gap></del><br/> last Night, were
                    fired at Wolves, by People who<br/> were watching <del>for them</del>, near the

<p> First day - early this morning had a<br/> Visit from the Blind Chief, a head Man among<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_36" n="36"></pb> among the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wiandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, with several of<br/> his attendants, they were sober,
                    and what<br/> is remarkable, neither these Men, nor<br/> those that visited us
                    yesterday, made any<br/> request for Rum. - at 10 A.M. had a<br/> Meeting in the
                    Sail Loft, and another at<br/> the same place at 5 in the Afternoon, at<br/>
                    both of which were a pretty large number<br/> of Soldiers, and Towns people, and
                    a few<br/> of the officers of the Garrison, their conduct<br/> generally was

                    and<br/> satisfactory.- In the evening there<br/> was a Marriage at our
                    Lodgings, - the<br/> Young Man is a settler upon the River<br/> La Trench, and a
                    Nephew to our Landlord<br/>
<a href="/people/mdols1">M.Dolsen<persname key="mdols1"></persname></a>, the Young Woman is a Native<br/> of

                    Commissioners<br/> from Philadelphia, and another from <a href="/places/fpitt1">Fort Pitt<placename key="fpitt1"></placename></a>, - various are the reports here, some<br/>
                    favourable, others exceedingly discouraging,<br/> but having no accounts from

                    intelligence. - The Ottaway<br/> brought a great number of Indians from<br/>

                    with <a href="/people/cbutl1">Colonel Butler<persname key="cbutl1"></persname></a>, he inform'd us

                    Indians were not complyed with, it was<br/> his opinion, <del>that</del> the

<p> The weather for several days past<br/> being very sultry, Our Landlord invited
                    the<br/> whole of our Company, viz. Six Friends,<br/>
<a href="/people/wwils1">Wm.Wilson<persname key="wwils1"></persname></a>, (Merchant from <a href="/places/fpitt1">Fort Pitt<placename key="fpitt1"></placename></a> &amp; Indian<br/> interpretter,)

                    about five<br/> miles below on the opposite side of the<br/> River.- We set off
                    about 9 oClock, taking<br/> with us provision &amp;ca., and spent an<br/>
                    agreeable day under a pleasant Shade on<br/> the Banks of the River, - returning
                    home<br/> in the afternoon we cross'd the River, and<br/> some of us landed at
                    the Spring Well &amp; walk'd<br/> home, the distance being three miles, and
                    the<br/> Road very pleasant.</p>

<p> Perplex'd with various reports, and<br/> contradictory opinions.- it is said,
                    the<br/> American A:rmy ie still advancing, and<br/> that an encampment is form
                    'd, in front of<br/>
<a href="/places/fjeff">Fort Jefferson<placename key="fjeff"></placename></a>, within 30 miles of where
                    the<br/> last Battle was fought.- that the Indians<br/> are more &amp; more
                    settled in their <del><gap></gap></del><br/> determination, that nothing short of
                    the<br/> boundary line being fixt on the <geogname key="ohior">River
                        Ohio</geogname>,<br/> will ever induce them to lay down the<br/> Hatchet, -
                    that, in consequence of this<br/> resolution, they have sent a deputation<br/>
                    to the Commissioners at <a href="/places/niaga">Niagara<placename key="niaga"></placename></a>, in
                    order,<br/> if their instructions does not impower<br/> them to make such a
                    Cession, to prevent<br/> their taking the unnecessary trouble of<br/> coming
                    forward any further.- indeed,<br/> it seems to be the prevailing opinion of<br/>
                    the day, that there will be no Treaty at<br/> all. - A number of Philadelphia
                    and<br/> New York News Papers came to <a href="/people/cengl1">Colt
                        England<persname key="cengl1"></persname></a><br/> by the Ottaway, some as late as the <date when="1793-06-23">23d</date> of<br/> last Month, <del>since</del> we have
                    been favour'd<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_43" n="43"></pb> with the perusal of most of them - we<br/>
                    were sorry to find some irritating and<br/> inflamatory pieces, particularly
                    one, which<br/> censures the Government of the United States,<br/> for
                    attempting to Treat with the Indians,<br/> under British influence, ungenerously<br/>
<del><gap></gap></del> branding the whole of that Nation with<br/> the opprobious
                    epithet of Cut Throats. - all<br/> the officers, that we have as yet heard
                    speak<br/> upon the subject, make light of it, and<br/> say, it is but little
                    more than what, at<br/> times, appear in their own prints -<br/> whither it is
                    really their contempt of<br/> such scandalous pieces, or their politeness,<br/>
                    which will not permit them to give us<br/> uneasiness, that makes them
                    appear<br/> so indifferent, is what I will not determine.</p>

<p> Extremely Warm &amp; sultry, light airs of<br/> Wind from the South West. -
                        <a href="/people/cmons1">Captn. Monsey<persname key="cmons1"></persname></a><br/> inform 'd us that the
                    Thermometer belonging<br/> to the Officers was, in the Shade, up to 100,<br/> in
                    the Sun it rose to 117 degrees.</p>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_44" n="44"></pb>
<p> from the best information I can gather it<br/> appears that a great proportion
                    of the Country<br/> around the Lakes is low and Marshy, so as to<br/> be wholly
                    incapable of cultivation, and in<br/> many places, of great extent, almost<br/>
                    intirely cover 'd with Water, in which grow <br/>the Timber and long Grass,
                    affording shelter<br/> for wild Beasts, and Vermin, in abundance.</p>

<p> Had an interview with a Young <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shaw--nese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>
                    Warrior, who is lately from the Council<br/> at the Rapids - his Brother is a
                    head Man<br/> amongst them, and he being often with<br/> them in Council, is
                    acquainted with the result<br/> of their deliberations, so far as they have
                    come<br/> to a conclusion among themselves - he inform'd<br/> us, there are
                    about 1200 collected at the Rapids,<br/> mostly the Northern Indians, and 700
                    of<br/> the Southern Indians, are embodied at<br/> another place, a considerable
                    distance,<br/> up the same River, watching the motions of <a href="/people/gwayn1">General Waynes<persname key="gwayn1"></persname></a><br/> Army.­ he confirms the account of a<br/>
                    Deputation being sent to the Commissioners,<br/> and that the object of their
                    Mission was, in<br/> substance, the same as has already been<br/> noted - that
                    they have most decidedly come<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_45" n="45"></pb> to a resolution, to accept of no terms
                    short of<br/> making the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> the boundary
                    line. - Our<br/> Interpretter was formerly a Prisoner among the<br/>
<a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, and had been adopted into the
                    family<br/> of this Young Man, in the place of his Father,<br/> and in their
                    discourse the Indian gave him<br/> that appellation, saying, <said who="undetermined">my Father, I will<br/> tell you what I know, and speak
                        the truth - in<br/> the begining of the World, this Land was given<br/> to
                        the Indians, and the White People were placed<br/> beyond the great water -
                        when the white Men<br/> first came to this Land, the wise old Men<br/> among
                        the Indians, told their People, that if<br/> they received anything of the
                        white Men, they<br/> would be destroyed,­ "the bitter Water was made<br/>
                        for white folks, but the Water of the Brooks and<br/> Rivers for, the
                        Indians</said>, - but not regarding<br/> this advice, many of the Nations
                    Traded with<br/> the Whites, took their Hatchets, Knives and<br/> Rum, and gave
                    up their Land for trifles,<br/> and, according to the ancient prediction,
                    they<br/> have wasted away, and some of them -<br/> become quite extinct, and
                    the few that<br/> are remaining are driven, almost to<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_46" n="46"></pb> to where the sun sets, but they are
                    now<br/> determined to be driven no further, should<br/> they go to where the
                    Sun sets, they would<br/> all be lost forever. - The Congress must<br/> remove
                    their Forts, and all their People over<br/> the River, and then the Indians will
                    take<br/> them by the hand, and become their true<br/> friends - but should the
                    Commissioners<br/> meet the Indians in Council, and there<br/> pretend that they
                    have conquered their<br/> Country, and will not remove out of it, in<br/> that
                    case, the Indians will withdraw from<br/> the Council, and then, instantly, fall
                    upon<br/> the opposite party, and destroy them all -<br/> this is the substance
                    of what he said as<br/> intrepretted by <a href="/people/sash1">Sylvester

                    remarks, the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawen-ese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> Warriour
                    abovementioned return'd to our<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_47" n="47"></pb> our Lodgings, being in Liquor, he
                    desired<br/> to enquire of the Landlord whither<br/> he could tarry in hie House
                    all Night, but<br/> being told that it was contrary to the regulations<br/> of
                    the Garrison, he seemed to be displeased, and<br/> ask'd for his Tomahawk, which
                        <a href="/people/sash1">Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a> had in<br/> keeping, and going up
                    stairs to get it, the<br/> Indian followed him, and on receiving it,<br/> said
                    he was Drunk, and did not know what<br/> might happen before Night - then
                    lifting<br/> his Tomahawk, attempted to strike <a href="/people/sash1">Ash<persname key="sash1"></persname></a>,<br/> who being upon his guard, seized his arm<br/> and
                    pushed him down Stairs - he then<br/> went up to <a href="/people/mdols1">M.
                        Dolsen<persname key="mdols1"></persname></a>, knock'd off his Hat,<br/> and in the Indian tongue, bid
                    him be<br/> Strong, and see if he could turn him<br/> out, and made a stroke, in
                    which the<br/> Hatchet flew off the halve. - <a href="/people/mdols1">Dolsen<persname key="mdols1"></persname></a> im-<br/>-mediately seized him, turned him out of<br/> the
                    House, and bruized him pretty much,<br/> the Indian seeing his blood run,
                    and<br/> having recovered his Tomahawk, flourished<br/> it about in a great
                    rage, and in all<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_48" n="48"></pb> probability, had not <a href="/people/cmons1">Capt. Munsey<persname key="cmons1"></persname></a>, an<br/> officer of the Garrison, been

                    captain took away his Tomahawk,<br/> and sent for a Guard, who turn'd him

                    it with them; whose business it was, to<br/> determine as they might think
                    proper<br/> - said he had heard we were in Detroit,<br/> and having some
                    business this way, came<br/> to see us, but had nothing to say on Public<br/>
                    matters - he had often heard of Quakers, he<br/> said, but had never seen any of
                    them be-<br/>fore, and, expressing his regard for them,<br/> and satisfaction
                    with the Visit, took his<br/> leave. - Friends had a desire to be more<br/>
                    particular with him, in regard to the Objects<br/> which induced them to take
                    this long Jour-<br/>ney, but the Interpretter not seeming to<br/> be disposed to
                    gratify them in that respect,<br/> they were constrained, after expressing a
                    little<br/> of their desires for the Peace and wellfare of <del>man kin</del><br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_51" n="51"></pb> mankind, to be silent. - <a href="/people/bljac1">Blue Jacket<persname key="bljac1"></persname></a><br/> said that should the Commissioners
                    &amp; Indians<br/> meet at a Treaty, and matters like to be ac-<br/>-commodated,
                    it was his opinion it would<br/> be two Months before the business would be<br/>
                    compleated. - this day sail'd the Schooner<br/> Nancy for <a href="/places/ferie">Fort Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, a Merchant Vessell, with<br/> a Cargo of Peltry, and
                    Indian-made Maple-<br/> Sugar, by this it may appear, that a greater<br/>
                    quantity of Sugar is procured from the Indians<br/> than is consumed in this
                    part of the Country,<br/>how much lower down, the Country
                        <del>is</del><br/><del><gap></gap></del> is <del>not</del> supplied <del>in</del>
                    the same way,<br/> is what I cannot determine, but from the<br/> best
                    information, I am ready to think, that<br/> very little foreign Sugar, if any,
                        <del>if any foreign sugar</del> (except refined)<br/> is consumed in Upper
                    Canada.</p>

<p> Brothers,<br/>We who send you this Letter<br/> are of the People called
                            Quakers, and have<br/> left our homes and families in Pensylvania<br/>
                            and New Jersey, and taken this long Journey<br/> to see you purely from
                            motives of Love and<br/> good will, and to endeavour to promote<br/>
                            peace.- We have been now five weeks at<br/> Detroit waiting for the
                            opening of the Treaty<br/> at <a href="/places/sandu">Sandusky<placename key="sandu"></placename></a>, where we expected to have seen<br/> you all,

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_57" n="57"></pb> they may come no farther.</p>
<p> Brothers, We have brought with us an<br/> address to you from our
                            Brethren at home<br/> which we are very desirous of presenting to<br/>
                            you with our own hands, if an opportunity<br/> can be had. - it is also
                            in our hearts to<br/> acquaint you that we consider all Men<br/> as the
                            Children of one common Father, and<br/> think it our duty to Love all as
                            Brothers.<br/> -We believe it displeases the Great and Good<br/> Spirit
                            when Men injure and kill one<br/> another, therefore we endeavour to do
                            Justice,<br/> but when any dispute arises, we leave it<br/> to be
                            settled by disinterested and impartial<br/> persons, and never go to war
                            on any-<br/> occasion.- We have been made very<br/> sorrowful on account
                            of the War and bloodshed<br/> between the United States and our
                            Indian<br/> Brethren, and want much to see you<br/> that we may open our
                            Hearts more<br/> fully than we can do by writing, for we<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_58" n="58"></pb> are fully convinced that by
                            looking up<br/> to the Great Spirit for Counsel, all differences<br/>
                            may be settled without fighting and killing<br/> one another, which we
                            think is very<br/> Cruel and attended with many distressing<br/>
                            circumstances both to you and the White People.</p>
<p> Our society have experienced for more<br/> than one hundred years great
                            advantage<br/> and satisfaction in living Peaceably with<br/> all Men,
                            and are very desirous that you<br/> may enjoy the same benefits, and to
                            that<br/> end were made willing to expose ourselves,<br/> encounter
                            hardships, and spend our sub-<br/>stance to promote Peace and Love
                            between<br/> you and the Government of the United<br/> States.- We pray
                            the Good Spirit<br/> that He may put an end to the ravages<br/> of War
                            and unite all Men as Brethren,<br/> that by being bound together in one
                            great<br/> Chain of Love and friendship which <del>can</del><br/> cannot
                            be broken, we may all seek the<br/> happiness of each other in this

<p> Some of our Friends had an interview<br/> with a Person of the Name of Wilbank,
                    who-<br/> within a few days past arrived, with a Party<br/> of 26 Southern
                    Indians, from the back parts of<br/> the Carolina's and Georgia, at the Great
                    Council<br/> at the Miami, - he came from thence to this<br/> place, and a
                    Vessel is to be dispatched immediately<br/> to carry him down to <a href="/people/gsimc1">Governor Simcoe<persname key="gsimc1"></persname></a>. He says,<br/> that the Indians have
                    in several instances<br/> been grossly imposed upon, particularly by<br/>
<a href="/people/gblou1">Governor Blount<persname key="gblou1"></persname></a>, who by bribing an
                    Interpreter<br/> had cheated them out of a great extent of<br/> Country, and
                    defrauded them of one half<br/> the Sum, agreed upon to be paid yearly, as<br/>
                    as a compensation for the Land granted,-<br/> in one instance where they had
                    agreed to<br/> sell 50 miles square they had fraudulently<br/> put in the Deed
                    80 miles - and where they had<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_60" n="60"></pb> had bargained for an extent of 10
                    miles<br/> round the Town of Nashville, <a href="/people/gblou1">Governor
                        Blount<persname key="gblou1"></persname></a><br/> had caused 40 miles to be inserted.- and instead<br/>
                    of a Consideration of 2000 Dollars yearly, he had<br/> put down but 1000
                    dollars.- This being but<br/> one side of the question, we do not pretend
                    to<br/> Judge, but it is the received opinion here, that<br/> their errand to
                    the Council is, to form a Union<br/> with the Northern Indians, and make
                    One<br/> common cause, either in forming a Treaty,<br/> or carrying on a War. -
                    The Vessell (the Felicity) to Carry<br/> Wilbank to <a href="/places/ferie">Fort
                        Erie<placename key="ferie"></placename></a>, sail'd about 2 oClock:-<br/> - Yesterday a young Man going
                    out to look<br/> for Horses, got lost in the Woods, which are very<br/> thick
                    within less than a Mile of the Fort.-<br/> several 18 pounders were fired in the
                    afternoon<br/> in order to direct him in finding the way back,<br/> which, I
                    suppose had the desired effect, as I am<br/> informed he got safe home in the
                    Evening -<br/>- several instances of the kind have before<br/> occurred, and
                    sometimes the persons lost have<br/> never returned. - It is said some little
                    time<br/> past, two Indians were kill'd by the Wolves<br/> in the Neighbourhood
                    of this place.</p>

<p> The Wind which for many days past<br/> has been from the S.W.and
                    consequently<br/> unfavourable for coming up the Lake, yesterday<br/> and today
                    has blown from the N.E., so that<br/> we are now hourly in hopes of having<br/>
                    intelligence from below, which we expect<br/> will cause our immediate removal
                    from<br/> this place</p>

<p> Being First Day, a Meeting was<br/> held at 10 oClock in the Sail Loft and<br/>
                    another at the same place at 5 in the<br/> afternoon, both satisfactory.</p>
<p> About Noon arrived <a href="/people/lgive1">Lieut. Givens<persname key="lgive1"></persname></a>
<del>Gibbons</del> of<br/> the Queens Rangers, who brought the agree<br/>able
                    intelligence that the Dunmore, with<br/> the Commissioners on Board had arrived
                    at<br/> the mouth of the River. - About 5 oClock,<br/> (having Landed the
                    Commissioners) the<br/> Dunmore came up to the wharf, - in<br/> the evening had
                    a Visit from <a href="/people/lgive1">Lt. Givens<persname key="lgive1"></persname></a>
<del>Gibbons</del>,<br/> by him we are informed that the Com-<br/>missioners are
                    come forward with a<br/> full expectation of a Treaty, very speedily,<br/> being
                    held. - He says the Deputation from<br/> the Indians, who had a conference
                    with<br/> the Commissioners in the presence of <a href="/people/gsimc1">Govnr. Simcoe<persname key="gsimc1"></persname></a>, to all appearance, return'd well<br/>
                    satisfied, and that in his opinion there<br/> is a great probability of <del>an
                        accomodation</del> matters being<br/> accomodated. - That the main
                    business<br/> of the Indian Deputies was to enquire, in<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_63" n="63"></pb> in the first place, whither the
                    Com-<br/>-missioners were properly authorized to<br/> treat, and secondly,
                    whither they had<br/> power to recede from the boundary-<br/><del>Line</del> now
                    claimed by the United States,<br/> and being satisfied in both these
                    points,<br/> they took the Commissioners by the hand, and<br/> presenting them
                    with a Belt of white Wamp<br/>-um, invited them to come forward to the<br/>
                    Treaty. - We are informed by <a href="/people/cford1">Captain Ford<persname key="cford1"></persname></a>
                    that he has orders to attend upon the<br/> Commissioners with his Vessell, and
                    expects<br/> to be ready to proceed to the Mouth of<br/> the River in a Day or
                    two.</p>

<p> We were busy in settling our little<br/> concerns, and preparing to leave
                        <a href="/places/detro">Detroit<placename key="detro"></placename></a>,<br/>
<del>ware</del> where we have experienced many marks<br/> of polite attention,

                    what<br/> some of us expected or even flatter'd ourselves<br/> was our due. -
                    Our way hitherto, in every<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_64" n="64"></pb> every sense, has been made pleasant<br/>
                    beyond what could have been foreseen,<br/> or reasonably expected, - for this
                    great<br/> favour, thanksgiving and praises are<br/> due to the Great Author of
                    every good</p>
<p> --The kind attention which, <emph rend="underline">unrecom-</emph><br/><emph rend="underline">mended</emph>, we have received from Strangers, I<br/>
                    hope, will ever be kept in grateful re-<br/>membrance, and I cannot but
                    conclude,<br/> the obligation is greatly enhanced by the<br/> persuasion, that
                    it proceeded not from<br/> sinester motives, but was simply<br/> the effusion of
                    noble and generous Minds.</p>

                    private consul-<br/>tation, <a href="/people/glinc1">Genl. Lincoln<persname key="glinc1"></persname></a>, in

<p> The Indians came over about 10 oClock, but<br/> were informed that an answer
                    would not be ready<br/> for them before 5 in the afternoon,- about<br/> that
                    time the Deputies assembled, and <a href="/people/cpick1">Col.
                        Pickering<persname key="cpick1"></persname></a>, in behalf of the Commissioners, ap<br/> -pologized for
                    making them wait so long for<br/> an answer.- He then according to the<br/>
                    Indian custom, repeated over the Contents of<br/> the written message brought
                    from the Council<br/> at the Miami, and proceed to read a very<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_72" n="72"></pb> lengthy answer, which in the first
                    place<br/> pointed out the improbability of any part of<br/> the business being
                    misunderstood at the conference<br/> at <a href="/places/fniag">Niagara<placename key="fniag"></placename></a>, and stated such facts as made<br/> it appear that such
                    a pretence could be<br/> nothing less than want of sincerity.-
                    <del>men</del><br/> -mention was then made of the several<br/> Treaties
                    concluded since the establishment<br/> of the Independance of the United States,
                    and<br/> of the new settlements made in consequence<br/> of those treaties, and
                    of the impossibility of<br/> removing such a great number of Families<br/> from
                    their habitations and Farms; and<br/> therefore, in the most explicit terms
                        <del>de-</del><br/><del>clared</del> declared that the United States
                    could<br/> not agree that the<geogname key="ohior"> River Ohio</geogname> should
                    be<br/> the boundary line.- In the next place<br/> the Commissioners
                    acknowledged that very<br/> improper Language had been held out at<br/> former
                    Treaties, when it had been said that<br/> the United States claimed all the
                    Indian Coun<br/>-try, (within certain limits mark'd out by<br/> the Treaty of
                    Peace with the British) as a con-<br/>quer'd Country.- The Commissioners<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_73" n="73"></pb> therefore, in the clearest terms, now
                    relin-<br/>-quishd all such claim, reserving only the<br/> preemption, or
                    exclusive right of purchasing<br/> of the Indians.- The Commissioners then<br/>
                    express'd their desires to meet the Indians in<br/> full Council, and a belief
                    that if such <del><gap></gap></del><br/><del><unclear>work</unclear></del> a thing
                    could be done, and a friendly<br/> conference take place, a satisfactory and
                    lasting<br/> Peace would be the consequence - They<br/> concluded with
                    intimating that for the<br/> sake of an accommodation they would be<br/> willing
                    to give up all the Land to the N.W. of the<br/>
<geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>, excepting such only as were
                    absolutely~<br/> appropriated, and, for such as were appropri-<br/>-ated, a
                    generous compensation should be<br/> paid down, and a yearly Rent allowed<br/>
                    forever.- The answer was interpretted<br/> paragraphically as it was read, and
                    then<br/> the whole writing given to the Indians.</p>
<p> -The old Wiandot Chief who delivered the<br/> message yesterday, got up and
                    said, as the<br/>sun was going down they would consider of what was said by<br/>
                    the Commissioners <del>answer</del> and speak a few<br/> words to them in the
                    Morning.</p>

<p> - The Indians came over about<br/> 7 oClock in the morning, and having met
                    the<br/> Commissioners in Council - the old Chief<br/> who spoke last night
                    arose, and said, they<br/> perfectly understood all that was said to them<br/>
                    yesterday, and had only to say, that in<br/> regard to the several Treaties
                    mentioned<br/> yesterday, they did not acknowledge any of<br/> them to be valid,
                    and as the Commissioners<br/> had said they could not remove the white<br/>
                    People over the River, so they, the Indians,<br/> could not consent to give up
                    any of their<br/> Country, and concluded with saying,<br/> they came as Men
                    wishing for Peace,<br/> but as that could not be obtained, they<br/> should
                    return to their Council, and speak<br/> to their warriors:- And as for the
                    Commissioners.<br/> they <del>the Indians</del> had nothing more to say to<br/>
                    them, they might go home, and tell <del>the</del><br/><del>President</del>
                    Washington what the Indians had said.-</p>
<p> -After the Indians had retired a few minutes,<br/>
<a href="/people/sgirt1">Simon Girty<persname key="sgirt1"></persname></a> their interpretter, and several
                    of<br/> their Chiefs, came back, and said, there had<br/> been a mistake in the
                    last part of the -<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_75" n="75"></pb> speech - that the business of the
                    Deputies<br/> was to carry the Commissioners answer to the<br/> Great Council,
                    and they desired the Comissnrs.<br/> would wait a few days for a final
                    answer.</p>
<p> -The Indians then immediately took their<br/> leave, and <a href="/people/tmcke1">Thos. McKee<persname key="tmcke1"></persname></a>, about 11 oClock also<br/> set off for the <geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname>, and as the prospect of meeting<br/> the
                    Indians at a general Treaty now<br/> appears very faint, Friends concluded to
                    forward<br/> the address to the Indians, agreed upon the <date when="1793-07-17">17th</date> ulto. <del><unclear>ultimus</unclear></del><br/> by him, under

                    Custom formerly among these barbarous<br/> Nations to put all their prisoners to
                    Death,<br/> but since their acquaintance with the<br/> White People these

                    this day<br/> Dined with the Commissioners, and confirm'd<br/> what was noted as
                    coming from him on the<br/>
<date when="1793-07-18">18th of last month</date>, and gave a more full

<p> In the forepart of last night had a<br/> sudden and heavy fall of rain which
                    made<br/> our Tents very uncomfortable for the remainder<br/> of the night.- The
                    Commissioners growing<br/> impatient at the delay of the Indians, sent<br/> off
                    an Express to the Council in order<br/> to hasten their answer.</p>

<p> Two Wiandots from the other side inform<br/> us that an Indian from the Council
                    arrived<br/> last night at their Village with intelligence that<br/> there had
                    been great debates among them <del>res</del><br/> respecting the answer to be
                    return'd to the<br/> Commissioners The <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnese<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, <br/>
<a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wiandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>'s being for war, and<br/> the Six Nations, on the Contrary,
                    peacably inclined,<br/> that finally the Six Nations had prevail'd and<br/>
                    messangers were to be dispatched three Nights<br/> ago with a favourable answer,
                    and an invitation<br/> for the Commissioners to come forward.- One of<br/> the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wiandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> abovementioned was a White
                    Man<br/> taken by the Indians in his infancy, he cannot<br/> speak a word of
                    English, <del>he can give no</del> or give any account<br/> of his Family; and
                    only remembers that his<br/> Name was Honnes - His Ears were cut, and<br/>
                    himself, in all respects, dress'd &amp; ornamented<br/> in the Indian stile -
                    dullness and stupidity<br/> seemed to be spread over his Countenance, and<br/>
                    his whole appearance could not but raise<br/> emotions of sorrow and
                    commiseration.</p>

<p> About 4 P.M. the long look-for answer<br/> arrived which at once put an end to all<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_82" n="82"></pb> to all hopes of a Peace at present -
                    the<br/> substance of this lengthy reply, which fill'd<br/> near two sheets of
                    Paper was, that no consi-<br/>-deration would induce the Indians to<br/> give up
                    their Country, and nothing short<br/> of making the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> the boundary could give<br/> them satisfaction, and if the
                    Commissioners<br/> could not agree to this there would be no use<br/> in meeting
                    at a Treaty - The answer was<br/> signed, it is said, by sixteen Nations,
                    being<br/> all that were present except the Six<br/> Nations, who all refused
                    their concurrence<br/> and are favourably disposed towards the<br/> United
                    States.- About 8 P.M. the two<br/> young <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondaga<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>'s return'd who were<br/> sent express by the
                    Commissioners, as<br/> mentioned the <date when="1793-08-14">14th</date>, they
                    brought no<br/> written reply, and could give very little in-<br/>formation,
                    except that they delivered their<br/> message to <a href="/people/cbran1">Capt.
                        Brandt<persname key="cbran1"></persname></a> the <a href="/organizations/mohawk">Mohawk<orgname key="mohawk"></orgname></a> Chief,<br/> who
                    informed that an answer to the Commissnr.<br/> Speech was already gone down, the purport<br/>
<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_83" n="83"></pb> of which he was intirely unacquainted
                    with,<br/> as he, with the rest of the Six Nations, were<br/> not admitted into
                    the Council - Thus ends<br/> a business in which, it is too probable, the
                    fate<br/> of thousands are involved, - should there be<br/> any, who from
                    interested motives, or mis-<br/>-taken policy, have endeavoured to retard<br/>
                    the work of Peace, and promote the horrid<br/> consequences attendant upon War,
                    what<br/> will they not have to answer for!</p>

                    left our Boat and<br/>made up a fire on this Shore, and<br/>spent a very

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_92" n="92"></pb> and emigrants from different

                    the S.E. side appeared more<br/>pleasant, and better cultivated. -
                    The<br/>Country on both sides the River, below<br/>the Lake, is thickly

                    remarkable, in one of<br/>which we went 3 Leagues in 35 minutes<br/> and

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_94" n="94"></pb> - after dining at <a href="/places/montr">Montreal<placename key="montr"></placename></a> we cross'd<br/>the River at Longuiel Ferry,

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_95" n="95"></pb> Calm, got only 5 miles on our way,

                    coming fair<br/>about 11 oClock we got up the Lake to where<br/>the boundary
                    Line intersects it in 45° of<br/> N. Lattitude, - the Country on the East

                    on both sides of the Line, - on the<br/>West side also are many settlements,
                    but<br/>not so flourishing as on the East. - about<br/>One oClock pass'd the

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_96" n="96"></pb>
<p>-- at 4 P.M. we arrived at Cumberland<br/>head in the State of New York, where
                    a<br/> Custom House is established, here also,<br/>our little Vessell underwent
                    another <del>exa</del><br/> examination.- Our Skipper being<br/>very ill with

                    or 15 Years of Age, as a Pilot.<br/> - the wind being fair and blowing
                    very<br/>fresh we were loth to loose it, &amp; ventured<br/>to push on, being
                    told we could make<br/>a harbour at Gillilands Creek about 20<br/>miles further
                    up the Lake, at which<br/>place we arrived about 8 in the evening,<br/>but in

<pb facs="SW_WH1793_Page_97" n="97"></pb> liking to trust any longer to our pilot,
                    we<br/>came to an Anchor, pretty much exposed<br/>to the Wind and Sea, and

<p>It is a matter of perfect indifference whither<br/>the Potatoes employed as Sets,
                    be whole or cut<br/>in pieces; but that a variation in the<br/>size of the Sets
                    planted, always affects<br/>the amount of the Crop in a very remark-<br/>able
                    degree, the largest sets in all Cases<br/>producing the greatest Crops<br/>
