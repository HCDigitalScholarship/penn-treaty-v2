<p> Isaac was the son of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/scoat1">Samuel Coates<persname key="scoat1"></persname></a>, of East

                    the <br/>Pennsylvania Railroad. It was from here, presuma-<br/>bly, that he set
                    off on the journey described below. <br/>He was a member of Caln Meeting, and is
                    buried in <br/>that burying-ground. Among his children was <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lcoat1">Lind- ley Coates<persname key="lcoat1"></persname></a>, a prominent and esteemed

<p> after a <br/>solid time in my family I left home on my journey <br/>into the

<p> Rode over and through the gap in several <br/>mountains, past a furnace known by
                    the name of <br/>Kittera's. The precipices on both right and left of <br/>one of
                    them exhibited a magnificent appearance. <br/>After which we entered a limestone
                    valley of good <br/>land, though not improved, as I apprehended, in the
                    <br/>best manner. Fed our horses at the stone tavern, <br/>sixteen miles; [then]
                    to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/shipp">Shippensburg<placename key="shipp"></placename></a> twelve and <br/>one-half
                    miles, part of which, notwithstanding it was <br/>in the valley, appeared to be
                    very poor, covered with <br/>pine of small growth and barren oaks. A few miles
                    <br/>before we reached <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/shipp">Shippensburg<placename key="shipp"></placename></a> we passed
                    through <br/>some excellent wheat land, being covered with black <br/>oak and
                    hickory. Dined at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/shipp">Shippensburg<placename key="shipp"></placename></a>. The
                    gen-<br/>eral part of the corn thus far very poor; buckwheat, <br/>in some
                    place, pretty good. Then proceeded to a <br/>small village called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/stras">Strasburg<placename key="stras"></placename></a>, ten miles; through <br/>tolerable land
                    but no water which I thought fit to <br/>drink for myself or horse for twenty
                    miles. Then <br/>ascended the mountain called the Blue Ridge, the <br/>ascent
                    and descent of which is three miles, affording <br/>a prospect which shows the
                    wonderful works of the <br/>Author of Nature. Crossed a branch of the <geogname key="conod">Conodo-<br/>guinet</geogname> running to the right, and lodged
                    at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jskin1">Skinner's<persname key="jskin1"></persname></a>
<br/>in <geogname key="horsv">Horse Valley</geogname>. This day's ride,
                    forty-one and a<br/> half miles.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1799-08-28">28th.</date>
<placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> In the morning, ascended and descended <br/>two large mountains, the valley
                    between them called <br/><geogname key="pathv">Path Valley</geogname>, in which
                    is a small village called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ferri">Ferris-burg<placename key="ferri"></placename></a>;
                    it being seven miles across those two moun-<br/>tains. In the aforesaid valley
                    is a fine stream run-<br/>ning to the right, called <geogname key="conoc">Conogocheak [Conoco-<br/>cheague]</geogname>; and a pretty good settlement.
                    After <br/>crossing the mountains, very poor broken land thinly <br/>inhabited,
                    to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/flitt">Fort Littleton<placename key="flitt"></placename></a>, twelve miles from
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jskin1">Skinner's<persname key="jskin1"></persname></a>; here we breakfasted. In
                    crossing those <br/>mountains and valleys my mind was much em-<br/>ployed in
                    contemplating the wonderful works of an <br/>all-wise Creator.</p>
<p> To <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jskin1">John Skinner's<persname key="jskin1"></persname></a> on the top of <geogname key="sidel">Sidling Hill</geogname>, <br/>eleven miles, being a tremendous
                    mountain, on the <br/>ridge of which we rode about four miles; at the end
                    <br/>thereof, and descending the mountain, a grand pros-<br/>pect opened of the
                        <geogname key="allmo">Allegheny Mountain</geogname> and what<br/> appeared a
                    tolerably level valley, considerably im-<br/>proved with plantations; but in
                    riding through it we <br/>found it to be very hilly, approached to mountains;
                    <br/>then crossed a branch of <geogname key="junia">Juniata</geogname>, running
                    to the <br/>right, and rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hart1">Hartley's<persname key="hart1"></persname></a>, where
                    we expect to lodge. <br/>The river was frequently on our right hand and
                    fre-<br/>quently near our left hand, and we on an eminence <br/>perhaps of one
                    or two hundred feet, some place ap-<br/>proaching near perpendicular. This day's
                    ride, thir-<br/>ty-nine miles.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1799-08-29">29th.</date>
<placename key="berli"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode up the valley through some tolerably <br/>good limestone land to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bedfo">Bedford<placename key="bedfo"></placename></a>, six miles; crossed two <br/>branches of the
                    aforesaid water. After leaving <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bedfo">Bed-ford<placename key="bedfo"></placename></a>
                    passed through a gap in <geogname key="wilmo">Wills' Mountain</geogname> and
                    <br/>over <geogname key="junia">Juniata</geogname> again. Here is some of the
                    best land <br/>and the best improved I have yet seen amongst those
                    <br/>mountains. To our right to Stotler on the ridge, in <br/>divers places was
                    oats growing of a good length; some <br/>ripe, some almost ripe, and some
                    standing in shock. <br/>From thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/berli">Berlin<placename key="berli"></placename></a>, thirteen miles. On our way <br/>we met an old man who had
                    just killed a large buck <br/>which had horns with a number of prongs, covered
                    <br/>with the velvet, which he had skinned and had some <br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_02" n="453"></pb> of the meat tied up in it carrying about
                    his neck in <br/>the manner of a knapsack. In riding six miles we <br/>came to
                    the foot of the great <geogname key="allmo">Allegheny mountains</geogname>
<br/>where is some good land; buckwheat and oats about <br/>of an equal
                    ripeness, both good, but the buckwheat <br/>extraordinary; as much so as I think
                    I have ever <br/>seen. The ascent of this mountain better land than <br/>any of
                    the others, being covered with lofty timber of <br/>divers sorts, and on the top
                    of said mountain got some <br/>excellent water, being the first I have met with
                    since <br/>I left home. After we got over the mountains the <br/>timber was very
                    thick but much destroyed with fire. <br/>Two or three miles before we came to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/berli">Berlin<placename key="berli"></placename></a> the land <br/>appeared to be
                    excellent, covered with heavy timber, <br/>black oak, white oak, red oak,
                    hickory, and sugar <br/>maple, grass and other vegetables very flourishing, it
                    <br/>having been a wet growing season. This day's ride, <br/>thirty-six
                    miles.</p>

<placename key="conne1"></placename></dateline>
<p> Took an early set-off from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/berli">Berlin<placename key="berli"></placename></a>, being a
                    <br/>village of about 50 houses; passed through some very <br/>rough lands and
                    roads on which I saw a rattlesnake <br/>about three feet long with ten rattles,
                    lying in the <br/>road, appearing to have been just killed by a wagon-<br/>wheel
                    running over it. Part of the way to this stage <br/>the land was covered with
                    most beautiful lofty chest-<br/>nuts, and part of the way very thick set with
                    white <br/>pine, being thirteen miles; [reached] a Dutch tavern <br/>where we
                    thought best to breakfast on our own choco-<br/>late. From thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gbach1">George Bachelor's<persname key="gbach1"></persname></a>, fourteen <br/>miles in which we
                    crossed what is called <geogname key="laure">Laurel Hill</geogname>, <br/>being
                    one mountain after another for seven or eight <br/>miles of the way. The ascent
                    of one of them ex-<br/>ceeded all for chestnut timber I ever saw; they stand
                    <br/>so thick together and are so tall that I fully believe <br/>there are
                    thousands of acres that would yield more <br/>than 10,000 rails to the acre.
                    Almost all those moun-<br/>tains that go by the aforesaid name are the most
                    fer-<br/>tile of any I have yet seen; the trees and vegetables <br/>of every
                    kind are so luxuriant I could not help feel-<br/>ing some attachment to the
                    place; but when I con-<br/>sidered the exceeding rough mountainous face of the
                    <br/>surface and the intolerable road to and from the <br/>place, I am content
                    if I should live to return to spend <br/>the remainder of my days in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/chest1">Chester County<placename key="chest1"></placename></a>. Pro-<br/>ceeded to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/conne1">Connelstown<placename key="conne1"></placename></a>, being a new settled place of
                    <br/>about fifty houses on the <geogname key="yough">Yoghagena [Youghiogheny]
                        <br/>river</geogname>. Lodged with our old friends, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tgibs1">Thomas<persname key="tgibs1"></persname></a> and <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jgibs1">Joshua Gibson<persname key="jgibs1"></persname></a>,
                    sixteen miles. Nothing very remark-<br/>able the last stage, except in one place
                    about six miles <br/>back, we rose to or on an eminence where a grand
                    <br/>prospect opened to view, to the east, the north, and <br/>the west,
                    particularly to the west where we could see <br/>as far as the eye could reach-I
                    suppose as far as the <br/><geogname key="ohior">Ohio river</geogname>. Here on
                    the <geogname key="yough">Yoghagena river</geogname> the people <br/>were
                    employed in building flat-bottomed boats, the <br/>stern of which they cover
                    with thin boards for a <br/>shelter. Some of them are thirty, some forty, and
                    <br/>some fifty feet long and twelve wide, in which they <br/>will carry 360
                    barrels of flour or iron or other pro-<br/>duce in proportion, to Kentucky or
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newor">New Orleans<placename key="newor"></placename></a>.</p>

<p> Crossed the <geogname key="yough">Yoghogany</geogname>, being a small river,
                    <br/>perhaps hal fas large as <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> above
                    the Falls. <br/>About a mile from said river as we rode up a small <br/>stream
                    large enough to turn a mill, we came to a curi-<br/>ous limestone rock lying
                    horizontal, about three feet <br/>thick, forming a concave semi-circle of
                    perhaps 300 <br/>feet, near the centre of which the water fell about <br/>
                    twenty-eight feet there being a walk on another rock <br/>about twelve feet
                    below the other, and near the same <br/>distance deep back behind the water
                    where we might <br/>safely walk. Just at one side and near the centre of<br/>the
                    semi-circle a spacious grist mill is built butting up <br/>against the rock.
                    Then passed over many hills and <br/>valleys to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/rcadw1">Reese
                        Cadwallader,s<persname key="rcadw1"></persname></a>, twenty miles. Passed <br/>a new paper-mill
                    occupied by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar3">Jonathan Sharpless<persname key="jshar3"></persname></a>, on
                        <br/><geogname key="redst">Redstone creek</geogname>; also <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sjack1">Samuel Jackson's<persname key="sjack1"></persname></a> grist mill at <br/>the mouth of
                    said creek, over which there is a large <br/>bridge, near thirty feet high, wide
                    enough for a wagon <br/>to cross. We were expecting to find a road in
                    pro-<br/>portion; but immediately after getting over we found <br/>ourselves on
                    a narrow path perhaps not more than <br/>five feet wide, and a precipice on our
                    left hand down to <br/>
<geogname key="redst">Redstone creek</geogname>, and on our right hand down to
                    <br/>the <geogname key="monon">Monongahela river</geogname>, each of them near
                    perpen-<br/>dicular, which was near 200 feet, which to some of <br/>our company
                    was truly alarming; and I believe <br/>would have been more so had it not been
                    that a <br/>bulky woman rode on just before us seemingly with-<br/>out care or
                    fear. Then rode up the last mentioned <br/>river through a beautiful town on the
                    bank of the <br/>same, perhaps of forty or fifty houses. This river I <br/>think
                    is larger than <geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname>, running to the
                    right. <br/>The land thus far through the Redstone settlement is <br/>very rough
                    and mountainous, and appears to be very <br/>fertile, producing wheat, rye,
                    oats, buckwheat, and <br/>grass in abundance even on the top of the hills, and
                    <br/>abundance of lofty timber of many sorts, particularly <br/>sugar maple and
                    white oak. But notwithstanding it <br/>hath been a very wet growing season and
                    all kinds of <br/>grain in the ground and vegetables look luxuriant, <br/>yet
                    the waters are very low, which induces me to <br/>believe that, when the land
                    comes to be more gener-<br/>ally cleared and a dry season takes place (which I
                    <br/>suppose frequently does), the inhabitants will suffer <br/>from lack of
                    water. The reason in part as I take it, <br/>of the water's failing so much is a
                    horizontal rock <br/>which lies a little underground, I believe, over much
                    <br/>of the country.</p>

                    in <br/>low or straightened circumstances, that now appeared <br/>to live in
                    fullness and plenty; many of whom I hope <br/>are in a good measure thankful to

                    ex-<br/>ceeding kind, and seemed as if they thought they <br/>could hardly do
                    enough for us. Got well equipped by <br/>them for our journey and set off soon
                    after dinner. <br/>Crossed the beautiful <geogname key="monon">river
                        Monongahela</geogname> and rode <br/>eleven miles to one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gray1">Graybil's<persname key="gray1"></persname></a>, where we lodged. The <br/>most of the way
                    tolerable; good land though moun-<br/> tainous and not equal ot Redstone land
                    for fertility. <br/>About ten miles from the river, on our way we <br/>crossed a
                    considerable stream called <geogname key="pigeo">Pidgeon's creek</geogname>,
                    <br/>running to the right.</p>

<p> Rode eight miles to one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/barc1">Barclay's<persname key="barc1"></persname></a>, got
                    break-<br/>fast. Nothing very remarkable occurred on our way <br/>this stage,
                    except as we rode a considerable way up a <br/>branch of <geogname key="mancr">Mango creek</geogname>, in divers places the water <br/>fell off a smooth,
                    horizontal rock, some place four, <br/>some six, and some more feet; and up this
                    narrow <br/>valley the greatest quantity of sugar maple with <br/>troughs for
                    collecting sap appeared, of any place <br/>I have yet seen, though they abound
                    through the <br/>country in such plenty that I think if the inhabitants <br/>are
                    careful, and frugal they need never import the <br/>luxury of sugar. Even if
                    other timber should fail <br/>for firing, the stone-coal is plenty in these
                    parts; <br/>[rode] from thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>,
                    fifteen miles. About <br/>one mile from Barclay's is a sawmill occupied and
                    <br/>owned by one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/bald1">Baldwin<persname key="bald1"></persname></a> who removed from
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newli">Newlin<placename key="newli"></placename></a>, a Friendly man; which I
                    though might be <br/>good quarters if I should ever travel this road again.
                    <br/>No great variations in the land except gradually de-<br/>clining towards
                    poor land. When we arrived on the <br/>top of the mountain, where we got the
                    first sight of <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>, we soon began
                    to descend the steepest hill <br/>I ever saw a wagon road upon, which to me
                    appeared <br/>almost impraticable for a good team to draw an <br/>empty wagon
                    up. Nevertheless the inhabitants say <br/> they frequently go up loaded. When we
                    descended <br/>to the bottom we again crossed the beautiful <geogname key="monon">Monon-<br/>gahela</geogname> and immediately entered the town
                    where we<br/> stayed the afternoon in providing some necessaries, <br/>in which
                    I took the opportunity to walk down to the <br/>point or junction of the
                    aforesaid river and the <geogname key="alleg">Alle-<br/>gheny</geogname>, which
                    makes the great and grander <geogname key="ohior">River Ohio</geogname>, <br/>it
                    being a delightful prospect. Also had a view of <br/>the remains of the old
                    French <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/fduqu">Fort Duquesne<placename key="fduqu"></placename></a> and the <br/>English
                    fort, which are both very much demolished <br/>and beautiful grass-lots in their
                    place. This town <br/>appears to be a lively place of trade containing
                    per-<br/>haps 200 houses.</p>

                    <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Set off early from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/pitts">Pitts-burg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a> and
                    immediately crossed the <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny river</geogname>, a
                    <br/>beautiful stream about a quarter of a mile wide. For <br/>about two or
                    three miles after crossing, we rode <br/>through the richest piece of land I
                    think I ever be-<br/>held, for so much. The stately walnuts [were] four
                    <br/>feet through, and a great length, and other timber in <br/>proportion,
                    every herb and plant appearing as luxu-<br/>riant as if it had grown out of a
                    dung heap. Soon <br/>after that, a declension of soil took place and
                    pro-<br/>gressed until it became, as I thought, very poor, <br/>rough, and
                    hilly, until we came to one Duncan's,
                    <br/>where we fed our horses and dined from the supply <br/>of our bags, it
                    being eighteen miles; from thence to<br/> one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/bove1">Bovear's<persname key="bove1"></persname></a>, where three of our company lodged. <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a> and myself rode six miles further to
                    <br/>my cousin, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/acoat1">Abner Coats's<persname key="acoat1"></persname></a>, who is just
                    newly settled in <br/>the woods; has got about ten acres of land cleared
                    <br/>and seems in a likely way to make a living. He was <br/>very kind and glad
                    to see me; tied up our horses, <br/>fed them with bran and cut corn-tops, with
                    which <br/>they seemed to do very well. All this stage appeared <br/>to me to be
                    very poor, until we turned off the road <br/>and got near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/acoat1">Abner's<persname key="acoat1"></persname></a>, where the land appears tolera-<br/>bly level and pretty
                    good soil. We crossed one large <br/>and one lesser stream running to the right,
                    called <br/><geogname key="conyc">Conyconeys</geogname>. Divers places the road
                    was intolerable <br/>for short steep hills,--so much so that going down
                    <br/>some of them, leading our horses, we seemed in dan-<br/>ger of their
                    falling down upon us. This day, rode <br/>thirty-four miles.</p>

<p> Rode from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/acoat1">Abner Coats's<persname key="acoat1"></persname></a> to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/funk1">Funk's<persname key="funk1"></persname></a>, seventeen <br/>miles; it being a very rainy

                    sloughs <br/>or little guts descending out of the mountains, that <br/>for bad
                    traveling it exceeded all I have yet met with. <br/>We crossed two large

                    second, <geogname key="slipp">Slippery Rock</geogname>. From thence to
                    <br/>McClern's, nine miles. The road tolerably good for <br/>this country and
                    the land about middling, being much <br/>covered with white oak. At this place
                    we arrived <br/>about two in the afternoon; appearing to be good quar-<br/>ters
                    for ourselves and horses, we stayed all night, and <br/>lodged comfortably in
                    the barn.</p>

<p> Set off early and rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/frank">Franklin<placename key="frank"></placename></a>
<note resp="editor">[country <br/>seat of Venango county, Pa.]</note>, a small
                    town of perhaps <br/>ten or fifteen houses, on <geogname key="french">French
                        creek</geogname>, a small dis-<br/>tance above the fort at the junction of
                    said creek and <br/>the <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny river</geogname>,
                    thirteen miles. The most of <br/>this stage is stony chestnut land. About four
                    miles <br/>before we got to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/frank">Franklin<placename key="frank"></placename></a>, we
                    crossed <geogname key="sandy">Sandy Creek</geogname>, <br/>the descent and
                    ascent of the mountains on each <br/>side being each of them about half a mile,
                    and in <br/>some places, I think near forty-five degrees of eleva-<br/>tion.
                    Going down the hill I discovered my mare had <br/>lost one of her shoes, and by
                    the time I got to this <br/>place she began to limp pretty much, and no smith
                    <br/>here. The prospect looks dull to proceed from here <br/>to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtitu1">Jonathan Titus's<persname key="jtitu1"></persname></a>, on <geogname key="oilcr">Oil
                        Creek</geogname>, eighteen miles. Im-<br/> mediately after leaving
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/frank">Franklin<placename key="frank"></placename></a> we crossed <geogname key="french">French <br/>Creek</geogname>, and soon entered very poor,
                    barren land <br/>which continued for several miles; then came to land <br/>more
                    level than any we have seen the west side of <br/><geogname key="alleg">Allegheny river</geogname>, for so much; some bottoms, very <br/>rich
                    abounding with plums, some of it rather too <br/>much upon a dead level to be
                    very good for wheat, <br/>and exceeding thick set with small timber,
                    partic-<br/>larly quaking asp. About twelve miles from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/frank">Frank-lin<placename key="frank"></placename></a> we came across a cabin and a few acres of
                    <br/>ground cleared, where the people looked clean and <br/>decent; had
                    abundance of watermelons with which <br/>they regaled us plentifully without
                    charge. A few <br/>more cabins and small lots cleared we saw on our way
                    <br/>between <geogname key="french">French Creek</geogname> and <geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname>. Rattlesnakes <br/>abound here. I saw a
                    large one of about three feet <br/>nine inches long, and about as thick as my
                    wrist. I <br/>alighted and killed it; cut off the rattles, being nine.
                    <br/>Great numbers of wild tur-<br/>keys are here; we saw several flocks
                    containing forty <br/>or more and might easily have shot some of them if <br/>we
                    had had guns and ammunition.</p>
<p> We arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtitu1">Titus's<persname key="jtitu1"></persname></a> a little before sunset;
                    got our <br/>horses to good pasture, and lodged comfortably in his <br/>barn.
                    Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtitu1">Titus<persname key="jtitu1"></persname></a> being a young man, settled here on
                        <br/><geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname> in the woods about two and a
                    half years <br/>ago, has made a great improvement for the time; <br/>owns 400
                    acres of land, the most of it a rich bottom; <br/>has got about twenty-six acres
                    of excellent corn in <br/>the ground, a considerable quantity of wheat in stack;
                    <br/>a spring of excellent water near the door, large enough <br/>to turn a
                    breast-mill; so that upon the whole I think <br/>this farm likely in time to be
                    of most inestimable <br/>value, <geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname> being
                    boatable this high, which is <br/>about eighteen miles from the mouth where it
                    empties <br/>into <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny</geogname>. <geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname> took its name from the oil <br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_05" n="469"></pb> which is skimmed off the water in great
                    quantities, <br/>resembling the Seneca or British oil in smell; its <br/>length
                    being about thirty-six miles from its mouth to <br/>the place where it issues
                    out of a small lake.</p>

<p> Being very rainy, I rode two miles to a black-<br/>smith at <geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname> mill, got a shoe on my mare and
                    <br/>returned to my company at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtitu1">Titus's<persname key="jtitu1"></persname></a>, where
                    we remained <br/>all this day, it being very wet, and lodged in the same

<p> Being a fine morning, we set off early and <br/>rode twenty-nine miles near the
                    mouth of a large <br/>stream called <geogname key="broke">Brokenstraw</geogname>, where we pitched our <br/>tent, kindled a fire, and
                    lodged in the woods. I am <br/>not furnished with language or memory to describe
                    <br/>the particulars of this day's journey, but may en-<br/>deavor to note some
                    particulars. After leaving <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtitu1">Titus's<persname key="jtitu1"></persname></a>
<br/>we rode two miles to a newly erected mill and saw-<br/>mill on a branch of
                        <geogname key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogname>, which the Holland <br/>Company
                    have erected in order to supply the new <br/>settlers with flour, etc., and
                    divers of them come there <br/>twenty, twenty-five, and more miles with bags of
                    <br/>grain on a horse, to be ground; there being no road <br/>that any carriage
                    can pass, and indeed, (to such who <br/>have not seen those mountainous new
                    countries), it <br/>would appear to impraticable to pass with a single
                    <br/>horse. After leaving the mill we soon entered a<br/>forest of white pine,
                    hemlock and divers other sorts <br/>of timber not necessary to mention, and
                    great part of <br/>our ride this day was through timber of that sort; <br/>some
                    of the way tolerably level, but a great part of it <br/>such mountains thickly
                    set with stones and rocks, <br/>which together with the interlocking of the
                    roots <br/>of the timber, a little comparable to a corn-rid-<br/>dle, and the
                    deep swampy guts, it was with difficulty <br/>we got along over roots and rock
                    the cavities be-<br/>tween them being so deep and so close together that<br/>had
                    our horses got their legs in, (and this to appear-<br/>ance seemed almost
                    unavoidable), they must have <br/>been broken. But I suppose the way to be much
                    bet-<br/>ter than it was two years ago, being now a cut path <br/>all the way,
                    which was not the case then. In many <br/>places the timber is, I believe, from
                    one hundred to <br/>two hundred feet high, and thickly set, insomuch that <br/>a
                    great part of the face of the ground and rocks <br/>is scarcely ever saluted
                    with the luminous rays of the <br/>sun, which I think is the reason of the rocks
                    and old <br/>logs being very thick set with coats of moss; and as <br/> the seed
                    of different kinds of trees falls on this moss <br/>which the rocks and old logs
                    contain, there being <br/>moisture enough contained in it to occasion a
                    vegeta-<br/>tion, the body or trunk ascends and the roots crawl<br/> on the
                    surface of the rock or log to the edge, and then <br/>descend into the gorund,
                    and great numbers of that <br/>description are grown into large trees the roots
                    of <br/>which clasp a rock a little similar to the clasp of an <br/>eagles claw;
                    and on many of these rocks there are <br/>several trees. I saw one rock about
                    twenty feet in <br/>diameter, which had seven trees on it, some of <br/>which
                    were two or three feet over and perhaps <br/>one hundred and fifty feet high and
                    the rock <br/>ten or twelve feet high. I think we saw neither <br/>house nor
                    improvement for twenty miles; neither <br/>can I suppose much of it will be
                    settled for many <br/>years to come, We came on the <geogname key="broke">Brokenstraw</geogname> about<br/> seven miles above the mouth and rode sixe
                    miles down <br/>the stream to the place of our encampment, through <br/>a very
                    rich bottom. As I rode along this day <br/>I frequently experienced a transition
                    of ideas; <br/>while passing through the dark shades of the thick <br/>and lofty
                    timber which sometimes appeared like a <br/>desolate, gloomy wilderness
                    comparable to the gloom <br/>of eternal night; and other times so great, so
                    grand, <br/>so magnificent that it became truly transporting.</p>

<p> Set off early, without taking breakfast or <br/>feeding our horses. Rode down
                    the aforesaid creek <br/>almost to the mouth and with some difficulty got
                    <br/>along, the Indian path up the river being in many <br/>places hard to be
                    discovered, to a place called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/warre">War-ren<placename key="warre"></placename></a><note resp="editor"> [now the county seat of Warren
                        county],</note> being a <br/>newly laid out town, but without much building
                    ex-<br/>cept one cabin and a storehouse built by the Hol<br/>land Company near
                    the mouth of another large <br/>stream called <geogname key="concr">Connowongo</geogname>. Here we breakfasted <br/>and fed our horses. The
                    people in the cabin were <br/>very kind, made our chocolate for us and gave us
                    <br/>some good pigeon soup. [Distance] nine miles. Here <br/>we hired a guide;
                    rode over the <geogname key="concr">Connowongo</geogname>, and <br/>followed our
                    guide with undescribable difficulty <br/>about sixteen miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/cornp">Cornplanter's settlement<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>. The <br/>logs, the brush,
                    and thick-set young timber rendered <br/>this stage extremely difficult and
                    tiresome; almost a <br/>continual succession of logs, in many places three or
                    <br/>four in a perch, as high as our horses could step over, <br/>and many of
                    them they had to jump; and the young <br/>growth being so thick that if we were
                    two rods apart <br/>we would have to call out to each other in fear of
                    be-<br/>ing lost. About an hour before sunset we reached the <br/>new house
                    which <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> is getting built, and
                    <br/>the schoolhouse where <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hsimm1">Henry Simmons<persname key="hsimm1"></persname></a>
                    teaches the <br/>young Indians, at which place we met with Henry, <br/>greatly
                    to our mutual comfort, and where we tarried <br/>all night in the schoolhouse.
                    At this place there are <br/>several comfortable houses building, it being about
                    <br/>one mile lower down the river than where <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/cornp">Cornplan-ter's village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a> stands, and appears to be on more
                    suita-<br/>ble ground, which with the advice of our young men, <br/>the Indian
                    inhabitants of the town just above, pro-<br/>posed to move. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and many others of the <br/>nation came
                    this evening to visit us, and appeared to <br/>be much pleased with our
                    coming.</p>

<p> This morning the old chief and some of his <br/>connections brought us some
                    cucumbers to help out <br/>our breakfast, and immediately returned to his
                    vil-<br/>lage. We then soon set off up the river, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hsimm1">Henry

                    <br/>came to the town. Stopped a few minutes with the <br/>Indians who gathered
                    around us apparently much <br/>pleased with our arrival. We proposed a council
                    or <br/>conference with them, to be held in two days after <br/>that time, to
                    which they readily assented, and agreed <br/>to send out some runners to inform
                    their people. <br/>We then took leave of them for the present and
                    pro-<br/>ceeded up and across the river twice to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, <br/>to our dear friends, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday Jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jswai1">Joel

<p> Stayed with our friends and visited several <br/>families of Indians in their
                    houses and cabins. One <br/>Indian, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ijohn1">John<persname key="ijohn1"></persname></a>, has
                    built himself a snug house and <br/>kitchen, the logs well-hewn and the joists
                    and boards <br/>planed, [with] sash and glass windows. He has <br/>mowed and
                    made two good stacks of hay, fenced in <br/>several acres of ground in which he
                    has good corn; <br/>and several others of them are improving in their
                    <br/>buildings, fencing, etc. We have fared very well <br/>this day on provision
                    wellcooked by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday Jack-son<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a>; also
                    walked about and reviewed the improve-<br/>ment made by our young friends in
                    this wilderness <br/>country, which appears considerable. And although<br/>I
                    think the spot they are settled upon is much infer-<br/>ior to many other places
                    in these parts for fertility, <br/>yet their corn and buckwheat are good; [they]
                    had <br/>pretty good oats, have a considerable quantity of hay <br/>procured, a
                    large garden of good vegetables, and have <br/>about five acres of ground
                    cleared and plowed ready <br/>to sow wheat. They have got a comfortable
                    two-<br/>story house to live in, and several other necessary<br/>buildings.</p>

Had a <br/>pleasant sail down the river, and
                    arrived at our des-<br/>tined port a little before 11 o'clock, divers of the
                    dis-<br/>tant chiefs being collected before we came. Before <br/>we sat in
                    council, walked about, viewing some of the <br/>Indian cottages and their dress,
                    which would take <br/>more time to describe than I am at this time
                    dis-<br/>posed to take. About an hour after we arrived, a <br/>large horn,
                    something like a French horn, was <br/>blown, in order to collect the chiefs and
                    others to <br/>council; and in a short time they collected in a part <br/>of
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter's<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> house or cabin, perhaps to
                    the num-<br/>ber of thirty or more. We all sat down in stillness a <br/>short
                    space, when the old chief stood up (his son <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/habee1">Henry

<p> Brothers, I am glad the good Spirit has favored <br/>you all with health
                            in your long journey to come and <br/>see us and take us by the hand, so
                            that we may <br/>brighten the chain of friendship; and now some of
                            <br/>us are collected, we should be glad to hear what you <br/>have to
                            say to us.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> We then informed them that we had taken a long <br/>journey to see our young men
                    who were settled <br/>among our Indian brothers, and that we had not <br/>much
                    that we knew of to say to the Indians; only to <br/>know from themselves how
                    they liked our young <br/>men being amongst them, and whether they thought
                    <br/>they were likely to be useful to them or not. We <br/>then had our
                    certificate read and interpreted to them, <br/>with which they expressed
                    satisfaction; and we hav-<br/>ing agreed upon a short piece of advice or queries
                    to <br/>lay before them, which we had in writing, it was read <br/>by paragraphs
                    and interpreted to them as follows:</p>

<p> "Brothers, you have now heard that our coming <br/>here was to see how
                            you and our young men who <br/>live amongst you are getting along. We
                            are glad the <br/>Good Spirit has favored us to meet you in health, and
                            <br/>given us this opportunity of taking you by the hand <br/>and
                            brightening the chain of friendship. Now broth-<br/>ers, we should like
                            to hear from your own mouths if <br/>you are quite satisfied with our
                            young men living <br/>amongst you. They came here with a hope of being
                            <br/>useful, by instructing you in a better way of manag-<br/>ing your
                            land and providing for yourselves and your <br/>cattle. We desire you to
                            speak freely brothers. It <br/>has been some satisfaction to us in
                            riding through <br/>your town to see marks of industry taking place;
                            that <br/>you are building better and warmer houses to live in; <br/>and
                            that so much of your cleared land is planted with <br/>corn, potatoes,
                            beans, squashes, cucumbers, etc., and <br/>to see these articles kept in
                            good order. Brothers, we <br/>observe where your new houses are
                            building, that the <br/>timber is very much cut off a rich flat which we
                            wish <br/>you encouraged to clear and make it fit for plowing. <br/>We
                            believe it to be very good land for wheat, as well <br/>as corn, and as
                            the white people are settling around <br/>you, the deer and other wild
                            game will grow scarce <br/>and more difficult to be taken. We therefore
                            hope <br/>that more of your men will assist in clearing land,
                            <br/>fencing it, planting it with corn, and sowing it with <br/>wheat.
                            You will then have a supply of provision <br/>more certain to depend
                            upon than hunting. Broth-<br/>ers, we were pleased to see your stock of
                            cattle in-<br/>creased; the rich bottoms on the river will be plenty
                            <br/>for them to live on in the summer season, but as your <br/>winters
                            are long and cold, it will require something <br/>for them to live on in
                            the winter. Now the white <br/>people keep their cattle on hay, on straw
                            and on <br/>corn-fodder. Straw you cannot get until you raise <br/>wheat
                            or other grain; the rich bottoms, if they were <br/>put in order, would
                            produce a great deal of hay; but <br/>for an immediate supply, we think,
                            if as soon as you <br/>gather your corn you would cut the stalks close
                            at <br/>the ground, bind them up in small bundles, and put <br/>them in
                            stack, as our young men do, they would keep <br/>the cattle part of the
                            cold weather. Brothers, we <br/>are glad to see a quantity of new fence
                            made this <br/>summer, near where our young men live, and we <br/>would
                            not have you get discouraged at the labor it <br/>takes; for if you will
                            clear a little more land every <br/>year and fence it, you will soon get
                            enough to raise <br/>what bread you want, as well as some for grass to
                            <br/>make hay for winter. Brothers, we understand you <br/>are desirous
                            to discourage whiskey from being <br/>brought amongst you, with which we
                            are much <br/>pleased, and should be glad you could entirely keep
                            <br/>it away; for to get it, you give your money which <br/>you should
                            have to buy clothes with, and to buy <br/>oxen and plows with to work
                            your land; and it does <br/>not do you any good."</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> After which a solemn silence took place, in which <br/>I thought I felt love to
                    flow to the poor natives, <br/>accompanied by a strong desire that they might be
                    <br/>prevailed upon to wholly decline the drinking of <br/>distilled spirits;
                    for truly I think until some reforma-<br/>tion in that respect takes place
                    amongst them, the <br/>solid ground on which we can expect their
                    profit-<br/>able civilization is small; and though I felt as I did, <br/>it
                    seemed discouraging to offer anything to them on <br/>the occasion, considering
                    my own inability and the <br/>imperfect interpreter we had--being one who hath a
                    <br/>strong inclination to the evil habit himself. So I had <br/>liked to have
                    omitted saying anything, until my friend <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua
                        Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>, whispered to me and told me if I <br/>had anything to
                    say to them not to omit it. I then <br/>addressed them in substance as
                    follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1799-09-14">Ninth month 14th, [1799]</date>.
                                <placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p> Brothers, your brothers, the Quakers, who have <br/>come a long way to
                            see you, believe that the Great <br/>Spirit made both white men and red
                            men, and placed <br/>them on this great island, gave them many good
                            <br/>things to live upon such as grain, flesh, fruit, etc., and <br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_08" n="483"></pb> also gave them understanding
                            hearts. And we also <br/>believe that his design or intention was that
                            we <br/>should love and serve him, and not only love him <br/>and our
                            own people but love and be at peace with all <br/>people of all nations
                            and colors. But some white <br/>men became very cunning and sought out
                            new inven-<br/>tions, one of which was making rum, whiskey, <br/>brandy,
                            etc., out of the good things that he had given <br/>them, which at first
                            was used in very small quantities <br/>as medicine; but as it became
                            more plenty, many <br/>white men got to love it and drink more of it
                            inso-<br/>much that they became drunk and neglected their <br/>business;
                            many of their wives and children suffered <br/>in want of food and
                            clothing, and it seemed to be the <br/>beginner or forerunner of almost
                            every bad practice.</p>
<p> Now brothers, some of your friends, the Quakers, <br/>many years since
                            were favored to see the mischief <br/>that rum and whiskey had done, and
                            believed it right <br/>for them not to drink any more, and have found by
                            <br/>more than twenty years' experience that they can do <br/>better
                            without it than with it. And seeing the mis-<br/>chief it did to others,
                            and how much better they <br/>themselves did without it, believed it
                            right to per-<br/>suade others to do so too; and as we love our Indian
                            <br/>brothers, and seeing their land is much sold and <br/>white people
                            settling all round them whereby the <br/>deer and other game is likely
                            to become so scarce <br/>that they cannot live by hunting much longer,
                            we <br/>were drawn in compassion to invite some of our young <br/>men to
                            come and live amongst you, in order to in-<br/>struct you in the useful
                            ways of the white people who <br/>have now been some time with you. But
                            we under-<br/>stand that some bad white men let Indians have
                            <br/>whiskey and that many of them love it so much that <br/>they often
                            get drunk and are wicked. Brothers, we <br/>wish you would not hearken
                            to those bad men who <br/>want you to buy their whiskey, nor give way to
                            your <br/>own love for it, but stand against it and not use any <br/>of
                            it; for if you do, your friends, the Quakers, will <br/>be discouraged
                            and hang down their heads and go <br/>and leave you. But if you will
                            stand against it and <br/>not use it, become sober men, they will be
                            willing to <br/>assist and instruct you what they can.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> I believe the interpreter endeavored to render it <br/>into the Indian language
                    as well as he could, though <br/>he appeared somewhat convicted; and I also
                    think <br/>they understood it pretty well, as there appeared a <br/>general
                    concurrence by their usual nod and sound on <br/>such occasions, and by what the
                    old chief said to us <br/>after, on our asking them if they had anything to say
                    <br/>to us, he replied that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hsimm1">Henry Simmons<persname key="hsimm1"></persname></a> had
                    told him <br/>some time ago that he intended to go home this fall, <br/>(Henry
                    having taught school at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/cornp">Cornplanter's
                    village<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>), <br/>and that he could not give us an answer until he knew
                    <br/>whether Henry would go or not. We then agreed to <br/>be a little time by
                    ourselves. They left us a few min-<br/>utes and we laid the matter close to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hsimm1">Henry<persname key="hsimm1"></persname></a>. He then <br/>told us that he
                    believed it was his duty to come here <br/>and he now believed it was his place
                    to go home, <br/>which we could not gainsay, though we felt sorry the
                    <br/>Indian children should be left without an instructor. <br/>The chiefs were
                    called in again, and tenderly informed <br/>of Henry's intention of returning.
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> then <br/>replied if it was
                    right, he could not say against it, but <br/>was afraid he should not have help
                    enough to keep <br/>away the whiskey, as Henry had been a great help to <br/>him
                    in that, and that he thought the Indians would <br/>now mind him more than they
                    would one of them; <br/>and then said that when our young men came first
                    <br/>amongst them some of their warriors did not like it, <br/>but now he
                    believed they all liked it, and all <br/>spoke very well of them, and wished the
                    young <br/>men to tell us if any of the young Indians or others <br/>behaved bad
                    to them. They then all rose up and in <br/>a friendly manner shook hands with us
                    and did what <br/>they call "cover the council fire." Then one of their
                    <br/>women brought in a large loaf of unleavened wheat <br/>bread and a tin cup
                    full of pretty good butter, on <br/>which we dined and took our departure up the
                    river. <br/>Halliday Jackson, James Cooper, and myself walked, <br/>the others
                    all went back in the canoes we came down in. <br/>Arrived at the young men's
                    home just before sunset, <br/>and lodged this night with them.</p>
<note resp="editor">[NOTE.--<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, at the

                    only, the son of a white man <br/>named <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jobai1">John

                    trader. He is believed to <br/>have been with the French in the defeat of

                    however, he devoted himself to peace, and <br/>refused to fight. In the Indian
                    disturbances from 1791 to 1794, he <br/>kept the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> friendly, and he continued to live on his
                    reserva-<br/>tion to his death, in 1836, when he was considered to be about 100
                    <br/>years old. The accounts of him say that "he deplored the evils <br/>of
                    intemperance, and exerted himself to suppress it.]</note>

                    Have not gone much
                    <br/>out of the house to-day. Sat down with the young<br/>men at their usual
                    time of holding their meeting, <br/>which to me and I believe to others was a
                    solid, <br/>strengthening time. A little after night, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> went out of the house and just as he came
                    <br/>in, the trap-door of the cellar being open, he stepped<br/> in it and fell
                    with the back of his head against one of <br/>the joists or sleepers, and so
                    down into the cellar. <br/>We all made what haste we could down, finding him
                    <br/>stunned and senseless. We were exceedingly <br/>alarmed, got some camphor,
                    bathed his temples and <br/>other places so that in about two or three minutes
                    <br/>he came to so as to speak, but knew not that any-<br/> thing was the
                    matter, or where he was, for a con-<br/>siderable time. At length his
                    understanding re-<br/>turned, but he could not all the evening recollect
                    <br/>falling, being a good deal hurt. Our getting away <br/>from her as soon as
                    we proposed, [now] looks doubt-<br/> ful; but it is a great comfort to us to
                    find him as well <br/>as he appears to be. Went to bed and I slept with <br/>him
                    in some hopes he may be better in the morning.</p>

                   Joshua quite as well as we could expect,
                    <br/>but not fit to travel. This day we have had a visit <br/>from five or six
                    Indian chiefs who stayed with us <br/>the most of the day and appeared very much
                    pleased <br/>in being in our company and viewing a map which <br/>we had with
                    us. Soon got to understand it so that <br/>they could point out almost any of
                    the rivers and <br/>lakes. About noon Cornplanter came and brought us <br/>a
                    quarter of venison and two pigeons. Offered to <br/>send some of his people to
                    pilot us to Buffalo, but we <br/>could not tell him when we could go, not
                    knowing <br/>when our friend would be able to travel. About the <br/>middle of
                    the afternoon they all took an affectionate <br/>farewell of us for the
                    present.</p>

                    A fine day. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> appearing some better, <br/>eighteen or twenty of the
                    Indians came to see us and <br/>bade us farewell. About one o'clock we set off,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Hal-liday Jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> bearing us company.
                    We took an <br/>affectionate farewell of our other two friends, after <br/>an
                    uniting opportunity just before parting. Rode <br/>about four miles up the river
                    through middling good <br/>land to the house of one of the old chiefs who was
                    <br/>with us yesterday, and who had his horse standing <br/>hitched ready to
                    pilot us up the river to a small set-<br/>tlement of Indians. On riding along we
                    discovered <br/>they had the day before opened and cut the path <br/>wider and
                    better for several miles just on our ac-<br/>count; and on our way we passed a
                    new settlement, <br/>made this summer by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Halftown<persname key="halft1"></persname></a>, on some most excel-<br/>lent land. Where he lives he
                    has cleared and fenced <br/>two or three acres and got it in with corn and
                    vines. <br/>After crossing the river we rode to another chief's <br/>house where
                    there are several cabins, and pitched our <br/>tent and lodged on the river
                    bank. They were kind <br/>to us in their way, and gave us two very good
                    squir-<br/> rels. This being ten miles up the river.</p>

<p>
                    Being a rainy morning, we set off having
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sunfi1">Sunfish<persname key="sunfi1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday Jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> for our guides, which <br/>we found to be very
                    useful to use before night, it be-<br/>ing a very wet day and much of the way so
                    swampy <br/>and difficult that we should have been much beset <br/>without them.
                    Abundance of the way through, the <br/>wilderness is so stopped up with wind
                    falls of timber, <br/>many of which are so large in low ground and fallen
                    <br/>one on another for a mile together, that to a stranger <br/>it would seem
                    altogether impassable. Many of these <br/>with great difficulty we have to jump
                    our horses over, <br/>and perhaps in mud half leg deep; and many of <br/>them
                    were so large no horse could leap them. We <br/>went up the river three miles
                    and then took up a <br/>valley about twelve miles, down which a creek of
                    <br/>about the size of our branch of Brandywine runs. <br/>Excellent good land
                    all the way up, there being <br/>abundance of sugar maple, beech, ash, birch,
                    and <br/>bass. I have seen sugar maple in abundance that <br/>were three feet
                    over and near one hundred feet high; <br/>the other timber in proportion. We
                    then ascended <br/>a very high mountain; good land up it, and on the <br/>top
                    still good, being covered with very heavy, lofty <br/>timber some of which is
                    white pine, some poplar, <br/>and the other as before mentioned. Before we
                    as-<br/>cended the mountain we came to the heads of springs<br/>within a few
                    perches of each other, some of which<br/>run into the <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny</geogname> and some into the <geogname key="catar">Cattarau-<br/>gus</geogname>. The former empties into the <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname>; the latter <br/>into <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname> and so down the river <geogname key="stlar">St.
                        Lawrence</geogname>. <br/>In some places, abundance of wild cherry three and
                    <br/>four feet in diameter, perhaps sixty and some eighty <br/>feet to the first
                    limb. But as I do not intend to give <br/>a minute description of the land,
                    water, and timber, <br/>only to give a sketch of what appeared remarkable,
                    <br/>suffice it to say that in this day's ride, (which was a <br/>very wet one
                    through abundance of swampy land), I <br/>think the land was generally good and
                    heavy loaded <br/>with timber. This day's ride, twenty-four miles. <br/>Pitched
                    our tent by a spring amongst lofty timber, <br/>and just after we got our fire
                    made and tent raised, it <br/>began to rain very fast, and was an exceeding wet
                    <br/>night, accompanied with a great wind or storm inso-<br/>much that we heard
                    the tree falling almost all <br/>around us. Our situation appeared to be
                    somewhat <br/>trying; but as we had no alternative, soon composed <br/>oursevles
                    and went to sleep.</p>

<p> It being likely for a fair <br/>day, we set off, though the bushes were very
                    wet, and<br/>rode to <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogname>, 27 miles, and
                    pitched our tent on <br/>the margin thereof. We passed some very bad,
                    <br/>swampy road in the morning. The timber and land <br/>much as yesterday and
                    almost all the way, so far as <br/>I have come through the New York State, there
                    ap-<br/> pear to be very few stones. But after riding 8 or 10 <br/>miles this
                    day, we came to abundance of the most <br/>beautiful poplar trees I have ever
                    seen; and about <br/>one mile before we crossed <geogname key="catar">Cattaraugus River</geogname> we <br/>came into a bottom of very rich land,
                    wherein abun-<br/>dance of black walnut stand, many of them three, <br/>four,
                    five, and perhaps some six feet in diameter, and <br/>sixty or severty feet to
                    the first limb. Crossed <geogname key="catar">Cat-<br/>taraugus</geogname>,
                    being ten miles from our lodging, and rode <br/>ten more to an Indian village.
                    Stopped awhile with <br/>them, but as their chief was not at home we soon
                    <br/>left them, and rode seven miles through a low piece <br/>of land heavily
                    timbered with hemlock, sugar ma-<br/>ple, etc., to the lake aforesaid, which, to
                    be sure, at <br/>first view exhibited a grand prospect here in the
                    <br/>wilderness, appearing both as to motion and sound <br/>like the ocean. Had
                    a good supper of chocolate, <br/>cooked by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a>, who is yet with us; got a com-<br/>fortable night's
                    sleep, and early in the morning, for <br/>the first time, heard a wolf howl.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1799-09-20">20th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode 28 miles down the lake on the beach <br/>or margin thereof to the mouth of
                        <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogname>. <br/>Crossed it in a boat
                    and swam our horses over, it be-<br/>ing a very deep channel, about 30 or 40
                    yards wide. <br/>Lodged at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">Joseph Elliot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a>'s
                    headquarters, he being the <br/>principal surveyor or superintendent of the
                    Holland <br/>Company's business. Were kindly entertained free <br/>of cost. This
                    day's ride down the lake was a de-<br/>lightful journey, affording such a
                    variety of prospect <br/>of the wonderful works of nature. Some places the
                    <br/>land at the margin of the lake appeared to be pretty <br/>level; in most
                    others there was a wall on our right <br/>hand, in many places 50, some 60, and
                    some near, if <br/>not quite, 100 feet high and almost perpendicular; <br/>the
                    beach or margin from the water to the wall, <br/>very diverse for width, some of
                    20 yards, some 10, <br/>some 5, and in several places the wall butted into the
                    <br/>water, where we several times had to ride in round <br/>the points of rocks
                    knee-deep and sometimes belly-<br/>deep; and in one or two places between a
                    large pyra-<br/>mid of rock and the wall on the right, the pyramind
                    <br/>appearing conical or in the form of a sugar loaf about <br/>ten feet in
                    diameter at its base, and about twelve <br/>feet high. These cones, I believe,
                    are made by the <br/>dashing of waves, together with the freezing of <br/>the
                    water in the winter, in the smooth joints of the <br/>rocks, whereby abundance
                    of them fall down, parting <br/> off from their fellows in smooth, perpendicular
                    <br/>points. The high, perpendicular wall exhibits a curi-<br/>ous view; the
                    stone appears to be principally com-<br/>posed of slate and limestone in
                    different regular <br/>strata of layers. The bottom or lowermost rocks that
                    <br/> I discovered in most places are limestone, curiously <br/>laid in a
                    horizontal form and nicely jointed in <br/>squares of eight, ten, or twelve feet
                    in diameter, the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_11" n="502"></pb> joints or vaccuums between them mostly
                    about an <br/>inch wide. Some places we found them to extend into <br/>the lake;
                    other places not quite to the edge of it; and <br/>in others not within ten
                    yards of it. Where they ex-<br/>tended to the lake, they formed a beautiful
                    level to <br/>ride upon. The next layer or stratum is slate about <br/>ten feet
                    perpendicular. In some places it appeared <br/>very shelly or near rotten; in
                    many others, excel-<br/>lent slate in great quantities either for flagging or
                    <br/>covering for houses. Then one general layer of lime-<br/>stone about
                    fifteen or eighteen inches thick; then <br/>pretty generally slate or other
                    stone to the top of the <br/>wall or abutment, all which are curiously jointed
                    in <br/>smooth squares or columnes some two feet square, <br/>some five, and
                    some in oblong squares two or three <br/>feet by eight or ten. And as the water
                    in wet times <br/>penetrates down those joints, I suppose it freezes in <br/>the
                    winter and bursts off the columns, which fall <br/>down on the margin of the
                    lake, in many places large <br/>bodies of them together as much as several
                    square <br/>rods, and the timber on the top with them. In many <br/>places the
                    trees were hanging by one half of the<br/>roots with their tops below a level,
                    and some right <br/>top downwards and not touching the bottom. In <br/>many
                    places by the continual dahsing of the waves <br/> against the rocks they are
                    worn in curious forms.</p>

<p> Rode three miles down on the margin of the <br/>lake and <geogname key="niagr">river Niagara</geogname> to the ferry. No such curious <br/>wall on our
                    right hand as yesterday, but similar beds <br/>of limestone. This <geogname key="niagr">Niagara River</geogname> is the great outlet <br/>of all the
                    northwestern lakes and waters, which <br/>makes a very great river above a mile
                    wide and of <br/>great depth, running very rapidly. We crossed the <br/>river in
                    a boat, which the heavy current drives across <br/>in a few minutes, which to
                    some of our company ap-<br/>peared a little terrifying; and then rode up on the
                    <br/> margin of the lake on the other side about eight <br/>miles, which appears
                    to be pretty level except some <br/>very high banks of sand and a general bed of
                    lime-<br/>stone lying in a form similar to the lower bed <br/>on the other side.
                    Then turned off from the lake <br/>about a mile to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/dpoun1">Daniel
                        Pound<persname key="dpoun1"></persname></a>'s, where four of us <br/>dined and left some linen to be
                    washed (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday Jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hhart1">Hugh Hartshorn<persname key="hhart1"></persname></a> having part with us <br/> at the
                    ferry and gone down to view the great <geogname key="niagf">Falls</geogname>).
                    <br/>We then rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ascho1">Asa Schooly<persname key="ascho1"></persname></a>'s, where we
                    met with<br/>our beloved friends <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wblak1">Wiiliam
                        Blakey<persname key="wblak1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a>
<br/>and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpaxs1">Jacob Paxson<persname key="jpaxs1"></persname></a>, who we heard had
                    arrived two <br/>days before us. Here we all propose to stay this <br/>night,
                    our kind friend and landlord appearing to have <br/>things comfortably
                    convenient about him. They said <br/>they could contrive for bedding for us all;
                    but <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a> and myself were
                    desirous to sleep <br/>on the floor with our blankets, believing it would be
                    <br/>best on several accounts; but we could not do it with-<br/>out hurting our
                    friend's feelings, so consented to take <br/>a bed. But when we got to the bed
                    chamber by our-<br/>selves, we found a good clean bed and clothing, which
                    <br/>we examined, and found a thin straw bed on the <br/>sacking. We then took
                    off the feather bed and laid <br/>it in the corner of the room, expecting we
                    should not <br/>be discovered. But our kind friend came into the <br/>room and
                    found the bed in the corner, but did not any <br/>more insist upon our
                    compliance with their request.</p>

<p> Stayed and attended <br/>their meeting, which is held in the house of our
                    <br/>friend, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ascho1">Asa Schooly<persname key="ascho1"></persname></a>, where we lodged,
                    which to me <br/>was a dull time, though some lively communications
                    <br/>therein. After dinner I took an affection farewell <br/>of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hjack1">Halliday Jackson<persname key="hjack1"></persname></a>, who was returned from viewing
                    <br/>the great Falls and is now about to return through a <br/>lonesome
                    wilderness to Genesinguhta, the place of <br/>his present abode. We then classed
                    ourselves in <br/>order to visit the families in this neighborhood,
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpaxs1">Jacob Paxson<persname key="jpaxs1"></persname></a>, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a>
<br/>going in one company, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wblak1">William Blakey<persname key="wblak1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>, and myself in another. <br/>We
                    then proceeded to and visited the families of <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcutl1">John
                        Cutler<persname key="jcutl1"></persname></a>, a member; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jharr2">John Harret<persname key="jharr2"></persname></a>,
                    and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ascho2">Azariah Schooly<persname key="ascho2"></persname></a>. Neither of the last
                    two in membership, but <br/>hopeful, well inclined people. Returned to lodge at
                    <br/>the same place. I may here note that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua
                        Sharp-les<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>, in getting into the boat at <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogname>, slipped <br/>and fell on the edge of
                    hte boat, which at first did <br/>not seem very bad, but [he] hath been
                    gradually <br/>getting worse. We now think some of his short ribs <br/>are
                    broken, and it looks as if he would hardly be fit to <br/>travel to-morrow.</p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> being too much amiss to
                    <br/>venture out, we set out without him and had religious <br/>opportunities in
                    the families of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/dpoun1">Daniel Pound<persname key="dpoun1"></persname></a>, the

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> being unable to travel, we
                    <br/>left him and rode thirty miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwill1">John
                        Wills<persname key="jwill1"></persname></a>'s, where <br/>we lodged. On our way we rode fourteen miles
                    down <br/>the <geogname key="niagr">river Niagara</geogname>, crossed <geogname key="chipp">Chippeway River</geogname> and passed <br/>the <geogname key="niagf">great Falls</geogname>. Several of our company were
                    dis-<br/>posed to take a view of the great phenomenon, but <br/>James Cooper and
                    myself thought there was not time <br/>sufficient to satisfy our curiosity, so
                    rode on and left <br/> them to take a slight view. We all met at the
                    afore-<br/>said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwill1">Wills<persname key="jwill1"></persname></a>'s, and had an
                    opportunity of retirement in <br/>the family, in which was some pretty close

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> met us yesterday in the
                    <br/>afternoon, being somewhat better, but weakly yet. <br/>We visited the
                    families of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jgilh1">Joshua Gillam<persname key="jgilh1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/bwill1">Ben-jamin Will<persname key="bwill1"></persname></a>, both members, and the family of

                    a tender visitation to<br/><pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_12" n="503"></pb> him. We then
                    returned to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore<persname key="jmoor2"></persname></a>'s, where <br/>we
                    met with the rest of our company; had a solid <br/>conference among ourselves
                    respecting the nature <br/>of our appointment, which hath felt increasintly
                    <br/>weighty. Four of us lodged here, to wit: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan

                    and myself <br/>visited two families who are a little inclined to the

                    dinner. In <br/>the afternoon pad some social visits, and lodged at <br/>the

<p> Attended Friends' <br/>meeting at their usual time and place. After meeting,
                    <br/>walked four or five miles along with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan
                        Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a>
<br/>to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sbeck1">Samuel Becket<persname key="sbeck1"></persname></a>'s, where Nathan had
                    appointed a <br/>meeting to being at four o'clock, to which the neigh-<br/>bors
                    and many of the Firends from about their meet-<br/>ing house came, and which I
                    hope was a time of prof-<br/>itable instruction to some of them. On taking a
                    view <br/>of the earnest desire which many of them have to<br/>attend such
                    places, the compassionate feelings of my <br/>heart were very much awakened,
                    especially for their <br/> women, many of them going four or five miles on
                    <br/>foot, some of them with young children in their arms <br/>and others in
                    such a state that I should have thought <br/>scarcely fit to travel far on
                    horseback; yet they would <br/> and did walk faster than was easy for me, and
                    re-<br/>turned to their homes in a dark night, the men car-<br/>rying lighted
                    torches in their hands to show them <br/> the way along their muddy and rooty
                    roads. Lodged <br/>at the same place. </p>

<p> Spent part of the day agreeably with some <br/>of our friends; also had a solid
                    opportunity with a <br/>man who we believed had taken imagination for
                    rev-<br/>elation, which had led him into some strange acts <br/>and predictions.
                    I hope his state was so clearly <br/>opened and laid home to him that it may be
                    of use <br/>to him. He acknowledged he had been deceived and <br/>followed a
                    lying spirit. In the evening five of us re-<br/>turned to my lodging.</p>

<dateline><date when="1799-10-01">1st of the Tenth month [1799.]</date>
<placename key="pelh"></placename></dateline>
<p> We all attended a confer-<br/>ence before appointed to be held at Friends'
                    meeting-<br/>house in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/pelh">Pelham township<placename key="pelh"></placename></a>,
                    otherwise the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/short">Short Hills<placename key="short"></placename></a>, <br/>with the
                    members of said meeting and the Friends of <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/blacc">Black
                        Creek<placename key="blacc"></placename></a>, which was conducted with great solem-<br/>nity. In this
                    conference I was more fully convinced <br/>that there is a small number of
                    seeking, religiously <br/>minded Friends in both places, and that if they
                    <br/>abode in the patience and perseverance, the way <br/>would open ere long
                    for the establishment of a <br/>monthly meeting amongst them. But the rest of my
                    <br/>brethren believed the time was already come; so, <br/> after expressing my
                    doubts of their being fully ripe <br/>to be entrusted with the executive part of
                    our Disci-<br/>pline at this time, I freely submitted my feelings to <br/>the
                    judgment of those whom I esteem to be deeper <br/>in the religious experience.
                    It was then agree to <br/>open a new monthly meeting to-morrow at eleven
                    <br/>o'clock, to be known by the name of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/meetpelh">Pelham Monthly
                        Meeting<orgname key="meetpelh"></orgname></a> in Upper Canada, to be composed of Friends <br/>of
                    Pelham and Black Creek and to be held alternately <br/>at each place the first
                    Fourth day in every month.</p>

<p> Attended the opening of the new monthly <br/>meeting, it being a favored
                    opportunity, which re-<br/>vived a hope that if this small number of Friends
                    <br/>composing said meeting keep in humility and <br/>steady attention to the
                    best direction, their number and <br/>experience may so increase that the
                    testimony of <br/>truth may be supported amongst them. After meet-<br/>ing took
                    leave of our kind friends near the meeting-<br/>house and rode five miles to our
                    friend, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sbeck1">Samuel Becket<persname key="sbeck1"></persname></a>'s, who is a member

<p> Rode fifteen miles up the river to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">William
                        Lunday<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>'s. Left our horses there are walked about a <br/>mile
                    to a meeting appointed by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a> and <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wblak1">William Blakey<persname key="wblak1"></persname></a>, in a meeting-house near
                        <geogname key="niagf">the Falls</geogname>, <br/>called the Federal Meeting
                    House, it being built by <br/>the inhabitants for any minister of any religious
                    de-<br/> nomination to preach in, but I understand meetings <br/>are very rare
                    in it. No Friends live hereabouts but <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">William
                        Lunday<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>, and he, by some means, forfeited <br/>his right before he
                    came here, but is kind to us. I <br/>thought the opportunity was owned,
                    particularly to-<br/>ward the close. In the afternoon <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wblak1">William Blakey<persname key="wblak1"></persname></a>, <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan

                    set off for <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/blacc">Black Creek<placename key="blacc"></placename></a>; <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpaxs1">Jacob Paxson<persname key="jpaxs1"></persname></a> being very poorly, stayed <br/>at

                        Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a> and myself went about five <br/>miles down the river to
                    view a great curiosity called <br/>the whirlpool. On our way we met with an
                    acceptable <br/>repast on excellent peaches. We came to the bank of <br/> the
                    river, which I believe is three hundred feet above <br/>the water, nearly
                    perpendicular, on which we had <br/>a fair view of that astonishing place, the
                    river rush-<br/>ing with great impetuosity against the bank or wall <br/>of
                    rocks at a short turn in the river and then turning <br/>in a cove of perhaps
                    ten acres in which it whirls <br/>round and round, striving to escape at a
                    narrow pas-<br/>sage of perhaps one hundred yards, being all the <br/>opening
                    there is between the high hills. Into this <br/>pool abundance of logs and
                    timber is carried and per-<br/>haps cannot get out for some weeks. It is amazing
                    <br/>to behold the whirls that are formed, the logs sucked <br/>down and some
                    time after shooting up (perhaps 100 <br/> yards from the place they went down,
                    end foremost) <br/>fifteen or twenty feet perpendicular out of the water;
                    <br/>that upon the whole it is an indescribably agitated <br/>place. Returned
                    and lodged at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">William Lunday<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>'s.</p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">William Lunday<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a> accompanied <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a>
<br/>and myself in order to take a satisfactory view of the <br/>great cataract.
                    We went about three-quarters of a <br/>mile below <geogname key="niagf">the
                        Falls</geogname> and then descended a bank of <br/>lime-stone rocks, I
                    suppose nearly 300 feet, which <br/>was not quite perpendicular, to the surface
                    of the <br/>water, some times holding by roots, some times by <br/> twigs, and
                    some of the way down a ladder, other <br/>times sticking our toes in the
                    cavities and holding <br/>by the craggy parts of the rocks. When down,
                    clam-<br/>bered along the rocks, logs, slabs, and timber up the <br/>river to
                    the place where the water shoots over the <br/>rock and falls 160 feet. We went
                    as far as we though <br/>was safe, being as wet, with the spray of water and
                    <br/>sweat, as if we had been in a heavy shower. I had <br/> an inclination to
                    go further in behind the water, but <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">Lunday<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a> said it was dangerous; for, as he said, if the <br/>wind
                    were to shift against us we should be in danger <br/>of being suffocated with
                    the spray and sulphur which <br/>smelled very strong. I though there was not
                    quite <br/>so much danger as he alleged, believining he was a <br/>good deal
                    timid; however, I thought best to decline, <br/>lest I should suffer for my
                    temerity. On clambering <br/>along the rocks by the water with a wall or
                    mountain <br/> of rocks 160 feet high in some place over my head, <br/>hanging
                    twelve or fifteen feet over plumb, it appeared <br/>truly awful and dangerous,
                    which put me upon think-<br/>ing what my view was in going into such apparent
                    <br/> danger, as it is evident great columns of them fre-<br/>quently break off
                    and fall down; but as I believed it <br/>was not altogether to gratify an indle
                    curiosity, for the <br/>whole of the prospect led me into a reverent frame of
                    <br/>mind, admiring the wonderful works, and in some <br/>measure adoring the
                    Great Author, I then though if <br/>I should then be buried in oblivion, perhaps
                    my soul <br/>was as much in a state of aspiration and adoration as <br/> it
                    might be when the unavoidable event should take <br/>place. This consideration
                    led me on without much <br/>fear at that time, though naturally timid. I need
                    <br/>not undertake to describe this wonderful phenom-<br/>enon, as many pens
                    have been employed in setting <br/>forth its magnitude; but as I have taken a
                    view of <br/>the river in places many miles down, I am fully of <br/>the min
                    dthat the <geogname key="niagf">great Falls</geogname> at some period were nine
                    <br/> miles farther down the river and that they are gradu-<br/>ally wearing up,
                    and perhaps in time may drain the <br/>great <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogname>. It is wonderful to behold the agi-<br/>tation of the water
                    in the rapids above the falls and <br/>also below them, column after column
                    dashing <br/>against each other and rising a great height with <br/>such foaming
                    and confusion that the whole appears <br/>truly awful. We were very wet when we
                    left the <br/> place; got on our horses and rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/chipp1">Chippewa<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a>. Fed <br/>our horses and took a snatch ourselves, then
                    rode to <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/blacc">Black Creek settlement<placename key="blacc"></placename></a>,
                    twenty-four miles, and <br/>lodged at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/amorr1">Anna

<p> Attended the meeting at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ascho1">Asa Schooly<persname key="ascho1"></persname></a>'s, it
                    <br/>being large for that place. After meeting we had a <br/>conference with the
                    members of that meeting and laid <br/>before them the need we though they had of
                    a house <br/> to meet in, which they seemd spirited to build. On
                    <br/>considering their circumstances,--being most of them <br/>new settlers and
                    not in very affluent life,--we made <br/>them an offer of thirty dollars toward
                    purchasing <br/>materials; but they modestly declined accepting it, <br/>and
                    said they could do themselves. I have now pre-<br/>pared things in order to set
                    my face homewards to-<br/>morrow, which feels very pleasant.</p>

                    night, who with his valued <br/>wife, equipped us for our journey through the

                    put up our horses and waited until all the <br/>rest of our company came, which

<p> Set off from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">Elicot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a>'s, it having been a very
                    wet <br/>night and dull morning. Rode eighteen and one-half <br/>miles to where
                    there is a large new house building for <br/>a house of entertainment. Fed our
                    horses and dined <br/> on our own provisions. The land the most of this stage
                    <br/>an open plain full of lime-stone which doth not appear <br/>to me to be
                    very valuable, the grass and herbage of <br/>an inferior kind; some of the way
                    pretty good land <br/>covered with beech and sugar maple. From thence <br/>to
                        <geogname key="tonne">Tonawanda</geogname>, a large stream running into
                        <geogname key="lakeo">Lake On-<br/>tario</geogname>, 11 1/2 miles. Between
                    those places there is some <br/>excellent land covered with beech, sugar maple,
                    bass, <br/>black walnut, shell-bark, hickory, poplar, and divers <br/>other
                    sorts of timber. Just after we crossed the <br/>
<geogname key="tonne">Tonawanda</geogname> I rode a few rods to the left hand to
                    see <br/>the memorable and celebrated rock under which <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/clind1">Captain Lindley<persname key="clind1"></persname></a> and his men, about two years ago,
                    en-<br/> camped and lodged a very cold, wet night without <br/>fire; and just
                    after I got into the road again, had the <br/>mortification to lose a great part
                    of my horse-feed by <br/>means of the bag's coming untied and scattering on
                    <br/>the ground, which my mare may have cause to lament <br/>in this wilderness
                    country. Then rode eleven miles <br/>further to a small stream, struck up a fire
                    and lodged <br/>in the woods at the east end of the <geogname key="woakp">White
                        Oak Plains</geogname>, <br/>having passed over some very poor land, some
                    good, <br/>and a large plain pretty much without timber or luxu-<br/>riant
                    herbage. On our way this day we met many <br/>people moving from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bucks">Bucks county<placename key="bucks"></placename></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/jerse">the

                    amazing what numbers of people emi-<br/>grate from those two places over the
                        <geogname key="niagr">Niagara river</geogname>. <br/>Where we have pitched
                    our tent there are several <br/>other fires, at some of which are several
                    Indians <br/>out hunting. They have large bundles of skins. This <br/>day's
                    ride, forty-one miles.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1799-10-09">9th.</date>
<placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> Set off early and rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">Elicot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a>'s
                    store-house, <br/>thirteen miles, having an order from him to get any-<br/>thing
                    ourselves or horses stood in need of. This stage <br/>almost all the way
                    excellent limestone land covered <br/>with ash, beech, bass, sugar maple, etc.,
                    in abun-<br/>dance; a deep soil and not so broken with the rock <br/>nor yet so
                    dead a level as in some places, and is tol-<br/>erably well watered with lively
                    streams. Soon after <br/>I set off this morning, my mind became serene,
                    <br/>which led me into an humble state, and thankful-<br/>ness and gratitude to
                    Him who hath hitherto pre-<br/>served me and showered down many blessings and
                    <br/>favors upon me, ascended from my soul, accompanied <br/>with strong desires
                    that the rest of my time may be <br/>spent in a measure worthy of such favors.
                    From <br/>thence to two new taverns just by a large spring; <br/>seven miles of
                    this distance the land much as before, <br/> when we came to a creek running to
                    the left called <br/><geogname key="kitcr">Kittle Creek</geogname>, just at a
                    great fall over a large flat rock, <br/>called the <geogname key="buttf">Buttermilk Falls</geogname>, then immediately en-<br/>tered land of an
                    inferior quality, into a large road I <br/>suppose opened by the State of New
                    York, on which <br/>there are many new improvements. From thence <br/>to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/pars1">Parsons<persname key="pars1"></persname></a>'s on said road, being a new tavern;
                    pretty <br/>good accomodations; eleven miles. On the way we <br/>crossed the
                        <geogname key="genes2">Genesee river</geogname>, four miles form our
                    lodging, <br/>it being a large stream running into the lake. On <br/>the west
                    siade of said river there is a small Indian <br/>village on an extense of flat
                    or plain of very rich land <br/>covered with high grass, I suppose some
                    thousands of <br/>acres. This day's ride, thirty-six miles, in which space
                    <br/>we met fifteen or sixteen wagons with families and <br/>many other people
                    moving to Upper Canada. So great <br/>is the emigration to that government.</p>

<p> Rode ten miles along the aforesaid road <br/>which is at least 100 feet wide. I
                    was very much <br/>surprised to see the improvement which is made in <br/> this
                    new settled country, particularly along this road. <br/>I am informed it is but
                    ten years since it first began <br/>to be settled; and now there is not half a
                    mile with-<br/>out a house, and many of them very good ones--what <br/>may be
                    called elegant--many capital barns; a great <br/>deal of land is cleared and
                    there are very good cattle <br/>in the fields. The people principally emigrated
                    from <br/> the New England states, and this is a specimen of <br/>their
                    industry. When we had ridden ten miles from <br/>our lodging we parted,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan  Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James
                        Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a> and myself turning off the <br/>main road to the north in
                    order to pay a visit to <br/>some Friends who are settled at a place called
                        <geogname key="mudcr">Mud <br/> Creek</geogname>. The other friends all
                    propose to go directly <br/>home. We then rode eight miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jsmit1">Jacob Smith<persname key="jsmit1"></persname></a>'s; <br/>dined and rested the afternoon;
                    here we propose to <br/>lodge. The most of the way from the great road
                    <br/>here, appears to be a light, sandy land, thinly tim-<br/>bered and I think
                    may be called poor. About one <br/>mile before we came to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jsmit1">Smith<persname key="jsmit1"></persname></a>'s, we again came into <br/>rich beech and sugar maple
                    land. Our landlord doth <br/>not appear to be much polished, but I believe is
                    <br/>hearty in entertaining us in his way.</p>

<p> Rode from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jsmit1">Jacob Smith<persname key="jsmit1"></persname></a>'s seven miles to his
                    <br/>brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jsmit2">Jeremiah Smith<persname key="jsmit2"></persname></a>'s. When I came in
                    sight of <br/>the house, although the barn and farm looked well, <br/>yet the
                    house appeared so miserable I was ready to<br/>wish I had not come into those
                    parts; but in a little <br/>while after I entered my mind was saluted with
                    some-<br/>thing like "Peace be to this house," and I felt myself <br/>very happy
                    in company with the family, and believe <br/>that divers of them live near the
                    fountains of good. <br/>We stayed till evening and then rode two miles to
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/alaph1">Abraham Lapham<persname key="alaph1"></persname></a>' and lodged.</p>

<p> On viewing the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/alaph1">Lapham<persname key="alaph1"></persname></a>'s <br/>farm and things
                    about it, (though he lives in a very <br/>poor house) I was astonished to see
                    the improve-<br/>ment made in the time; he told me it was but four <br/>years
                    last spring since he began on it in the woods, <br/>and now he has more than one
                    hundred acres of land <br/>fenced in, fields and meadows all in, either with
                    grain <br/>or grass, and the most of it excellent. Has built a <br/>saw-mill and
                    has a dairy of cows so good that not-<br/>withstanding it hath been an
                    unfavorable season, <br/>they have made above two thousand lbs. of cheese;
                    <br/>and yet he appears with his precious wife to be well <br/>concerned
                    Friends, and is free to devote much of his <br/>time in the service of truth.
                    Truly in this far back <br/>settlement in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genec">Genesee
                        county<placename key="genec"></placename></a>, State of New York, <br/>the appearance of things is
                    comfortable, and affords <br/>an encouraging hope that if the few Friends here
                    set-<br/>tled improve as well and hold up so good a light in a <br/>religious
                    sense as they do in improving the wilder-<br/>ness country, they may yet become
                    as "a city set <br/>upon a hill that cannot be hid." Stayed all this day
                    <br/>with these our valued and kind friends; wrote a let-<br/>ter to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>, at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/oneid">Oneida<placename key="oneid"></placename></a>, and walked about <br/>viewing the improvements

                    in his house. In the evening,<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cmacu1">Caleb
                        Maccumber<persname key="cmacu1"></persname></a> and another friend came to see us, <br/>and we spent

                    <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode two miles to <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ncoms1">Nathan Comstock<persname key="ncoms1"></persname></a>'s,
                    where Friends' meeting is held, <br/>which was large this day for such a new
                    country. It<br/>was a favored meeting, in which the gospel was <br/>preached,
                    and near the close I could not feel easy <br/>without requesting an opportunity
                    with Friends, se-<br/>lected from others, which was readily compiled with, <br/>
                    wherein I endeavored to relieve myself of a heavy <br/>burden which I had
                    silently borned ever since I came <br/>into these parts, on account of such a
                    rapid increase <br/>of the abominable practice of distilling the precious <br/>
                    wheat into whiskey; and though I believe there are <br/>a few well concerned
                    Friends here, yet doubts ac-<br/>companied my mind that they were too easy about
                    <br/>the wickedness of such a perversion of the blessings <br/>of Divine
                    Providence; and I endeavored to put them <br/>upon nobly bearing a testimony
                    against it, and set <br/>the light upon the candlestick, believing that the
                    des-<br/>truction or salvation of their country very much de-<br/>pended upon
                    the conduct pursued in that respect. <br/>After dinner rode seven miles to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nherr1">Nathan Herring- ton<persname key="nherr1"></persname></a>'s, a kind man not
                    in membership, but a diligent <br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_17" n="531"></pb> attender of meetings, and there lodged,
                    having ridden <br/>ten miles this day.</p>
</div>
<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1799-10-14">14th</date>. <placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p> Rode five miles through rich land and new <br/>road. We came to a great road,
                    and as soon as we <br/>entered it we came in sight of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/canan">Canandaigua<placename key="canan"></placename></a>, a newly <br/>settled town containing nearly or
                    quite fifty houses. <br/>I was surprised to see such a place in this back
                    <br/>country. It stands on a beautifully elevated spot, <br/>the buildings
                    generally excellent, and divers of them <br/>would cut a very good figure on the
                    banks of the <br/>
<geogname key="schri">Schuylkill</geogname> for a country seat. The town
                    commands <br/>a pleasant prospect of a small lake about twenty <br/>miles long
                    and two or three wide. We rode round <br/>the lower end of the lake and crossed
                    the outlet; <br/>then rode nine miles to one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/egilb2">Gilbert<persname key="egilb2"></persname></a>'s tavern, a good <br/>stage for horses. Greater part of
                    said nine miles is <br/> very rich land, some of the timber more mixed with
                    <br/>hickory and oak than some other places; but gen-<br/>erally through this
                    country there is a great scarcity <br/> of mill seats or lively streams. Then to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tlee1">Thomas Lee<persname key="tlee1"></persname></a>'s, a kind man, his wife a
                    member of our society; <br/>seventeen miles. About midway of this stage we <br/>
                    passed <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpott1">Judge Potter<persname key="jpott1"></persname></a>'s house and farm. The
                    house is <br/>quite grand and magnificent, and was it one story <br/>higher
                    would cut no inconsiderable fiture in one of <br/> the most populous streets of
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>. About <br/>two miles beofre
                    we came to said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tlee1">Lee<persname key="tlee1"></persname></a>'s, we crossed a <br/>fine
                    stream running to the left, being the outlet of <br/><geogname key="crook">Crooked Lake</geogname>; and about one mile below the lake, <br/>at the
                    place we crossed said stream, there is a new <br/>mill and saw-mill which was
                    built by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/dwago1">David Wag-oner<persname key="dwago1"></persname></a>, one of the
                    followers of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwilk1">Jemima Wilkinson<persname key="jwilk1"></persname></a>, it <br/>being a
                    few miles from her residence. Our quarters <br/>for ourselves and horses at this
                    place are excellent; <br/>and being informed that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph
                        Jones<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a>, a young man <br/> brought up in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/yorkt">Yorktown<placename key="yorkt"></placename></a>, with whom I had some <br/>acquaintance, lived near, I
                    sent for him. He came<br/>and spent the evening very agreeably to us both, and
                    <br/> as there appeared to be a few Friends and some <br/>Friendly people in
                    this settlement besides some of <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwilk1">Jemima<persname key="jwilk1"></persname></a>'s
                    followers, who are very tired of their ad-<br/>herence, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a> felt a draft in his mind to <br/>have a meeting
                    appointed, which was accordingly <br/>done, to be held in the house where we
                    have put up, <br/>to begin to-morrow at eleven o'clock. This day's <br/>ride,
                    thirty-one miles.</p>

<div type="entry">

<p> Attended the appointed meeting, which was <br/>large considering the place, it
                    being a memorably <br/>favoured time, in which the gospel was preached in
                    <br/>demonstration of the spirit and with power, and I be-<br/>lieve many hearts
                    contrited, divers who had been <br/>and some who are adherents of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwilk1">Jemima<persname key="jwilk1"></persname></a>. After <br/>meeting walked home with
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph Jones<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a>; spent the <br/>afternoon
                    with him at his lodging where he has set <br/>up his trade at a mill known by
                    the name of the <br/>"Friends' Mill," but [which] is now private property,
                    <br/>and will, in time, I think, be of great value, the <br/>stream being large
                    and durable, and a fall over the <br/>rocks of forty feet, which completely
                    answer for a <br/> dam and head race for one grist mill, two saw mills, <br/>and
                    a fulling mill. Returned to lodge at the same <br/>place.</p>

<p> Set off early from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tlee1">Lee's<persname key="tlee1"></persname></a> and rode sixteen
                    <br/>miles till we came in sight of <geogname key="mudla">Mud Lake</geogname> to
                    our left <br/>hand. There <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/nsmit1">Nathan Smith<persname key="nsmit1"></persname></a>, and <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jhill1">John Hill<persname key="jhill1"></persname></a> went forward, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a> and my-<br/>self took a right-hand road
                    leading to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bath">Bath<placename key="bath"></placename></a>, and rode <br/>two miles to
                    one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/stan1">Stanford<persname key="stan1"></persname></a>'s, fed our horses, and dined.
                    <br/>Just before we came to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/stan1">Stanford<persname key="stan1"></persname></a>'s,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph Jones<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a> came <br/>up with us and
                    brought forward <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua Sharples<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a>'s
                    <br/>pocket-book, he having left and forgotten it at our <br/>lodging. Then
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jcoop1">James Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a> followed the others <br/>with
                    the pocket-book. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a> and I rode to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bath">Bath<placename key="bath"></placename></a>, <br/>fourteen miles. The first part
                    of this day's ride was <br/>chequered with good, bad, and middling land. About
                    <br/>seven or eight miles before we came to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bath">Bath<placename key="bath"></placename></a> we <br/>passed the upper end of <geogname key="crook">Crooked Lake</geogname>, it being about <br/>twenty miles long and about
                    three miles broad in the <br/>widest place. About two miles above the head of
                    <br/>the lake, tolerably good land with improvements; <br/>the rest of the way
                    to the town very poor land cov-<br/>ered with pitch pine. The town of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bath">Bath<placename key="bath"></placename></a> is hand-<br/>somely situated on the bank of a
                    branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Sus-<br/>quehanna</geogname> called

<p> Set off early from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wkers1">Kersey<persname key="wkers1"></persname></a>'s, accompanied
                    <br/>by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph Jones<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a>, and rode six miles to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdols1">Dolson<persname key="jdols1"></persname></a>'s, where <br/>the rest of our
                    company lodged, they being just gone <br/>when I arrived. I though they might
                    have stayed <br/>a little longer to acknowledge <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">Joseph<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a>'s kindness in <br/>following with the articles left
                    behind. Thence to the <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ppost">Painted Post<placename key="ppost"></placename></a>,
                    twelve miles; it being a noted place, I <br/> was disappointed in seeing the
                    house and entertain-<br/>ment. However, it was not so bad but it might be
                    <br/>worse. The most of this stage was very poor, rough land. <br/> Thence to
                    the tavern known by the name of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/linds">Lind-sley's<placename key="linds"></placename></a>; a good stage, twelve miles. Immediately after
                    <br/>leaving the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ppost">Painted Post<placename key="ppost"></placename></a>, crossed the
                        <geogname key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogname>, a large <br/>stream running into
                    the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>. We then rode up the <br/><geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>, a long, rich bottom, and crossed it twice
                    after <br/>leaving <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/linds">Lindsley's<placename key="linds"></placename></a>. Crossed the
                        <geogname key="cowan">Cowanesque</geogname> and the <br/><geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname> twice more before we arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/berr1">Berry<persname key="berr1"></persname></a>'s, where <br/> we lodged; ten miles. This day's
                    ride, forty miles.</p>

<p> From <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/berr1">Berry<persname key="berr1"></persname></a>'s to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/petec">Peter's
                        Camp<placename key="petec"></placename></a>, twenty-one <br/>miles still up the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>, and crossed it six time. <br/>Land and timber much as
                    before, except in many <br/> places very lofty white pine. On our way we fed at
                    <br/>one <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/whit1">White<persname key="whit1"></persname></a>'s, twelve miles from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/berr1">Berry<persname key="berr1"></persname></a>'s, a newly set-<br/>tled place, and appears as
                    though it may in time be <br/>good quarters. We have now ridden about forty-two
                    <br/>miles up the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga river</geogname>, and crossed it
                    ten times. <br/>Thence to the block-house, ten miles, where we fed <br/>and
                    parleyed a little about staying all night. Some <br/>were for lodgeing there,
                    but from the general account <br/>of the mischief done to travelers by the man
                    of the <br/>house or some of his family, I was all along uneasy <br/>to stay
                    there. The rest of my companions appearing <br/>disposed to stay, it being then
                    three o'clock in the <br/>afternoon, however at last I gave up to stay, and then
                    <br/>they changed their purpose and set off, and I with <br/> them, I feeling a
                    good deal unhappy at our entering <br/>a lonesome desert, not knowing whether we
                    should <br/>meet with any suitable place to encamp, and two of <br/>our company
                    being infirm. But on riding about <br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_18" n="532"></pb> three miles, we came to a stream of water
                    and there <br/>fixed things in order for lodging in the woods, which <br/>we got
                    completed before night; and had a comfort-<br/>able night under a tent made of
                    bushes, by a large <br/>fire. My companions said the place should be called
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/coatc">Coats's Camp<placename key="coatc"></placename></a>, which name I have no
                    doubt it will go <br/>by. From <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/petec">Peter's Camp<placename key="petec"></placename></a>
                    we immediately left the <geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>
<br/>on our left hand, and ascended a great mountain <br/>called the <geogname key="savmo">Savage Mountain</geogname>., which I take to be there <br/>same
                    range with the <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany</geogname> and <geogname key="laure">Laurel Hill</geogname>. It <br/>is a great height and breadth,
                    being twenty miles <br/>across the ascent, and on the top until we came to the
                    <br/>place we lodged, (which is thirteen or fourteen miles), <br/>to the worst
                    road I have met with on this side the <br/><geogname key="genes2">Genesee
                        river</geogname>, being very stony, rooty, and muddy; a <br/>great part of
                    it covered with hemlock.</p>

<p> The descent down the south side pretty good <br/>road, but steep until we came
                    to <geogname key="trout">Trout Run</geogname>, nine <br/>miles from the
                    block-house, then down said run <br/>six miles, in which distance we crossed it
                    twenty-seven <br/>or twenty-eight times, and came to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/creed1">Charles Reeder<persname key="creed1"></persname></a>'s. <br/>Got oats and fed our horses, then left
                    the main road, <br/>crossed the <geogname key="lycom">Lycoming</geogname> and
                    went seven miles over <br/>very poor, rough land to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mwils1">Moses
                        Wilson<persname key="mwils1"></persname></a>'s, a Friend at <br/>a place called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/bloom">Blooming Grove<placename key="bloom"></placename></a>. Dined and proposed <br/>to stay all night. Rode

<p> First of the week. Rode two miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/npear1">Na-thaniel
                        Pearson<persname key="npear1"></persname></a>'s where a small meeting of Friends <br/>is held by
                    indulgence on the First- day of the week. <br/>Sat with them in their meeting
                    and went home with <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mstar1">Moses Starr<persname key="mstar1"></persname></a> to dine. Afternoon rode seven
                    miles to <br/>the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wharr1">widow Harris<persname key="wharr1"></persname></a>'s. The land and
                    timber this day's <br/>ride, which was nine miles, appeared to me to be
                    <br/>very poor until we came to the said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wharr1">Harris<persname key="wharr1"></persname></a>'s, on the <br/> west branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, where there appears <br/>to be excellent land a
                    considerable width from the <br/>river, and they have an extraordinary
                    plantation for <br/>fertility with a beautiful descent from the house fac-<br/>
                    ing the south. On taking a view of said farm and <br/>the buildings upon it, I
                    was led to contemplate upon <br/>the great difference between the New England
                    set-<br/>tlers in a new country and those from Maryland, <br/>having heretofore
                    mentioned the industry, economy, <br/>and intrepidity of the former. This family
                    emigat-<br/>ted from Maryland and appears in the house hold to <br/> be in
                    affluent circumstances. Several sons, young <br/>men grown, and have been
                    settled here, I suppose, <br/>twelve or fourteen years; have got a good deal of
                    <br/>excellent land, cleared perhaps by the blacks, but <br/>they have no barn
                    nor stable fit to put a horse into; <br/>but have ten or twelve hounds, a tame
                    wolf, etc., and <br/>I expect spend much of their time in hunting; all of
                    <br/>which had a tendency to increase my partiality in <br/> favor of the
                    Yankees. But we are kindly enter-<br/>tained here; therefore it will not be
                    proper to cast<br/>any reflections on their economy.</p>

                    a great deal of <br/>what I call poor mountain land, covered with barren

                    <br/>months past felt my mind drawn to visit them again <br/>in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/cornp">Cornplanter's settlement<placename key="cornp"></placename></a>, and where some of our
                    <br/>young men are residing amonst the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca
                        Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>, <br/>at a place called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, in order to instruct <br/>them. The committee,
                    last month in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>
<br/>when met, believed it would be likely to be useful in <br/> promoting that
                    good work, for four Friends to be ap-<br/>pointed to visit the before-mentioned
                    settlement this <br/>season; accordingly separated <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">Isaac

                    <br/>purpose. We then agreed to meet at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tligh1">Thomas
                        Light-foot<persname key="tligh1"></persname></a>'s, at <geogname key="maide">Maiden

<p> The morning of said day I left home in company <br/>with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jwils1">James Wilson<persname key="jwils1"></persname></a>, who is intending to accompany <br/>some women
                    Friends to Upper or West Canada, in <br/>order to visit the members of our
                    Society residing <br/>there. About noon we met <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">Isaac
                        Bonsal<persname key="ibons1"></persname></a> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jscar1">John Scarlet<persname key="jscar1"></persname></a>'s
                    and arrived in the evening at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tligh1">Thomas

                    to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta">Catawissa<placename key="catta"></placename></a>, 23 miles, this morning before

                    ridden ninety-six miles. We propose <br/> to rest the remainder of this day at

                    think it need-<br/>less to make any observations, finding them all to <br/>very
                    nearly correspond with the former notes I made <br/>thereon; but have observed a
                    number of miles back to <br/> this place, the Indian corn, buckwheat, potatoes,
                    and <br/>almost all other tender vegtables are generally killed <br/>with the

<p> Our expected company all arrived last even-<br/>ing. In the morning provided

                    Soon <br/>after we crossed the northeast branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Susque-<br/>hanna</geogname> we found the frost had not been so severe as
                    <br/>where we passed yesterday; but it is almost melan-<br/>choly to behold in
                    this part of the country the springs <br/>and streams of water to be almost
                    wholly dried up <br/>and gone, even many heretofore large streams with <br/>no
                    water in them, and many valuable milles are with-<br/>out one drop, insomuch
                    that divers of the inhabitants <br/>have got to boiling their wheat to eat and
                    expect if <br/>the drough continues much longer it will be gener-<br/>ally the

<p> A wet morning. We stayed at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/welli1">Wm. Ellis<persname key="welli1"></persname></a>'s
                    <br/>and dined. About two o'clock p. m., <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas

                    fifteen miles <br/>to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newbe1">Newberry<placename key="newbe1"></placename></a>, a small town
                    of perhaps fifteen or <br/>twenty houses. Most or all of the way from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/welli1">Ellis<persname key="welli1"></persname></a>'s to <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newbe1">Newberry<placename key="newbe1"></placename></a> is a beautiful road along the
                    bottom lying <br/>on the west branch of <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>. On our way we <br/>crossed the <geogname key="loyal">Loyalsock</geogname> about nine miles from our last <br/>night's
                    lodging, and the <geogname key="lycom">Lycoming</geogname> about six miles
                    <br/>farther, near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newbe1">Newberry<placename key="newbe1"></placename></a>, both of which
                    are large, <br/>beautiful streams falling into the <geogname key="westb">West

                    is very <br/>fertile although it appears to be sandy. Near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/lycom1">Lycom-ing<placename key="lycom1"></placename></a> the Indian corn is excellent; I
                    expect it will pro-<br/>duce fifty bushels to the acre. We propose to lodge
                    <br/>to-night at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jsloa2">John Sloan<persname key="jsloa2"></persname></a>'s tavern where we
                    have had <br/> an excellent supper. We passed through <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/willi2">Williams-port<placename key="willi2"></placename></a>, about three miles back from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/newbe1">Newberry<placename key="newbe1"></placename></a>, it being <br/>the county town of Lycoming

<p> Rode eighteen miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jkook1">James Kooken<persname key="jkook1"></persname></a>'s on
                        <br/><geogname key="larcr">Larrie's Creek</geogname>, and dined. The most of
                    the way over<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_20" n="547"></pb> a very rough mountain called the
                        <geogname key="allmo">Alleghany</geogname>; some <br/>spots tolerable land,
                    but I think four-fifths of it is not <br/>worth settling upon. Just before we
                    came to the <br/>creek we entered a forest of very tall white pine <br/>which
                    stands very close together, insomuch that I con-<br/>cluded if it was all cut up
                    in four-foot lengths it could <br/> not be corded on the ground. Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jkook1">Kooken<persname key="jkook1"></persname></a> has <br/>about fifteen acres of land cleared,
                    which appears to <br/>be very fertile, having very luxuriant potatoes and
                    <br/>butterweeds, also the appearance of good oats standing <br/>in shock and
                    some not cut. Thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jnorr1">John Norris<persname key="jnorr1"></persname></a>'s
                    <br/>mill, on a branch of <geogname key="pinec">Pine Creek</geogname>, thirteen
                    miles. After <br/>leaving <geogname key="larcr">Larrie's Creek</geogname> we
                    rode about five miles <br/>through very rich land exceeding heavy loaded with
                    <br/>timber--mostly white pine with some hemlock, sugar <br/>maple, etc., and
                    then entered a valley down which a <br/>branch of <geogname key="pinec">Pine
                        Creek</geogname> runs, which we crossed eleven <br/>times, and then came
                    upon a larger branch of said <br/>water, crossing it several times. Up to the
                    mill pretty <br/>good land in a narrow valley between two high <br/>mountains;
                    no house nor improvement for ten miles <br/>of the last stage. At this place we
                    have got a very<br/>pleasant landlady who provided us a good supper.</p>

                    <br/>miles; the most of the way upon a branch of <geogname key="pinec">Pine

                    and there appears to be several new settle-<br/>ments making which in tim may be
                    very valuable, <br/>one of which is <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sbabs1">Sampson
                        Babs<persname key="sbabs1"></persname></a>'s who is making an <br/>improvement on a fertile spot and
                    has got a race al-<br/>most finished in order for a sawmill, and perhaps <br/>a
                    grist mill. He appeared exceedingly elevated <br/>with seeing us and told us
                    when he came there <br/>first, being no road, he came by direction of a
                    <br/>compass, and resided twelve weeks without see-<br/>ing the face of any
                    person. Had only a blanket <br/>and piece of hemlock bark for his house and
                    bed-<br/>clothing. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mwils1">Moses Wilson<persname key="mwils1"></persname></a> and his truly
                    valuable wife <br/>appear to be very happy in seeing us. He has made <br/>a
                    considerable opening in the heavy timber and has <br/>got good corn and other
                    things; but truly those who <br/>have not been in the back country can have but
                    a <br/>very imperfect idea of the hardship and difficulty <br/>those have to
                    endure or encounter who are the first <br/>settlers in a new country. Thence to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jmill1">James Mills<persname key="jmill1"></persname></a>'s at <br/>the third fork of
                        <geogname key="pinec">Pine Creek</geogname>, which is a boatable <br/>
                    stream about fifty-six miles above where it empties <br/>into the west branch of

                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mwils1">Moses Wilson<persname key="mwils1"></persname></a>'s. On our way we came to a
                    camp <br/> in the woods, where we foudn <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/welli1">Wm.
                        Ellis<persname key="welli1"></persname></a> with a <br/>Fisher &amp; Co.'s land, said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/welli1">Ellis<persname key="welli1"></persname></a> accompanying us <br/>six miles to said
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jmill1">Mills<persname key="jmill1"></persname></a>'s in order to spend the <br/>
                    evening with us in friendly converse. The land gen-<br/>erally good this stage,
                    and some of it excellent with<br/>abundance of very large sugar maple. Said
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jmill1">Mills<persname key="jmill1"></persname></a> is <br/> living on said Fisher's
                    land which I think will, in time, <br/>be a very valuable estate. He said he had
                    two years <br/>ago six hundred dozen of wheat, and the present <br/>year has got
                    seventeen acres of corn, which will no <br/>doubt yield fifty or sixty bushels
                    to the acre; appears <br/>to be a very active, intelligent man; has got twelve
                    <br/>children, nine of whom live with him, who are <br/>very healthy and hardy.
                    He is perhaps as successful <br/> a hunter as there is in this State, and many
                    of the <br/>wild beasts of the woods fall a prety to his skill, such <br/>as
                    bears, panthers, elk, and deer. It is said and be-<br/>lieved he killed eleven
                    elk one morning before break-<br/>fast. One of his sons, in the ninth year of
                    his age, <br/>killed six elk and five deer; is now in the fourteenth <br/>year
                    of his age, has killed several bears this season. <br/>Two of his daughters
                    killed three elk in one day; <br/> and we have this evening feasted on the
                    product of <br/>their skill. Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jmill1">Mills<persname key="jmill1"></persname></a> told
                    me that he and one other <br/>man were out about a week and they killed in that
                    <br/>time above seventy deer.</p>

                    <br/>of which we had plenty, wheat bread and butter, <br/>venison, both of the
                    elk and common deer, eels, trout, <br/>then rode about twenty-five miles up
                        <geogname key="pinec">Pine Creek</geogname>, and <br/> crossed it
                    thirty-eight times before we came to the <br/>head, which is about eighty miles

<p> Rode twenty-three miles to a new settlement <br/>on <geogname key="osweo">Osweo</geogname> being one of the main branches of the <br/>aforesaid
                    river, where there are several neat houses <br/>built, which is intended for a
                    town called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ceres">Cerestown<placename key="ceres"></placename></a>
<br/>or Francis King's settlement. The most of the said <br/>twenty-three miles
                    is excellent land, but so heavy <br/>loaded with timber of divers sorts, such as
                    hemlock, <br/>white pine, sugar maple, cherry, and some bass or <br/>lynn, that
                    it will be very expensive clearing. It is <br/>astonishing to see the height of
                    the white pine, and <br/>other timber in proportion. Although to such as
                    <br/>have never seen such timber it may seem a little <br/>romantic, I have
                    seen, (particularly when we came <br/>near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ceres">Francis
                        King's<placename key="ceres"></placename></a>), great numbers of trees which <br/>we all believe to be
                    thirteen or fourteen perches <br/>high; and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jbell1">John
                        Bell<persname key="jbell1"></persname></a>, a Friend of veracity, told us he <br/> measured one which
                    was 250 feet long when it fell <br/>down, which is fifteen perches and ten feet.
                    Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jbell1">Bell<persname key="jbell1"></persname></a>
<br/>and his wife are Friends that came from the north of <br/>England, and are
                    about settling here; [they have] a <br/> good deal of very good corn; they seem
                    to be in good <br/>spirits, were truly glad to see us, his wife remarkably
                    <br/>so, insomuch that she was ready to weep with joy; <br/>is a remarkably
                    cleanly woman and was very happy <br/>this afternoon in entertaining us with a
                    good cup of <br/>tea sweetened with loaf sugar and good will, that I <br/>though
                    the joy and happiness we were instrumental <br/>in communicating to this woman
                    was almost worth <br/>our journey to these parts. Here we also met with <br/> my
                    old friend, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Halftown<persname key="halft1"></persname></a>, who is up here in a
                    canoe <br/>with three of his children, in order to get some <br/>necessary
                    tools, etc.; was just going to set off about <br/>fifty miles down the river to
                    his home. He was very <br/>much rejoiced to see us and agreed to stay until
                    to-<br/>morrow to navigate us down the river to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Gene-singuhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>.</p>

<p> First of the week. Stayed at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ceres">Cerestown<placename key="ceres"></placename></a> till
                    <br/>after dinner. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fking1">Francis King<persname key="fking1"></persname></a> is a plain, sober-looking<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_21" n="548"></pb> man, but by some means he forfeited his
                    right of <br/>membership with our Society before he left England. <br/>His wife
                    died after he came here, leaving with him <br/>seven or eight children who are
                    members. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jbell1">John<persname key="jbell1"></persname></a>
<br/>and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mbell1">Mary Bell<persname key="mbell1"></persname></a> with six or seven children
                    are all <br/>members. These two families with one or two more, <br/>are in the
                    commendable practice of meeting together <br/>once or twice a week in order to
                    pay the tribute <br/>of worship. We sat with them in their little meet-<br/>ing
                    and dined at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jbell1">John Bell<persname key="jbell1"></persname></a>'s, whose wife is a
                    woman <br/>of the most exquisite sensibility; and at our depart-<br/>ure taking
                    leave of them [it] seemed as much as she <br/>could bear with becoming
                    fortitude. After dinner, <br/>walked along with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Halftown<persname key="halft1"></persname></a> down the <geogname key="osweo">Osweo</geogname> six
                    <br/>miles, where it empties into the <geogname key="alleg">Alleghany</geogname>, and he <br/>had left his canoe. The water being very low,
                    some <br/>of us walked and others rode in the canoe turn about <br/>until we
                    reached <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahoop1">Adam Hoopes<persname key="ahoop1"></persname></a>'s, fourteen miles from
                        <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fking1">King<persname key="fking1"></persname></a>'s. The land and timber down the
                    river to here, <br/>pretty good. Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahoop1">Hoopes<persname key="ahoop1"></persname></a>
                    received us very kindly in <br/>his cabin and treated us with the best provision
                    he <br/> had; which was venison, [and] corn, dried, pounded, <br/>and made into
                    mush, with milk to eat with it. We <br/>all slept on the floor of his cabin
                    before the fire, hav-<br/>ing some of his poultry taking their repose close by
                    <br/>us. He is a courteous man who owns 20,000 acres of <br/>land in this
                    country, a considerable part of which is <br/>very good, and is now beginning a
                    settlement just at <br/>the mouth of a boatable stream called <geogname key="issua">Issua</geogname>, which <br/>perhaps in time may become a very
                    valuable estate. <br/>He has got a large house raised but not covered, and
                    <br/>some corn standing, and perhaps eight or ten acres <br/>which he intends to
                    sow wheat upon.</p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ahoop1">Adam Hoops<persname key="ahoop1"></persname></a>'s brother pro-<br/> posing to go to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> to get some seed wheat,
                    <br/>and the river being so low that we were doubtful <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Halftown<persname key="halft1"></persname></a> would be beset to convey us down in his
                    ca-<br/>noe, they kindly offered some of us a passage in their <br/>canoe.
                    Accordingly <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoe-maker<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a>, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">George Vaux<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> went with him, he having <br/>two active young men
                    to work it; and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">Isaac Bonsal<persname key="ibons1"></persname></a>
<br/>and myself took passage with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/halft1">Halftown<persname key="halft1"></persname></a> and
                    his son, <br/> having an exceedingly pleasant ride down the river, <br/>keeping
                    in company all the way with the vessel <br/>which our friends were on board of,
                    and another <br/> canoe with one man in it going to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/pitts">Pittsburg<placename key="pitts"></placename></a>. We <br/>sometimes sat up and sometimes lay down and
                    slept <br/>between two Indians navigating us, who appeared <br/>very dexterous,
                    and disposed to accommodate us in <br/> every respect in their power. About
                    twelve or fifteen <br/>miles down from the <geogname key="issua">Issua</geogname> we stopped and dined at a<br/>place called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/plumo">Plum-Orchard<placename key="plumo"></placename></a>, it being on or near <br/>the upper end
                    of the Indian reserve. I never saw <br/> such a place before, it containing
                    about forty or fifty <br/>acres of exceeding rich land thickly set with trees
                    <br/>which are loaded with excellent fruit, and abundance <br/>on the ground,
                    now in full season. I have no doubt <br/>but there is more than one hundred
                    cart-loads of ex-<br/>cellent plums on which we satiated our appetites for <br/>
                    that fruit and took some on board. Then sailed down <br/>the river to the mouth
                    of the <geogname key="tusqu">Tusquiatossy</geogname>, it being twen-<br/>ty-one
                    miles from <geogname key="issua">Issua</geogname>. There we struck up a fire,
                    <br/>pitched our tents and slept on the river-bank, the <br/>number of the
                    passengers our squadron contained be-<br/>ing twelve. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">George Vaux<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> hitherto being our cook hath <br/> performed his
                    office to suit our palates, and this even-<br/>ing failed not in his skill. In
                    the night an alarm was <br/>sounded in our camp by a sentinel, under an
                    appre-<br/>hension of the near approach of a mortal enemy. <br/>One of our
                    company took the alarm and immediately <br/> rose; the others believing it to be
                    the effect of imag-<br/>ination did not think it necessary to get up, which
                    <br/>ultimately proved to be the case.</p>

<p> Breakfasted early and pursued our voyage <br/>four miles to the mouth of
                        <geogname key="tusqu">Tusquiatossy</geogname>, being a <br/>creek (though
                    now quite dry) that runs down what <br/> is called the <geogname key="lvall">Little Valley</geogname>. Thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, <br/>where we met with our beloved friends,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">J. Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jthom2">J.
                        Thomas<persname key="jthom2"></persname></a>, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jswai1">J. Swayne<persname key="jswai1"></persname></a>, the
                    young men whom we <br/>stationed there in order to improve the natives,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpenn1">John  Pennock<persname key="jpenn1"></persname></a> also being there some
                    time, improving some <br/>of them in the smith- business. It was truly a very
                    <br/>satisfactory meeting, particularly to them, they being <br/>so long from a
                    sense of duty separated from their <br/>friends and relatives. Many of the
                    Indians came to <br/>see us this afternoon and took us by the hand with
                    <br/>evident tokens of great joy, which is a clear indica-<br/> tion that they
                    are highly pleased with, and in good <br/>measure sensible of our disinterested
                    endeavor to <br/>improve them in agriculture, mechanical arts, and
                    <br/>profitable civilization. We observed, as we sailed <br/>down, the Indian
                    reserve of land along the river to <br/>be excellent; and when we came within
                    fourteen or <br/>fifteen miles of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, the settlements and<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_23" n="563"></pb> improvements began to appears, and many
                    of the In-<br/>dians have begun to clear out and cultivate their <br/>ground;
                    have built houses more comfortable than<br/>they were formerly accustomed to.
                    When I was up <br/>the river from this place four years ago, I believe
                    <br/>there were but three or four settlements worth <br/>noticing; and now there
                    are eighteen or nineteen, <br/>and divers of them have large fields of corn,
                    con-<br/>siderable stock of cattle, and some of them this sea-<br/>son had wheat
                    for sale; so that upon the whole I <br/> think they have improved in agriculture
                    beyond my <br/>expectations. Soon after we arrived, our friends <br/>showed us
                    the copy of a speech made by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>
<br/> and his brother, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/conud1">Conudiu<persname key="conud1"></persname></a>, on the
                    proposal of their <br/>moving off the Indians' land and settling near them
                    <br/>where they might have the opportunity of being in-<br/>structed as usual
                    and building a saw-mill, which is as <br/>follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/conud1">Conudiu<persname key="conud1"></persname></a> first spoke: </p>

<p> It is now a long time since <br/>you came to live amongst us; it have
                            even exceeded <br/>the limits that were first proposed. I now speak the
                            <br/>united voice of our cheifs and warriors to you, our <br/> women
                            also, and all our people. Attend, therefore, <br/>to what I say. We wish
                            you to make your minds <br/>perfectly easy; we are all pleased with your
                            living <br/>amongst us, and not one of us wants you to leave our <br/>
                            country. We find no fault with you in any respect <br/>since you came
                            among us, neither have we anything <br/>to charge you with. You have
                            lived peaceably and <br/>honestly with us, and have been preserved in
                            health,<br/>and nothing has befallen you. This we think is proof
                            <br/>that the Great Spirit also is pleased with your living <br/>here
                            and with what you have done for us.</p>
<p> Friends, Tewenstee, we have been very much en-<br/>gaged in business
                            respecting the affairs of our na-<br/>tion, which has prevented us from
                            answering you <br/>proposals of declining the settlement at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>
<br/>and moving up the river to settle on land of your <br/> own joining
                            ours. We now all agree to leave you at <br/>full liberty either to
                            remain where you now are on our <br/>land, or to move up the river and
                            settle, on land of <br/>you own--only that you settle near us. The
                                <geogname key="lvall">Little <br/>Valley</geogname> is as far up the
                            river as our people are willing <br/>you should go, as we want you to be
                            near us, that you <br/> may extend further assistance and instruction;
                            for <br/>although we have experienced much benefit from <br/>you, and
                            some of our people have made considerable <br/>advancement in the
                            knowledge of useful labor, yet <br/>we remain very deficient in many
                            things, num-<br/>bers of us are yet poor.</p>
<p> Friends, Tewenstee, I myself have been advising <br/>our people to
                            pursue the course of life you recom-<br/>mend to us, and we have fully
                            concluded to follow <br/>habits of industry; but we are only just
                            beginning to <br/>learn, and we find ourselves at a loss for tools to
                            work <br/>with. We now request you to bring on plenty of <br/>all kinds
                            you think will be useful; then such of our <br/>people as are able will
                            buy for themselves, and such <br/>as are poor we wish you to continue to
                            lend to, and <br/>they shall be returned to you again. We also want
                            <br/>you to bring useful cloths and sell to us, that we may <br/>get
                            some necessary things without having to go so far <br/>for them. In
                            looking forward we can limit no time <br/>for you to live beside us;
                            this must depend on your <br/>own judgment. When your friends come from

                            communicate this speech to <br/>them as the full result of our minds
                            concerning you.</p>

<p> Friends, Tewenstee, attend. I will add a little <br/>further. When I was
                            in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Phildelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a>, a long time <br/>ago,
                            the Indians and white people at that time con-<br/>tinued to kill each
                            other; I then heard of Quakers, <br/> that they were a peaceable people,
                            and would not <br/>fight or kill anybody. I inquired of the President
                            <br/>of the United States about them, whether or not this <br/>account
                            was true. He said it was true enough; they <br/> were such a people. I
                            then requested him to send <br/>some of them to live amonst the Indians,
                            expecting <br/>they would be very useful to us. Then it was a long
                            <br/>time after before you came. You are now here, and <br/> it has
                            afforded me much satisfaction that you have <br/>come. I have not been
                            disappointed in the account <br/>I heard of you. You have lived
                            peacefully among us, <br/>and no difficulty has happened between you and
                            our <br/>people. We now want you to stay with us and stand <br/>between
                            us and the white people; and if you see any <br/>of them trying to cheat
                            us let us know of it; or if you <br/>see any of our people trying to
                            cheat the white we <br/>wish you to let it be known also, as we confide
                            in you<br/>that you will not cheat us.</p>
<p> "Friends, we have now spoken so full on the busi-<br/>ness that we need
                            not say any more until we find one <br/>of you has killed one of our
                            people, and we find him <br/>lying dead on the ground, or until one of
                            us kills one <br/>of you; then we will take up the business again."
                            [De-<br/> livered the <date when="1803-08-30">30th of the 8th month,
                                1803</date>.]</p>
</floatingtext>
<p> Notwishstanding this, we thought it necessary to <br/>see the chiefs and others
                    in council; and being in-<br/>formed that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> was just set out on a hunt-<br/>ing tour, we hired
                    an Indian to go in the night, (though <br/>it was a wet one), in quest of him.
                    He set out and <br/> traversed the woods, blowing his horn; and just at
                    <br/>daybreak found him, who came to us early this morn-<br/>ing which is the
                        <date when="1803-09-21">21st</date>, and 4th of the week. After
                    <br/>conferring with him, he appeared very much pleased <br/>with our coming,
                    and agreed to send out for the dis-<br/>tant chiefs and others to meet us in
                    council at this <br/>place next Seventh- day morning. We then set off up<br/>the
                    river in order to look for a suitable place to maek <br/>a settlement and build
                    a saw-mill. Having viewed <br/>two valleys heretofore had in view, but found the
                    <br/> streams entirely dried up, we came to a fine stream <br/>on the east side
                    of the river, called <geogname key="tunes">Tunesasau</geogname>, on <br/>which
                    we think there is a good mill-seat, being about <br/>three and a half miles from
                    this place, and land tol-<br/>erably good; then returned. On our way we had the
                    <br/>curiosity to ascend a very high mountain in order to <br/>have a prospect
                    of the river and adjacent country. <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> and myself pursued our <br/>route until we got a grand
                    prospect of the river and <br/>the adjacent country and a number of the Indian
                    set-<br/>tlements, and got home as soon as the others. The <br/>young Indian who
                    is the smith at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>,<br/>whose name
                    is <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/lhalf1">Levi Halftown<persname key="lhalf1"></persname></a>, went with us and re-<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_24" n="564"></pb> turned with those who gave out; he made
                    himself <br/>very merry with us when walking through the woods; <br/>said the
                    Quakers were like little children learning to <br/>walk, and that we might now
                    see some of the hard-<br/>ships the Indians had to pass through in their
                    hunt-<br/>ing, only that it would not dor for them to stop and <br/>rest; but
                    when he found I went on, said there was <br/>one hardy man amongst them. I think
                    I never heard <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a> complain or give out until
                    this <br/>time. In the evening <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/eblue1">Blue Eyes<persname key="eblue1"></persname></a> came;
                    was very <br/>glad to see us, but was sorry he had to go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta1">Catta-raugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a> to see a sick daughter, so that
                    he could not be <br/>at the council. Because he is a steady friend and pro-<br/>
                    moter of our concern for the good of the natives, be-<br/>ng a chief who both by
                    precept and example endeav-<br/>ors to lead them on in habits of sobriety and
                    indus-<br/>try, and as he could not stay with us, we took the op-<br/>ortunity
                    of opening to him some of the reasons of <br/>our coming here at this time,
                    which was a proposal <br/>of our young men's moving off their land and
                    set-<br/>tling near them on some of their own. He was wise <br/>enough to see
                    the reason of the proposal; and al-<br/>though he saw and gave in to the
                    propriety of it, yet <br/>appeared sorry, and he is a near neighbor; and said if
                    <br/>they moved he would wait to see how they would do <br/>and then move near
                    them. Truly the opportunity <br/>this evening with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/eblue1">Blue
                        Eyes<persname key="eblue1"></persname></a> had a tendency to pro-<br/>duce some very pleasant
                    sensations in my mind, and <br/>I thought I could own him for, and really felt
                    him <br/>near, as a brother.</p>

<p> Fifth of the week. This being the day on <br/>which the young men hold their
                    meeting, we sat with <br/>them, which I believe was a time of refreshment to
                    <br/>us all. In the afternoon walked about viewing the <br/> improvements the
                    Indians ahve made which are con-<br/>siderable. Several of them have a good deal
                    of corn, <br/>and some have raised some wheat; but I think they <br/>have not
                    improved in agriculture and industry equal <br/>to those up the river. We saw
                    two of them threshing<br/>their wheat; but as they had not barn to put it in, it
                    <br/>appeared to be somewhat damaged in the stack. I <br/>endeavored to put them
                    upon building barns, which <br/>they promised to do.</p>

<p> We all in company with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpenn1">John Pennock<persname key="jpenn1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jswai1">Joel
                        Swayne<persname key="jswai1"></persname></a>, went down to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesing-uhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>, or Cornplanter's Village, nine and a half
                    miles. <br/>Being eight of us having three horses, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>
<br/>and myself walked all the way and back again, being <br/> nineteen miles.
                    The others rode turn about. We ar-<br/>rived at the village about eleven o'clock
                    and spent <br/>two or three hours in viewing the Indians' houses,
                    <br/>corn-fields, and other improvements; and although <br/> we discovered
                    fourteen shingled houses and abund-<br/>ance of corn, yet I think they have not
                    improved <br/>four years past, equal to the Indians up the river. We <br/>dined
                    at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>'s upon the best venison I have
                    <br/>eaten since I left home, Indian bread, butter, butter-<br/>milk, bears' fat
                    and squashes. Some of our company <br/>were very desirous to return before
                    dinner; but <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> told them it
                    would not do. They then sum-<br/>moned all the fortitude they could and sat down
                    to <br/>dinner. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpenn1">John Pennock<persname key="jpenn1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jswai1">Joel
                        Swayne<persname key="jswai1"></persname></a>, <br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>,
                    and myself at with good-will; <br/>the others did as well as they could. The old
                    chief <br/>was very pleasant with us and made himself very <br/>cheerful,
                    inquiring for <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/hsimm1">Henry Simmons<persname key="hsimm1"></persname></a>; said he was <br/>
                    a man for his mind, and if he had not been a Quaker <br/>he would have made a
                    very good war chief. Some <br/>time after dinner, we returned. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">J. Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas
                        Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">Isaac Bonsal<persname key="ibons1"></persname></a>,
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">George Vaux<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> and myself <br/>walked one or
                    two miles near the river bank; the <br/>other three rode. On our way passed
                    through abun-<br/>dance of good corn and beans, and by eight or ten <br/>
                    houses, some of them very complete work, with stone <br/>chimneys. In one of
                    them lives an old woman, half-<br/>sister of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, with three or four sons. The <br/>poor old woman
                    was rejoiced to see us; said she was <br/>thankful to the Good Spirit for
                    preserving us in our <br/>long journey to see them, and also that He put it in
                    <br/>our hearts to have compassion on them; and that she<br/>was old and did not
                    expect to be at the council to-<br/>morrow, but hoped the Good Spirit would
                    preserve <br/>us. Truly the manner of her expression, the tears <br/>standing in
                    her eyes, and the whole of her deport-<br/>ment, expression, and appearance had
                    a tendency to <br/>enliven the affectionate feelings of my heart, and I
                    <br/>could not help thinking she was as much the favorite <br/> of Him who sees
                    not as man sees, as many who think <br/>themselves more polished. In about three
                    miles' <br/>walking, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a>, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/conud1">Conudiu<persname key="conud1"></persname></a>, and about twenty or <br/> thirty more of
                    the Indians overtook us on their way <br/>up to the council. I walked very
                    pleasantly and cheer-<br/>fully with them. The old chief, Cornplanter, wanted
                    <br/>me to ride his horse; but when I refused, he said I <br/>was a sachem.</p>

<p>Our friends who live amongst you inform us they have<br/>conferred with
                            you some time past about removing to set-<br/>tle some distance farther
                            up the river, on some of the land<br/>you lately sold to the white
                            people; which we understand<br/>they and some of you think might enable
                            them to be still<br/>more useful to you than where they now live.</p>
<p>"Brothers, we are desirous every movement we make<br/>amongst you may be
                            well considered and so conducted as<br/>to always keep the chain of
                            friendship clean and bright<br/>between us; for which reason we think it
                            right at this<br/>time to send some of our brethren to help to consult
                            and<br/> confer on this business, and our friends <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/icoat1">Isaac Coates,<persname key="icoat1"></persname></a><br/>

<p>"Brothers, our hearts are made glad to hear from our<br/>friends amongst
                            you that you are beginning to live more<br/>comfortably on the fruits of
                            your labor, under the blessing<br/>of the Good Spirit; and we more
                            especially rejoice to hear<br/>that your chiefs and young men generally
                            refrain from<br/>the use of strong liquors, which you know have been
                            so<br/>destructive to Indians as well as many white people. We<br/>hope
                            you will be strengthened by the Great Spirit to perse-<br/>vere in the
                            good resolution you have taken on this subject.</p>
<p>"Brothers, we desire the Good Spirit may be with you<br/>and influence
                            you and our friends in your councils, on the<br/>weighty subjects which
                            may come before you; that so<br/>everything may be settled and conducted
                            to mutual satis-<br/>faction and to the furtherance of our designs of
                            being last-<br/>ingly useful to you."</p>

<p>After the foregoing certificate was read and ex-<br/>plained to them, evident
                    marks of assent were dis-<br/>coverable, and we having concluded upon and
                    drawn<br/>up an address to them on the important contem-<br/>plated removal of
                    our young men, it was also read to<br/>them by paragraphs and interpreted as
                    follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1803-09-24"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p>To <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> and the other Chiefs of the<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca Nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> residing on the <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny River;</geogname><br/>Brothers:</p>
<p>You have heard the speech which our friends at<br/>home have sent to you
                            by us. We now wish you to<br/>speak your minds to us quite plain, and if
                            there is<br/>anything which does not feel easy to you, that you<br/>will
                            tell it to us.</p>
<p>Brothers, we have seen the speech made by you<br/>to our friends who live
                            among you, at one of your<br/>late councils, by which we understand you
                            leave<br/>them at full liberty to move up the river to settle
                            on<br/>land joining to yours.</p>
<p>Brothers, since we came here we have been<br/>viewing the land, and think
                            if the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/hollco">Holland Company<orgname key="hollco"></orgname></a><br/>will sell us
                            a piece on <geogname key="tunec">Tunesasah Creek</geogname> that it will
                            be<br/>a suitable place for our friends to settle upon; they<br/>will
                            then still be among your settlements.</p>
<p>Brothers, when our friends first came to settle<br/>among you, we told
                            you the tools they then brought<br/>should be for your use, to be lent
                            among such of you<br/><pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_26" n="578"></pb>as wanted to
                            use them. They have been so lent,<br/>and we have sent others for our
                            friends to use.<br/> When our friends remove, such of the first parcel
                            of<br/>tools as remain with them, will be left with your<br/>chiefs to
                            be lent out for the good of the nation.</p>
<p>Brothers, we have lent some blacksmith tools to<br/>the smith who resides
                            at the upper town; the others<br/>our friends take with them; but the
                            smith who lives<br/>here may have the use of them. The two smiths
                            we<br/>hope are now able to do nearly all the smith-work<br/>you will
                            want.</p>
<p>Brothers, if our friends get a house put up before<br/>winter suitable
                            for their accommmodation, they will<br/>remove from the one they now
                            live in. The barn<br/>and some of the land they may want another
                            sum-<br/>mer, as perhaps they cannot get land enough cleared<br/>to
                            raise grain and hay for their cattle. You will<br/>agree among
                            yourselves which of you shall live here<br/>when our friends remove.</p>
<p>Brothers, when our friends remove they will<br/>continue to give you
                            assistance and instruction when<br/>they can; if they think you stand in
                            need of it.<br/>Several of you have tools, and as there are some
                            of<br/>the first parcel which came up that are not worn out,<br/>they
                            will be left with the chiefs to be lent to such as<br/>want. Many of
                            these tools are already lent; we<br/>think it will be best for you to
                            appoint some person<br/>to have particular charge and care of them, as
                            lend-<br/>ing tools has been very troublesome.</p>
<p>Brothers, we understand by your speech to our<br/>friends that you want
                            them to bring on tools and<br/>cloth to sell. Brothers, we do not want
                            them to keep<br/>a store of goods among you; we think it will not
                            be<br/>best; but we intend to send on a few scythes,
                            sickles,<br/>augers, and some such tools for our friends to sell
                            to<br/>such of you as may want to buy; but if any of your<br/>people buy
                            from them and then sell to the white<br/>people, they are not to sell
                            any more to such as do so.</p>
<p>Brothers, we again repeat it, we wish you to<br/>speak your minds freely
                            to us, and if there is any-<br/>thing which you and we do not understand
                            alike,<br/>that you will tell us, as it is our wish to comply
                            with<br/>all our engagements. The iron which our friends<br/>have
                            promised you will be sent on as soon as the<br/>water will admit.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>After a little pause, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> replied:
                        <said who="cornp2">"If you<br/>will leave us a little while, we will counsel
                        among<br/>ourselves and return you an answer.</said></p>
<p>We then left them about an hour, when they sent<br/>us word they were ready. We
                    again seated ourselves<br/>as before, when Cornplanter addressed us in
                    sub-<br/>stance as follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1803-09-24"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p>We are all glad to see you that are now assem-<br/>bled in council, and
                            glad to hear what you say to us;<br/>and your speech is good, being the
                            same language<br/>you have always spoken to us. We know the time
                            is<br/>out that was first agreed upon for your young men to<br/>stay
                            with us, and that nothing had been said to us<br/>about their staying
                            longer, and perhaps that was the<br/>reason why they wanted to purchase
                            a piece of land<br/>from the <orgname>Holland Company</orgname> joining
                            to ours; but they<br/>were welcome to live where they now do as long
                            as<br/>they please; and if the <orgname>Holland Company</orgname> will
                            not<br/>sell you any land, we hope they will continue to live<br/>where
                            they now do. When your friends first came,<br/>and for a long time
                            after, many of the white people<br/>told us to 'watch the Quakers well,
                            for they are a<br/>cunning, designing people, [and] under pretense
                            of<br/>doing something for you intend to get some advan-<br/>tage of you
                            some way or other.' But of late, finding<br/>all was straight and no
                            advantage attempted to be<br/>taken, they have left off talking about
                            it. Your<br/>young men and we have now lived several years
                            as<br/>brothers. When they came here we were very ig-<br/>norant, but
                            are now just beginning to learn. Your<br/>young men do not talk much to
                            us, but when they<br/>do they speak good words and have been very
                            help-<br/>ful in keeping us from using whiskey. We had de-<br/>sired
                            them to agree among themselves who should<br/>live in this house, as
                            your young men expect to leave<br/>it before winter; but we do not think
                            it right to fix<br/>on any one yet, for if you cannot buy a piece of
                            land,<br/>they will need this place themselves; and if you do<br/>buy a
                            piece, they may not get a house fit to live in<br/>before winter, and
                            then they will want it themselves.<br/>You have said you will leave all
                            the buildings, fences,<br/>farm, etc., for us to have, except the barn
                            and some<br/>of the land next summer to raise some grain and<br/>hay for
                            yourselves and cattle until you can raise it<br/>on your new settlement;
                            but it is hard work to cut<br/>down so many big trees and clear the
                            land; perhaps<br/>they cannot get enough cleared next summer, and
                            if<br/>they do not, they are welcome to work this as long<br/>as they
                            need it. So it will be time enough to choose<br/>one of our people to
                            have this house and farm when<br/>your young men are well fixed on the
                            new place.<br/>We will appoint some of our chiefs to receive
                            the<br/>tools and collect such as are lent out; to have the<br/>charge
                            of lending them. In our speech to your young<br/>men we requested them
                            to bring cloth and tools to<br/>sell to us that we might not be cheated
                            by the white<br/>people. But you have come to a wise conclusion
                            in<br/>not keeping a general store amongst us, for perhaps<br/>some
                            uneasiness or dispute might arise if a store were<br/>kept. But we thank
                            you for your kind intention of<br/>bringing some scythes, sickles,
                            augers, etc., to sell to<br/>such of our people as may want them, and
                            are pleased<br/>that such who buy are restricted from selling to
                            white<br/>people; also for the iron which you propose to give<br/>to us,
                            we wish your young men may divide amongst<br/>our people, and then we
                            can get the smiths to make<br/>such things as we want.</p>
<p>Brothers, we are well pleased with your conduct<br/>toward us and having
                            always done what you prom-<br/>ised to do.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>An old chief called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mush1">Mush<persname key="mush1"></persname></a>said a few words as
                    a<br/>kind of acknowledgment for some little uneasiness<br/>he had occasioned
                    principally by his not heretofore<br/>understanding the nature of our intention
                    or prospect<br/>of settling our young men amongst them, but now<br/>appeared
                    perfectly satisfied. Then <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/conne1">Connewauteu<persname key="conne1"></persname></a><br/>said
                    that we promised to endeavor to send a smith<br/>among them; that after some
                    time we did send one,<br/>but he stayed a short time, <said who="conne1">and our
                        smiths were<br/>not fully perfect in the trade. Now you have sent
                        a<br/>smith, the best we ever saw; he can make every-<br/>thing we want, but
                        he has been here but a very little<br/>time and now says he is going away.
                        We wish he<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_27" n="579"></pb>would stay all winter, and then we
                        think our smiths<br/>by that time, with his instruction, will be able to
                        do<br/>our work; but now they cannot do all we want.</said></p>
<p>We replied that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpenn1">John Pennock,<persname key="jpenn1"></persname></a> (the good
                    smith<br/>he meant), had a wife and children at home who re-<br/>quired his
                    attention, and we could not urge him to<br/>stay from them longer than he was
                    willing; that he<br/>had been with them as long as we expected; but<br/>when we
                    got home we would mention their request<br/>to our friends for them to consider
                    whether they<br/>could help them or not.</p>
<p>And as I have heretofore and more stongly of<br/>late felt my mind impressed with
                    strong desires for<br/>the benefit and improvement of the poor natives
                    from<br/>whom our predecessors in the first settlement of<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> received so much kindness and
                    assist-<br/>ance, at times [I] felt a flow of good-will towards<br/>them, and
                    the rest of my brethren present having<br/>desired me to reply to them, I
                    addressed them in sub-<br/>stance, as follows:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1803-09-24"></date><placename key="cornp"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brethren and friends attend. It is now a great<br/>many years since our
                            forefathers, the Quakers, came<br/> over the great water and began to
                            settle in that part<br/>of this country called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania.<placename key="penns"></placename></a> At that time<br/>the Indians were very
                            numerous and we were but<br/>very few. The Indians were kind to our
                            forefathers,<br/>helped and assisted them in the wilderness.
                            Love<br/>and confidence were kept alive towards our fathers<br/>and the
                            Indians a great many years, and they were<br/>at peace with each other;
                            but after some years a great<br/>many other people came over the great
                            water and a<br/>great many were born here who were not so
                            peace-<br/>able and did not love the Indians so much as our<br/>fathers
                            did, who were the first settlers. And as these<br/>people became
                            numerous, for a good while [they] had<br/>a share in the great councils
                            in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania;<placename key="penns"></placename></a> and at<br/>length as
                            our fathers, the Quakers, were altogether<br/>for peace, and the others
                            became the more numerous,<br/>they took the great councils of the State
                            affairs in<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a> into
                            their hands; many of these were<br/>very desirous of having the Indians'
                            lands, and as<br/>fast as they could kept driving them back. Then
                            In-<br/>dians began to kill white men and white men to kill<br/>Indians.
                            All this time the Quakers loved the In-<br/>dians and did not kill any
                            of them, but were very<br/>sorry the Indians and white men did kill one
                            another,<br/>but could not help it; and [during] the long time
                            of<br/>Indians and white men being at war and killing one<br/>another,
                            treaties were often appointed, and although<br/>the Quakers had no power
                            over either the Indians or<br/>whites, yet some of them almost always
                            attended the<br/>treaties to try to keep the Indians from being
                            cheated<br/>out of their land or other things. The wars and<br/>troubles
                            continued at times between the Indians and<br/>whites, until about ten
                            years ago when there seemed<br/>to be a general peace agreed upon
                            between the In-<br/>dians and white people in this country. Soon
                            after<br/>that, at one of our great councils in Philadelphia,<br/>where
                            there were a great many hundred Quakers<br/>present, we remembered our
                            Indian brothers, whose<br/>fathers were so kind to our fathers, and on
                            whose<br/>fathers' lands, (which once belonged to them), we<br/>now live
                            so comfortably; and our Indian brothers<br/>being driven back, we
                            counciled amongst ourselves<br/>to know what way we could do them the
                            most good.<br/>We then thought if we would raise a great deal
                            of<br/>money--and give it to them, they would soon waste<br/>it and
                            spend it for whiskey and in other ways which<br/>would do them no good
                            at last. Then we concluded<br/>to ask leave of the President of the
                            United States to<br/>try to help our Indian brothers. The President
                            ap-<br/>peared to love the Indians and gave us leave; and as<br/>we knew
                            that by clearing and cultivating our land we<br/>had got to live
                            comfortably, we thought it would be<br/>best to get some of our sober,
                            industrious young men<br/>to come out and live amongst them and endeavor
                            to<br/>teach them to clear and farm their land so that they<br/>might
                            live comfortably as we do on ours. It is now<br/>several years since
                            some of our young men have been<br/>living amongst you.</p>
<p>Now, brothers, it rejoices our hearts to find that<br/>the Good Spirit
                            has preserved our young men<br/>amongst you and that we see signs of
                            industry taking<br/>place; many of you are beginning to build
                            better<br/>houses and clear out your land, raise more corn, as<br/>well
                            as cattle and wheat, particularly up the river.<br/>Brothers, you may be
                            assured that we do not want<br/>anything from you for all that we do for
                            you, neither<br/>your skins, your furs, your land, nor anything
                            else<br/>that you have; only that you should attend to the<br/>counsel
                            and instruction of our young men who live<br/>among you. Brothers, it
                            made our hearts glad when<br/>we heard from our young men that the
                                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/>of Indians, more
                            especially on the <geogname key="alleg">Alleghany
                            River</geogname>,<br/>had taken up the resolution to banish whiskey
                            and<br/>other strong liquor from amongst you; we wish you<br/>to be
                            strong in your resolution and join together as<br/>one man against this
                            mighty evil; and when any of<br/>your young men are out hunting or
                            otherwise met<br/>with white people that offer it to them, be sure to
                            re-<br/>fuse, for when a man drinks some he mostly wants<br/>more and
                            more until he gets drunk; and when that<br/>is the case either with
                            white people or Indians, they<br/>mostly neglect their business; their
                            wives and chil-<br/>dren often suffer for want of necessary
                            things.<br/>Brothers, there are other things that do a great
                            many<br/>white men much harm, which are gaming, playing<br/>cards and
                            laying wagers; whereby many of them<br/>not only spend their time
                            unprofitably, but often lose<br/>almost all that their wives, children,
                            and themselves<br/>should have to live upon. We wish you not to
                            fall<br/>into any of these practices, but to live sober,
                            indus-<br/>trious lives; and then the Good Spirit will love
                            and<br/>preserve you. But if you will get drunk and be<br/>wicked, you
                            will feel sorrow and trouble in your own<br/>hearts for it.</p>

<p>After which a letter from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jparr1">John Parrish<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Corn-planter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> was read, which
                    mentioned this desire,--that<br/>they might follow the counsel we gave them;
                    that<br/>they would have the ox instead of the buffalo, the<br/>hog instead of
                    the bear, and the sheep instead of the<br/>deer.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> then replied it was very true if
                    we<br/>had given them a large sum of money it would all<br/>have been gone
                    before now and they would have<br/>been none the better; and he appeared quite
                    elevated<br/>with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jparr1">John Parrish's<persname key="jparr1"></persname></a> prospect of
                    their having domestic<br/>animals instead of the wild, and said very
                        pleasantly<br/><pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_28" n="580"></pb>that he should soon be
                    an old man leaning on his<br/>staff and could no more go out to hunt, and if
                    they<br/>followed our advice he would then never want fresh<br/>meat--he could
                    have it at the door and not have to<br/>go to the woods for it. Then the chiefs
                    and divers of<br/>the young men took us by the hand and with great<br/>marks of
                    affection concluded the council.</p>

<p>On meditat-<br/>ing on the occurrences of the day and what we have<br/>seen and
                    heard and felt since we came amongst them,<br/>I felt a secret satisfaction to
                    spring in my heart, ac-<br/>companied with a belief that the Everlasting
                    Father<br/>and Care-taker of men owns the concern for the im-<br/>proving of
                    these inhabitants of the wilderness, and<br/>that their understandings were more
                    clearly opened<br/>to see into the nature, utility, and disinterestedness<br/>of
                    our labor, expense, and concern for their improve-<br/>ment. Last evening our
                    horses came, we having sent<br/>three Indians for them last Fourth-day to
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/fking1">FrancisKing's,<persname key="fking1"></persname></a> near sixty miles from
                    hence, where we left<br/>them. We were glad to see them, though they
                    ap-<br/>pear to be more worsted than if we had been riding<br/>them every
                    day.</p>

<p>A rainy morning; we threshed and winnowed<br/>six bushels of oats for [the use
                    of] our horses<br/>[going] through the wilderness to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta1">Cattaraugus<placename key="catta1"></placename></a>.</p>

                    a<br/>great mountain and encamped, having a fine day to<br/>ride, and at night
                    to lodge under our tent, it being<br/>the same place where I lodged four years
                    ago,--a most<br/> tremendous night with rain and wind. Here we met<br/>with

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta2">Cattaraugus,<placename key="catta2"></placename></a> passed through the village of
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/delaware">DelawareIndians,<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> and propose to lodge
                    with the chief warrior<br/> of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Cattaraugus<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas.<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> I described the land and<br/>timber of
                    this day's ride, heretofore, which upon a<br/>second view I think was not
                    exaggerated. Arrived<br/>here about three o'clock. Although some of
                    our<br/>company, for a considerable time in the forepart of<br/>our journey,
                    appeared somewhat delicate as to food<br/>and lodging, I find almost any person
                    of common un-<br/>derstanding by constant practice in any kind of busi-<br/>ness
                    becomes in good measure perfect; so we all ap-<br/>pear to be approaching
                    towards a reconciliation with<br/>our present allotment. The chiefs of this
                    settlement,<br/>being scattered so that we could not get them to-<br/>gether
                    this evening, we concluded to have them col-<br/>lected to-morrow.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock, forenoon, seven or eight<br/>chiefs, with perhaps ten or
                    twelve young men, or<br/>what they call "warriors," collected in the chief

<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1803-09-29"></date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers, we believe it was consistent with the<br/>mind of the Great
                            Spirit, that we should meet here<br/>to-day. We thank the Great Spirit
                            for preserving<br/>you in your long journey to see us; and it is
                            quite<br/>plain to us that he intends to do us good, because he<br/>has
                            put it into the hearts of the Quakers to come and<br/>see us, and to
                            instruct us; and now you are come,<br/>have found us, (and we have met
                            you), all in good<br/>health, our hearts are so filled with thanks to
                            the<br/>Great Spirit above, and to you, that we can not ex-<br/>press
                            it.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tecon1">Teconondee<persname key="tecon1"></persname></a>, or Flying Arrow, the

<p>Brothers, we are thankful to the Great Spirit for<br/>opening the way for
                            us to meet here to-day. Our<br/>hearts are made glad when we remember
                            the Great<br/>Spirit has put it into the hearts of our brothers
                            to<br/>take notice of us; for we are a poor, destitute people,<br/>our
                            lands being almost all gone, and we hope you will<br/>excuse, or not
                            think hard of us, when we open our<br/> helpless situation to you. We
                            have sent for <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">JacobTaylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> to give
                            us some advice about our saw-mill, it<br/>being out of order. Now we are
                            convinced the Good<br/>Spirit approves of our request, and has a mind to
                            do<br/>us good, because he has so ordered it that our<br/>brothers, some
                            of the Quaker chiefs, have come along<br/>with him.</p>
<p>Brothers, we have been made glad when we<br/>heard from our brothers, the
                            Quakers, that they were<br/> willing to take three or four of our boys
                            and instruct<br/>them in farming and other useful training and
                            occu-<br/>pations. Brothers, we are very thankful to you for<br/>your
                            kind offer, and we have been counselling among<br/>ourselves and trying
                            to get some boys about the age<br/>of fifteen, that will be of good
                            dispositions and in-<br/>genious in learning; for we think if we could
                            get<br/>some of them instructed as you are, they might be<br/>very
                            useful to our nation, not only in teaching others,<br/>but in keeping
                            our accounts, so that we may not be<br/>cheated. Brothers, we find this
                            is a very hard thing<br/> to come at. We have a good many boys that
                            would<br/>do, but their relations think so much of them they<br/> cannot
                            bear to part with them; but here is one, a<br/>nephew of mine, fifteen
                            years old, who is willing to<br/> go, and is a fine boy. His father and
                            mother are<br/>also willing; but his grandfather and his uncle
                            refuse<br/> to let him go, and say they cannot part with him, so<br/>we
                            must give him out for the present, for it is of the<br/> utmost
                            importance to us to maintain harmony in our<br/>nation. There is one
                            about nine years old that I<br/> would be glad you would take; he is a
                            fine boy.</p>

<p>Then the chief warrior, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta<persname key="wauun1"></persname></a>,ad-<br/>dressed us; although they were not in a
                    very florid<br/>style, yet his remarks appeared, and we fully believed<br/>them,
                    to be the product of an honest and sincere<br/>heart; to this effect:</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1803-09-29"></date><placename key="checkPlace"></placename></dateline>
<p>Brothers, I hope you will not think hard of us<br/>when we open our
                            hearts to you, for we are a poor,<br/> destitute people, and our land is
                            now so nearly all<br/>sold that we have but a little left for every
                            family;<br/> and the deer is become very scarce, so that we
                            often<br/>may hunt all day and have nothing at night. Broth-<br/> ers,
                            our hearts rejoiced when we heard the Quakers<br/>were taking pity on
                            us, although we could scarcely<br/> think there was any people who would
                            do so much<br/>as you are doing for us, without being paid. But<br/> now
                            we are convinced that the Quakers have the<br/>good of our nation at
                            heart, for we see you have sent<br/> some of your young men to the
                                <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny River</geogname> to<br/>teach the
                            Indians to farm, without asking any pay<br/>for it; and we see that many
                            of our people are<br/>learning. They live much better than formerly,
                            and<br/>we have seen so much of the conduct of your young<br/>men that
                            we can rely upon them; and we have found<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> to be a true man. Brothers, we are<br/>
                            ashamed to ask what we are now going to ask of you,<br/> but our
                            necessity makes us willing. We cannot ex-<br/> pect you to do so much as
                            to send any of your young<br/>men to live among us; but we think if you
                            would<br/> send us a set of smith's tools, we have a young man<br/>that
                            has learned at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta,<placename key="genes1"></placename></a> that
                            can do our<br/> smith work. Now we have to go above thirty miles<br/>to
                            get it done and often have to wait near a week be-<br/>fore we can get
                            it done. And we are determined to<br/>get to farming, working our land,
                            and to raising wheat<br/>to support our families. Brothers, you have
                            done a<br/> great deal for us in sending us saw-mill irons
                            which<br/>have been of great use to us; but our saw-mill is out<br/>of
                            order, and that is the reason we sent for <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> to show us how to mend it, as he is a
                            man we<br/>can confide in. But, brothers, do not think hard of<br/>us if
                            we should ask one thing more, for the Great<br/>Spirit has blessed you
                            with wise hearts and you are<br/>become rich; and that is we have but
                            one plow and<br/>many of us are desirous of becoming farmers and<br/>sow
                            wheat, but cannot get a plow. If you would send<br/>us another set of
                            plow-irons, we have two good yoke<br/>of oxen and a number of horses,
                            then we think we<br/> could do pretty well. </p>
<p>Brothers, we have heard your advice or counsel<br/>to us in time past to
                            refrain from drinking whiskey.<br/>We thank you for it, for we see if we
                            do not, we shall<br/> come to nothing; and, brothers, you sent us a
                            letter<br/>four years ago wherein you told us that if we did not
                            <br/>leave off drinking whiskey you would be discouraged<br/>from trying
                            to help us, but if we would leave off and<br/>become sober men, you
                            would be encouraged to as-<br/>sist us as you could. That letter we have
                            yet. [They<br/>then produced the letter to us and we found it
                            was<br/>written by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thos. Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>
                            and myself, and our<br/> names were signed to it]. Now, brothers, we
                            are<br/>often counselling together about it, and are determ-<br/>ined to
                            refrain from the use of it, and although some<br/>few of our young men
                            sometimes break over our res-<br/>olution, we think we are gaining
                            ground or strength<br/>in the good undertaking; and of all the chiefs
                            and<br/>warriors that are now present, we believe not one has<br/>been
                            drunk for more than two years past, and some<br/>for a longer time than
                            that, and divers of us have not<br/> drunk any; so we are encouraged to
                            be strong in full<br/>hope that we shall banish it altogether.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>In the evening the chief warrior's daughter, who<br/>is an amiable young woman,
                    came home from a visit<br/> at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">Buffalo,<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>
                    accompanied by a young man her rela-<br/>tion. On their way they discovered a
                    young deer<br/>about half-grown, in the edge of <geogname key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie,</geogname> which<br/>they chased with their canoe and killed with
                    their<br/>setting poles and brought it home. Some of the<br/> meat added to the
                    satisfaction of our supper. After<br/>their arrival, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta<persname key="wauun1"></persname></a> introduced his daugh-<br/>ter to us all, one by
                    one, holding her by the hand;<br/>and she without any appearance of unbecoming
                    shy-<br/>ness shook hands with us all, in a modest manner,<br/>which altogether
                    appeared so becomingly polite that<br/>we could not help noticing it with
                    peculiar pleasure.<br/>On taking leave of him in the morning, he in
                    a<br/>weighty and feeling manner expressed: "We are<br/>glad you have stayed two
                    nights with us, and I hope<br/>the Great Spirit will look down upon you and
                    pre-<br/>serve you in your long journey, and favor you with a<br/>clear sky, so
                    that you may get home in good health<br/> and find your wives and children
                    so."</p>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_31" n="595"></pb>
<p>We then withdrew a few minutes to confer upon<br/>their proposals and requests,
                    and soon returned to in-<br/> form them what we agreed upon. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoemaker<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a><br/>rose and informed them<br/> that
                    we believed it would not<br/>be best to send one boy only, because he would be
                    likely<br/>to feel himself lonesome and so become uneasy;<br/>neither did we
                    think it would be best to send one<br/>younger than 13 years, lest when the
                    older one had<br/>served out his time and had gone home, the younger<br/>one
                    would be uneasy. But if they could get two or<br/>three boys of good disposition
                    and near of an age who<br/> would be willing to come and work as some of
                    our<br/>children do, we should be willing to accept of them<br/> and use our
                    endeavours to instruct them.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>informed them
                    that<br/>although we had not proposed to do any great matters<br/>for them, yet
                    as they appeared desirous of improv-<br/>ing, we were willing to assist them a
                    little, and would<br/>send them a pair of bellows, an anvil, vise, and
                    some<br/>other tools to begin with, if they thought <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/sjemi1">Sam
                        Jemi-son,<persname key="sjemi1"></persname></a> (who has been instructed in the business
                        at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta<placename key="genes1"></placename></a>), would come and do
                    their work; also<br/>we would furnish them with one hundred lbs. of iron,<br/>a
                    set of plow-irons, and some steel to begin with.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta<persname key="wauun1"></persname></a> then replied: <said who="wauun1">"You are wiser<br/>than we, and we believe have come to a good
                        conclu-<br/>sion about the boys, and we think we shall be likely<br/>to get
                        two pretty near of an age in a few weeks, who<br/>will be willing to go, and
                        whose parents and rela-<br/>tions will consent to their going. And if any of
                        our<br/>boys are sent, we want them taught to work as your<br/>children are;
                        for it will be of very little use for them<br/>just to learn to read and
                        write if they do not know<br/>how to work.</said></p>
<p>During almost all the time of the council, I think<br/>that notwithstanding they
                    are a very dirty, mean<br/>people in and about their houses, cookery, etc.,
                    I<br/>never felt a greater flow of near affection to any<br/>people, accompanied
                    with what I took to be an as-<br/> surance that their souls are as precious in
                    the eyes of<br/>Him who is impartial in judging of the inmost re-<br/>cesses of
                    the heart, as ours are who have been blessed<br/>with so many inexpressible
                    favours; (I fear too often<br/>with but little sense of gratitude; to the
                    Great<br/> Spirit for influencing our hearts to take pity on them,<br/>and to us
                    in manifesting our kindness, insomuch that<br/>I could not suppress a flow of
                    tears; and although a<br/>good deal had been said on both sides, it being
                    likely<br/>I should never have the same or a like opportunity,<br/>I thought I
                    could not leave them easy without en-<br/>deavoring to open to them the real
                    cause of our com-<br/> ing; the origin of the concern which the Society
                    is<br/>engaged in for their good; that the good men in our<br/>Society always
                    loved our Indian brothers, and during<br/>the whole time the white people and
                    Indians were at<br/>war and killing one another, we had no hand in it
                    nor<br/>could not be at war with anybody, but were sorry for<br/>it. And
                    although we had no outward power in our<br/>hands, generally when treaties were
                    appointed be-<br/>tween the white people and themselves, some of us<br/>attended
                    to try to keep them from being cheated.</p>
<p>And when the war was over we were willing to try<br/>to help and instruct them.
                    With much more similar<br/>to what I expressed in the council at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genes1">Genesinguhta,<placename key="genes1"></placename></a><br/> relative to the bad effects
                    attendant upon the use of<br/>ardent spirits both upon white men and
                    Indians,<br/> with a strong recommendation to them to endeavour<br/>to avail
                    themselves in every respect of the opportu-<br/> nity put into their power of
                    improving the little good<br/>land they have left, and following the advice and
                    ex-<br/> ample set and given them by our young men who re-<br/>side with their
                    brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Senecas<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a> on the <geogname key="alleg">Allegheny<br/>River.</geogname> Also I informed them that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> in-<br/>tended to stop on his return
                    from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">Buffalo<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> and view<br/>their saw-mill. And
                    although we were desirous of<br/>getting forward this afternoon, on our way to
                        <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo<br/>Creek,</geogname> and made attempts to
                    conclude the council,<br/>they were so pleased with our company that
                    it<br/>seemed too hard for them to part with us; and the<br/>chief warrior said
                    he was sorry and ashamed they<br/> were not in a capacity to entertain us
                    better, but if<br/>we would be so kind as to stay another night with<br/>them
                    they would do the best they could, and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tecon1">Flying
                        Arrow<persname key="tecon1"></persname></a> said he would bring as much corn as our<br/>horses could
                    eat. For my part, I was not in a ca-<br/>pacity to refuse their request and told
                    my companions<br/>I would rather stay with them until the next morn-<br/>ing. To
                    this they all consented and we informed<br/>them so. They seemed much rejoiced;
                    the chief<br/>warrior saying we had made the hearts of their<br/>women and
                    children glad, and some more of them<br/>would be glad to take us by the band.
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tecon1">Flying Arrow<persname key="tecon1"></persname></a><br/>soon sent us plenty of
                    corn, and his father cut corn<br/>tops enough and brought to our horses. The
                    chief<br/>warrior's wife exerted herself in doing all she could<br/>for us.
                    After the council was concluded and the most of<br/>the Indians gone, also
                    Harry, who was our interpreter,<br/>I had a good deal of very friendly
                    conversation with<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta<persname key="wauun1"></persname></a>, (our
                    landlord), <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> in-<br/>terpreting. I
                    soon found there were such impres-<br/>sions made upon his mind that it has
                    opened a door<br/>to a large scope of inquiry; and I believe many<br/>things
                    appeared in a fresh or new light to him. I<br/>discovered him for some time to
                    be in a deep study;<br/>at last he said there was one thing he wanted to
                    ask<br/>but was afraid the question would not please us. We<br/> told him he
                    might ask anything. He then said,<br/>some time ago when he was at the
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/feder">Federal City,<placename key="feder"></placename></a> on<br/>his way there he saw
                    a great many black men that<br/>were slaves to white men and looked miserable;
                    and<br/>he wanted to know whether the Quakers kept any of<br/>them. We told him
                    we did not, and did not think it<br/>right. He seemed very much pleased. Many
                    things<br/>more he asked; [so] that truly the undissembled ap-<br/>pearace and
                    conduct of this man and his wife made<br/>very pleasant impressions on all our
                    minds.</p>

<p>EARLY in the morning on the <date when="1803-09-30">30th [of 9th
                        month,<br/>1803]</date> we all set off and rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">New Amsterdam,<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> at the<br/> mouth of <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek,</geogname>which is about thirty-three<br/> miles, eight of
                    which is mostly bad road or path<br/>through the woods to <geogname key="lakee">Lake Erie;</geogname> the other part of<br/>the way is down the lake on the
                    margin. A very<br/>pleasant ride, although each time I have ridden it I<br/>have
                    been affected with the headache. A material<br/>change appears to me to have
                    taken place on the<br/>margin since I was along it four years ago.
                    The<br/>beautiful beds of lime-stone are generally covered<br/>with sand, and
                    much of the best kind of slate very<br/>much gone. When we arrived at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">Amsterdam,<placename key="buffa"></placename></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/redja1">RedJacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>and several other Indian chiefs
                    were there<br/>along with the mill-wrights who say they have com-<br/>pleted the
                    saw-mill for the Indians and want their<br/> pay. We sent for some of them and
                    desired to know<br/>whether we could have them personally in council<br/>
                    to-morrow at their village. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>
                    informed us<br/>they would be glad if they could comply with our<br/>desire, but
                    hoped we would have patience, for they<br/>could not well meet us to-morrow, but
                    would meet<br/>early the next day. We then conferred together and<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">Isaac Bonsal<persname key="ibons1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">George
                        Vaux<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> were most easy to go<br/>over the <geogname key="niaga">Niagara river</geogname> to-morrow in order to be at<br/> the meeting at
                        <geogname key="blacc">Black Creek</geogname> the next day, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">ThomasStewardson,<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoemaker,<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a> and myself were most<br/>easy
                    to stay in order to attend the proposed council<br/>on First-day morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">JacobTaylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> and myself went twelve miles
                    up the <geogname key="buffc1">Buffalo<br/>Creek</geogname> to see the new
                    saw-mill that is built for the<br/>Indians, (we some time past having made them
                    a<br/>present of all the iron), divers of the chiefs and one<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_33" n="611"></pb> of the undertakers attending. I
                    discovered it to be<br/>an excellent seat, and it appeared to be a strong
                    mill;<br/> but upon trial in our presence it was far from answer-<br/>ing our
                    expectations according to the contract, by<br/> not sawing half as fast as we
                    believed such a stream-<br/>head and fall would do if the workmanship had
                    been<br/>effectually executed. The chiefs said they were<br/>ready to pay off
                    the contract if we would say it was<br/>well done, according to contract; and on
                    our confer-<br/>ring with the rest of our company the next day, we<br/> advised
                    them not to pay off the contract until it was<br/>completed. As I rode this
                    twelve miles up the creek<br/> and back again through the Indian reserve I think
                    a<br/>great part of it is equal if not superior to any piece<br/> of land of
                    equal quantity I ever saw. I believe there<br/>are more than a thousand acres
                    upon which there<br/>might have been more than two tons of hay to the<br/>acre
                    mowed and made the present year. </p>

<p>In the morning we set<br/>off and arrived at the Indian village, in their
                    council<br/>house, about eleven o'clock; but we had to wait until<br/>near four
                    in the afternoon before what we thought a<br/>competent number collected. They
                    generally appear<br/>to be a more indolent, careless, and some of
                    them<br/>intemperate people than those at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/alleg1">Allegheny<placename key="alleg1"></placename></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta1">Cat-taraugus,<placename key="catta1"></placename></a> a few instances excepted, particularly
                    one<br/>called the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/young1">Young King<persname key="young1"></persname></a> and another
                    called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/polla1">Pol-lard,<persname key="polla1"></persname></a> who are sober, temperate
                    men, and as intent<br/> upon being farmers as any we have seen. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/young1">The YoungKing<persname key="young1"></persname></a> having cleared and plowed a good
                    deal of land,<br/>has several horses, a very good yoke of oxen, and<br/>seven
                    milch cows; and it is said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/polla1">Pollard<persname key="polla1"></persname></a>rather
                    ex-<br/>ceeds him. I hope their example may induce many<br/>more to follow them,
                    there being the greatest num-<br/>ber on this reserve of any in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/seneca">Seneca nation.<orgname key="seneca"></orgname></a><br/>When the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/young1">Young King,<persname key="young1"></persname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/redja1">Red Jacket,<persname key="redja1"></persname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/farme1">Farmer's Brother,<persname key="farme1"></persname></a><br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/polla1">Pollard,<persname key="polla1"></persname></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jberr1">Jack Berry,<persname key="jberr1"></persname></a> and five or six other chiefs
                    were<br/> collected with some young men and women, we pro-<br/>posed either
                    going back or opening the council. They<br/>then went in the council house and
                    after sitting a<br/>short space, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas
                        Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a> in a brief manner<br/>informed them the reason of our
                    coming into their<br/>settlement; and although there did not appear to be<br/>
                    the same desire of improvement in many of the In-<br/>dians in this settlement
                    as those we have been at be-<br/>fore, which I believe is much owing to the
                    opportu-<br/>nity they have of being corrupted by the example of<br/>white
                    people at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">New Amsterdam,<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> which is a very
                    dis-<br/>sipated place, yet he felt encouraged to endeavor to<br/>stimulate them
                    to industry and to refrain from spirit-<br/>uous liquors. It was not a very
                    comfortable, animat-<br/>ing time as yet with them, yet I was not easy to
                    omit<br/>opening divers matters to their consideration in a<br/>summary way,
                    which contained a good deal of the<br/>heads of what I mentioned at the other
                    places; which<br/>seemed to attract their attention. I also informed<br/>them I
                    had seen a good deal of the land contained<br/> in their reserve that is
                    excellent; and if they would<br/>be industrious they might live well; but if
                    they would<br/>not, but followed the practice of drinking, they would<br/>lose
                    the little good land they now have, their wives<br/>and children would have to
                    lie down under the snow<br/>and go to sleep without anything to eat or to
                    keep<br/>them warm. </p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoemaker<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a> advised them to settle
                    farther<br/> up the creek, where the land is so very good, and not<br/>strive to
                    huddle together so close; which advice<br/>seemed to please them very well.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/redja1">Red Jacket<persname key="redja1"></persname></a> then addressed us in a polite and
                    mas-<br/> terly manner in which he displayed his talents as an<br/>orator in a
                    methodical and flowery style near half an<br/>hour. He took in every part of the
                    advice commu-<br/>nicated to them by us, in regular order, and para-<br/>phrased
                    upon it, with the frequent expression of<br/>thanks to the Quakers, recounting
                    their kindness to<br/>the Indian from the first settlement of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/penns">Pennsylvania;<placename key="penns"></placename></a><br/>and concluded with endeavoring to
                    assure us if we<br/>would come and see them two years hence, we should<br/>find
                    them much improved in farming, and also in<br/>the disuse of whiskey. And
                    notwithstanding I be-<br/>lieved his speech was calculated to endeavor to
                    please<br/>us, and that there was much less sincerity or reality<br/>in his
                    intentions than in those of whom we have<br/>conferred with before, yet I could
                    have sat, I think,<br/>patiently two or three hours to hear him exert
                    his<br/>smooth, oily, oratorical abilities.</p>
<p>We then left them. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/young1">Young King<persname key="young1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/polla1">Pollard<persname key="polla1"></persname></a> in<br/>a particular manner parted with us
                    very affectionate-<br/>ly. Returned to our lodging at a tavern in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/buffa">New Am-sterdam,<placename key="buffa"></placename></a> this being the third night.</p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tstew1">Thomas Stewardson<persname key="tstew1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a> set off<br/>for <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a> in order to see <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">J.
                        Ellicot,<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a> in order to agree<br/>upon <geogname key="tunec">Tunesasa Creek,</geogname> and also to pay a visit to the<br/>Indians at
                    the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tonne">Tonnewanto.<placename key="tonne"></placename></a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoemaker<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a> and<br/>myself rode down to the
                    ferry on the great river <geogname key="niaga">Ni-<br/>agara,</geogname> and
                    crossed in six minutes. There I saw three<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/mohawk">Mohawk Indians<orgname key="mohawk"></orgname></a> carry a bark canoe a
                    considerable<br/>distance and put it in the river, then five of them<br/>got in
                    it and rowed across<br/> in five minutes; said river<br/>is said to be above a
                    mile wide. We then rode to the<br/>mouth of [the] <geogname key="chipp">Chippewa,</geogname> fed our horses and took a<br/>snack, at which place
                    there was a British officer who<br/>was formerly stationed in the neighborhood
                    of the<br/>great Falls, but is now fixed at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/york">York,<placename key="york"></placename></a> over <geogname key="lakeo">Lake On-<br/>tario.</geogname>
                    He being on his way up to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/longp">Long Point<placename key="longp"></placename></a> on
                        the<br/><geogname key="niaga">Grand River,</geogname> he was so much pleased
                    to be in com-<br/>pany with a couple of Quakers that he politely offered<br/>to
                    accompany us to the Falls and show us the way<br/>down. As we rode down the
                    river in view of the<br/> rapids we met <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ibons1">I.
                        Bonsal<persname key="ibons1"></persname></a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">G. Vaux<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> who had
                    been<br/>taking an upper view. They turned back with us<br/>and we all went to
                    the ladder where the curious are<br/>accustomed to go down, the officer leading
                    the way;<br/> but the tremendous appearance of the way down<br/>discouraged
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshoe1">John Shoemaker<persname key="jshoe1"></persname></a> from attempting it.<br/>The
                    rest of us followed the officer down and then up<br/>the craggy, slippery way to
                    the edge of the great<br/>shoot of water; which together with returning is
                    a<br/>laborious task, for a believe there were but very few<br/> dry threads,
                    either linen or woollen, upon any of us<br/>when we returned. I having four
                    years ago had a<br/>view and given some description of this amazing
                    cat-<br/>aract, need not write much now. While I was view-<br/>ing this
                    superlatively grand and most astonishing<br/>natural curiosity of the kind in
                    the known world, my<br/> curiosity would have been fully satisfied had it
                    not<br/>been for one reflection or consideration, which was<br/>that I knew my
                    wife had a great desire to enjoy the<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_34" n="612"></pb> view I was then favored with, which made
                    me feel as<br/>though I was only half satisfied. We returned to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/chipp1">Chippewa<placename key="chipp1"></placename></a> and lodged, having ridden
                    twenty-four<br/>miles this day.</p>

<p>We set off and rode down the river by the side<br/>of the rapids above the Falls
                    for a little more than a<br/>mile and then took another view of the great
                    phenom-<br/>enon; and I think this morning, the whole of the<br/>prospect
                    appeared more astonishingly great and beau-<br/>tiful than I had ever seen it
                    before, it being a clear<br/>morning, and viewing the great fall and the
                    dash-<br/>ing of the huge and confused rolls of water over the<br/>rocks in the
                    rapids between us and the sun, to be<br/>sure appeared amazingly grand and
                    gratifying. We<br/>then rode four or five miles to view the whirlpool,<br/>which
                    four years ago I thought as great a curiosity as<br/>the other; yet I was
                    disappointed now, though it ap-<br/>peared a wonderful place, but very far
                    inferior to<br/>what it did then; there being but few logs in it,
                    and<br/>whether it was owing to the stillness of the day or<br/>from some other
                    cause, I know not, there did not<br/>appear the sucks formed taking down the
                    logs, nor the<br/>very great agitation there was then. We then rode
                        to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wlund1">Wm. Lunday's<persname key="wlund1"></persname></a>; dined; and thence to

<p>Attended the monthly meeting of Friends at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/meetpelh">Pelham<orgname key="meetpelh"></orgname></a>, which myself and others had established in<br/>the year
                        <date when="1799">1799</date>. I remember it was a subject of
                    great<br/>weight with me at that time, being impressed with<br/>some serious
                    doubts that the members which were<br/> to compose said monthly meeting were
                    furnished<br/>with religious experience or skill enough<br/> to be

                    into membership, or to deny from the<br/>privileges of the Society. And although
                    there now<br/> appear to be more in number than there were at<br/>first opening,
                    and some rather more experienced, yet<br/>I apprehend they still remain in a

                    a<br/>careless situation respecting the foul channel in which<br/>they receive
                    or obtain the titles for their lands, or<br/>whether it would not be better to
                    apply for redress.<br/>Some of them at first expressed they thought it was<br/>a
                    matter of no consequence, but others expressed<br/>their dissatisfaction. At
                    length they united in desir-<br/>ing that the Yearly Meeting, or Meeting for
                    Suffer-<br/>ings, might take the matter upon their behalf.<br/>Lodged at

                    myself rode to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/queen">Queenstown<placename key="queen"></placename></a> and dined;
                    then<br/> crossed the great river <geogname key="niagr">Niagara</geogname> where
                    it is not half a<br/>mile wide, but we were told the depth hath
                    hitherto<br/>been unfathomable. It looks a terrifying place to<br/>cross; the
                    water appears nearly as green as grass and<br/>whirling round, I suppose
                    occasioned by the great<br/>rocks in the bottom; this being the place where

                    exhibited the<br/>grand appearance they now do up the river miles away.<br/>We
                    got over safely and in about five miles came to the<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tusca1">Tuscarora<placename key="tusca1"></placename></a> village of Indians, where I met with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jacob1">Jacob,<persname key="jacob1"></persname></a><br/>the Indian, who learned the smith trade
                    with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jpenn1">JohnPennock<persname key="jpenn1"></persname></a>. He appeared much
                    pleased with seeing us. A<br/>number of other Indians were helping him to put
                    up<br/>a coal pit. He told us his cousin learned first, and a<br/>great many of
                    the white people from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/queen">Queenstown<placename key="queen"></placename></a><br/> and

                    From<br/>his appearance and disposition of industry, I thought<br/>our expense
                    and trouble in educating him were well<br/>spent. Then rode to one Beech's in the wilderness,<br/> where we met with
                    two families from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/catta">Cattawissa<placename key="catta"></placename></a>, one<br/>of
                    which was <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ejame1">Ezekiel James's<persname key="ejame1"></persname></a>, who were moving
                    to<br/>Yonge street in <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/canad">Upper Canada<persname key="canad"></persname></a>. We all
                    lodged in this<br/>cabin, being twenty-three of us besides the

<p>Rode forty miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a>. All the
                    way<br/>except one or two cabins and a few settlements a lit-<br/>tle before we
                    came to the town, this day's ride was<br/>all through the Holland Purchase, and
                    a good deal of<br/>it very good land, especially near <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/batav">Batavia<placename key="batav"></placename></a> which is<br/>the county town of a new county called
                        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/genec">Genesee<placename key="genec"></placename></a>,<br/>containing about twenty-five
                    houses, a large court-<br/>house and jail. When I was through this
                    country<br/>four years ago, there was no settlement or improve-<br/>ment from
                    Buffalo to the eastern transit line of<br/>the Holland land--which is above
                    fifty miles. It is<br/>surprising how the Eastern or New England men<br/>open
                    the woods and settle, it being chiefly men from<br/>those states who emigrate
                    into this new country; and<br/>although I think the land in general is equal to
                    what<br/>I conceived it to be when here before, there is one<br/>very
                    discouraging consideration which is the great<br/>scarcity of water, we having
                    ridden in one place to-<br/>day twenty-five miles without finding any for
                    our-<br/>selves or horses, and in general very scarce. But it<br/> hath been an
                    uncommon drought at this place. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">JosephEllicot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a> lives here.

                    informed<br/>us they had agreed with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jelic1">Ellicot<persname key="jelic1"></persname></a>
                    for the land on <geogname key="tunec">Tune-<br/>sasa Creek</geogname>, which we

<p>This morning <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">GeorgeVaux's<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> horse appeared
                    to be very much amiss, but we<br/>all set off early and rode six miles to a good

                    horses; but when we set off it was thought<br/>by us all [that] <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gvaux1">George Vaux's<persname key="gvaux1"></persname></a> horse would not be able<br/>to travel

                    township. And they have now<br/>a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/meetfarmi">monthly
                        meeting<orgname key="meetfarmi"></orgname></a>, which is held the fifth day of the<br/>week before the
                    last First-day in every month. I<br/>was glad to meet with divers Friends with
                    whom I<br/>had formerly spent some time very agreeably. The<br/>meeting appears
                    to be very much increased since I<br/>was here before. It was silent to-day. We
                    dined at<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ncoms1">Nathan Comstock's<persname key="ncoms1"></persname></a> and then rode

                    considerable number of the Friends<br/>of the neighborhood came and spent the

                    here. Upon<br/>the whole it was a very agreeable and satisfactory<br/>evening.
                    Many subjects of a religious nature were<br/>conversed upon which I believe
                    ended to mutual sat-<br/>isfaction; and I think I was not mistaken when
                    here<br/>before, when I believed if they improved in a religious<br/>sense
                    according to their activity and talents, they<br/> might be a shining light in
                    this fast settling northern<br/>county of good land. This day, twenty miles.

<p>Spent this [day] in order to let our horses<br/>rest and get some of our linen
                    washed. We took the<br/> opportunity of walking to see some friends and
                    view<br/>the improvements made by these Eastern people,<br/>which exceed what
                    can be conceived in the idea of a<br/> Pennsylvanian or more southern man, for
                    the time.<br/>They seem as if there were scarcely anything too hard<br/>or too
                    heavy for them to undertake and go through<br/>with, especially in opening a new
                    country heavily<br/>timbered. Said <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/alaph1">Lapham<persname key="alaph1"></persname></a>,
                    though he does not appear<br/>a robust man, has made a surprising
                    improvement<br/>for the fime he has been settled here which is about<br/>eight
                    years; and although there has been an uncom-<br/>mon drought in this country
                    this year, they have made<br/>250 cheeses this summer, many of which will
                    weigh<br/>fifty pounds, and but very few less than thirty pounds,<br/> which, to
                    be sure, in their cheese-house has a beauti-<br/>ful appearance. Although I have
                    such an opinion of<br/>the Eastern men in opening the wilderness, I
                    think<br/>they are far short of a good Pennsylvania farmer in<br/>keeping their
                    farms in good order after they have them<br/>cleared. We propose to lodge
                    another night with these<br/>our kind friends, <persname rend="alaph1">Abraham</persname> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/elaph1">Esther Lapham,<persname key="elaph1"></persname></a>
                    who<br/>seem disposed to do everything they can to accommo-<br/>date us. The
                    neighbors hereabouts have been two<br/>nights and one day collecting and
                    bringing their hogs<br/>to Lapham's, and to-morrow morning they propose
                    to<br/>set off with 250 of them about seven or eight miles into<br/>the woods to
                    feed upon the acorns and beech nuts<br/> which are very plenty, and have agreed
                    with four per-<br/>sons to stay in the woods with them, night and day,<br/>for
                    about two months; these they call <q>hog shep-<br/>herds.</q></p>

                    of the way from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/jerus">Jerusalem<placename key="jerus"></placename></a> here,<br/> is their
                    land. We rode in the morning several miles<br/>in sight of the <geogname key="crook">Crooked Lake</geogname> to our right hand; and<br/>after riding
                    some distance we came in sight of it to<br/>our left, and saw where it empties
                    into <geogname key="mudla">Mud Lake</geogname>.<br/>Rode down near that to this
                    mill which is on the<br/>outlet called <geogname key="mudcr">Mud
                        Creek;</geogname> then rode down near the<br/>same to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jdols1">Dolson's<persname key="jdols1"></persname></a>, where it empties into the <geogname key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogname>;<br/>nine miles. On our way we passed several
                    little<br/>lakes, it being most of the way through a low piece<br/>of land
                    covered with lofty white pine, though not<br/>very large, and, I think, an
                    unhealthy place. Thirty-<br/>two miles.</p>

<p>I rose up out of bed about four o'clock this<br/>morning, haing had, I think, the
                    most unmerciful<br/>set of bed-fellows I ever experienced; for after I
                    found<br/>it was in vain to stand them battle, I submitted and<br/>surrendered
                    to them. But let me be as passive as I<br/> would, they gave me no quarter, but
                    continued to use<br/>their offensive weapons upon me full as much as if<br/>I
                    had been striving to aggravate them; until I<br/>thought best to plan a retreat,
                    and am glad to escape<br/>with whole bones, but am afraid some of them
                    will<br/>follow or keep with me all day. About six o'clock<br/>we all set off
                    and rode down the <geogname key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogname>twelve<br/>miles to
                    the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/ppost">Painted Post<placename key="ppost"></placename></a>, through a bottom of
                    pretty<br/>good land. Fed our horses and parted with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jjone1">JosephJones<persname key="jjone1"></persname></a>, who hath been an agreeable company thus

                    the way up the<br/><geogname key="tioga">Tioga</geogname>, twelve miles. At the

                    it<br/>eight or nine times, through a rich flat of land.<br/>Thence to the

                    de-<br/>serted and without inhabitant that we discovered, ex-<br/>cept one cat.
                    On examining the house, we chose to<br/>raise our tent, kindle a fire, and lie
                    on the ground,<br/>where we had a much more comfortable night than<br/>we should
                    have had if French Anthony had still<br/> lived there. Thirty-two miles.</p>

<p>A little before day-break it began to thun-<br/>der, and by the time it was light
                    enough to set off, it<br/> rained middling fast; but we could do no better
                    than<br/>to set off in it over the remainder of the <geogname key="savmo">Savage</geogname> or<br/><geogname key="allmo">Allegheny
                        Mountain</geogname>, it being a very bad road, though<br/>much better than
                    four years ago. It rained until we<br/>came to <geogname key="trout">Trout
                        Run</geogname>, nine miles from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/block">block-house<placename key="block"></placename></a>,<br/>which is at the foot or lowermost part of the
                    south<br/> side of that great mountain, which is twenty miles<br/>across from

                    rough and rocky in<br/>some places. We then rode down a narrow valley,<br/>down
                    which the aforesaid run descends, to Reynold's<br/>tavern, fifteen miles from
                    the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/block">block-house<placename key="block"></placename></a>. In about<br/>four miles'
                    riding down the valley, we crossed <geogname key="trout">Trout<br/>Run</geogname> thirty times. Here we breakfasted and
                    dined<br/>both at once. Thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/willi2">Williamsport<placename key="willi2"></placename></a>, fourteen miles,<br/>it being a place we passed

<p>Rode nine miles to<br/><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/welli1">Wm. Ellis's<persname key="welli1"></persname></a>, and put up
                    my mare, then walked one<br/>mile back to meeting. There I met all my

                    to dinner. In the<br/>afternoon I discovered my mare to be in such a

                    her to be foundered, sent for some tar<br/>and applied it in the usual way. Went

<p>My mare rather better, but not fit to ride.<br/>We set off; I walked and drove
                    her before me,<br/>and walked to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/milto">Milton<placename key="milto"></placename></a>, a
                    beautiful town on the bank<br/>of the west branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, sixteen<br/>miles, and dined. Thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sunb">Sunbury<placename key="sunb"></placename></a>, fourteen<br/>miles, and lodged; having
                    walked about twenty-five<br/>miles, my brethren spelling me some times.

                    the point between the west and the<br/>northeast branches of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogname>, which we<br/>passed through just before
                    we crossed the northeast<br/>branch and about two miles above <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sunb">Sunbury<placename key="sunb"></placename></a>. Had<br/>it not been that the situation of my
                    mare and walk-<br/>ing on foot occasioned some unpleasant sensations,
                    it<br/>would have been a very pleasant day's travel down<br/> the river through
                    a good deal of good land pretty<br/>well improved. I believe each of those three towns<br/>
<pb facs="SW_IC1799_Page_37" n="627"></pb>contains about one hundred houses
                    beautifully situa-<br/>ted, but I think <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/milto">Milton<placename key="milto"></placename></a> is the most so.

<p>Set off early on foot and left my companions<br/>to drive my mare. Directly
                    crossed <geogname key="shamo">Shamokin Creek</geogname><br/>and walked from the
                    town fourteen miles to Thuhns-<br/>man's tavern, the others coming there. About
                    three<br/>miles from said tavern crossed the <geogname key="mahac">Mahanoy</geogname>, and just<br/>by the inn, the <geogname key="swope">Swope Creek</geogname>. Thence to Little's tav-<br/>ern and ferry,
                    twenty-one miles, having walked about<br/>nineteen miles to-day. About midway of
                    the last<br/>stage crossed <geogname key="mahat">Mahontongo</geogname>, and
                    about a mile back<br/> from Little's crossed <geogname key="wicon">Wiconisco</geogname>. Almost all the way<br/> from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/sunb">Sunberry<placename key="sunb"></placename></a> here is, in my opinion, very poor land,<br/>both
                    mountains and valleys, notwithstanding some<br/>of it heretofore hath been
                    celebrated as excellent,<br/>being much of it set with scrubby pitch pine.
                    The<br/>fields in general look poor and dreary and the cattle<br/>mostly poor
                    with their hair standing the wrong way.<br/> Thirty-five miles.</p>

<p>Pursued my journey on foot, ten miles, in<br/>which I crossed <geogname key="petem"> Peter's Mountain</geogname>, where I mounted<br/>my invalid
                    mare and rode four miles to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mcall1">McAllister's<persname key="mcall1"></persname></a>.<br/>
                    The greater part of this stage very poor and some<br/>of it exceeding rough
                    land. When we arrived at<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/mcall1">McAllister's<persname key="mcall1"></persname></a>, I discovered on the sign in
                    large letters,<br/><q>The Practical Farmer</q>, which together with what<br/>I
                    had heard heretofore of the man's extent and pro-<br/> ficiency in agriculture,
                    raised my expectations of see-<br/>ing something extraordinary, but was very
                    much dis-<br/>appointed, the garden and barn excepted. Break-<br/>fasted and
                    rode six miles down the river through a<br/>beautiful country to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/harrisb">Harrisburg<placename key="harrisb"></placename></a>, a beautiful town on<br/>the bank of
                    the river, which I suppose contains 300<br/> houses; thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/middl">Middletown<placename key="middl"></placename></a>, nine miles, land very<br/>similar to the
                    last mentioned. This town, I suppose,<br/> contains about one hundred houses;
                    thence to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/eliza"> Eliza-bethtown,<placename key="eliza"></placename></a> eight miles.

                    crossed the beautiful <geogname key="swata">Swatara</geogname>. Here
                    we<br/>propose to lodge, and had it not been for the state<br/>my riding

<p>THE ingenuity which society exerts to surround<br/>with a glamour of romance the
                    horrible business of<br/>wholesale slaughter, is worthy of a better cause.
                    It<br/>was a lady--the Marchioness of Londonderry--who<br/>last week presented
                    new colors to a military company<br/>at Dublin. If it were possible to produce a
                    photo-<br/>graph of the carnage of a battlefield, no lady who<br/>saw it would
                    ever touch any part of the trappings of<br/>the agents in it.--The
