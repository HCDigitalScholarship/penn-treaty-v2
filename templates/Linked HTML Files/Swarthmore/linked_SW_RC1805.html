<p>This Rachel Coope manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed this manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: Miriam Lise Hauser. Transcriptions were compiled and
                    edited in the present form by Professor Murray. </p>
</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>This volume is actually a compilation by Rachel Coope's father, Joshua Sharpless,
                    taken after her death from her original journal and correspondence. Journals "a"
                    and "b," also in the collections of Friends Historical Library, represent
                    transcriptions of Rachel Coope’s actual diaries. Journal "a" her “esteemed
                    parents”; however, her mother died before the letter was written, and so it may
                    have been meant for her parents­in­law, to whom she was deeply attached) copied
                    over twice. No version of this letter is included in journal four. Except for
                    this, the differences were small, such as variance in phrasing and spelling, and
                    not in content. It seems as though journal "a" preceded journal "b"; it is less
                    polished. The handwriting seems more rushed and the paper size varies, while in
                    journal "b", the handwriting is neater, and the paper used is consistent. It is
                    possible that these, especially journal three, could have been handwritten by
                    Coope.</p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                Some account of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/rcoop1">Rachel Coope<persname key="rcoop1"></persname></a><br/> taken from
                    notes that she preserv’d, from<br/> her letters and from personal
                    knowledge.

                <p> She was the daughter of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar1">Joshua<persname key="jshar1"></persname></a> and<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/eshar1">Edith Sharpless<persname key="eshar1"></persname></a> and was born the 3rd of
                    the<br/> 5 mo 1771. About the 15th year of her age<br/> her mother was taken
                    from her by death,<br/> and the charge of her father’s family as<br/>
                    housekeeper, very much devolv’d upon<br/> her; the trial in both respects she
                    very<br/> sensibly felt, yet was enabled to con-<br/> duct her charge with
                    stability and pru-<br/> dence, and bear the loss of her dear mo<br/> ther, with
                    a becoming fortitude. For<br/> several years the charge of the family<br/>
                    rested upon her to which she attended<br/> like one of riper age. She was
                    cheerful in<br/> her disposition, and of a lively active turn<br/> of mind,
                    which being seasoned with the<br/> baptizing power of Truth, rendered her<br/>
                    company agreeable and instructive.</p>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_06" n="6"></pb>
<p> About the 21st year of her age she was<br/> married to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/bcoop1">Benjamin Coope<persname key="bcoop1"></persname></a>, and settled<br/> in the verge of
                        <orgname>Bradford meeting</orgname>, of<br/> which she was a diligent
                    attender, and<br/> increas’d in usefulness among them,<br/> labouring with
                    friends in supporting<br/> Church discipline, and visiting those who<br/> miss'd
                    their way. She several years acted<br/> as clerk to their mo. Meeting.</p>
<p> In the year <date when="1804">1804</date> information was<br/> sent down from
                    the yearly meeting to the<br/> quarterly and monthly meetings that the<br/>
                    settlement made by friends among the na-<br/> tives on the <geogname key="alleg">Allegany river</geogname> was now so advanced<br/> as to need the
                    assistance of females <del><gap></gap></del><br/>
<del><gap></gap></del> in instructing and exampleling<br/> their sex in domesting
                    concerns. request-<br/> ing that if a suitably qualifyed friend &amp;<br/> his
                    companion should feel their minds<br/> engaged in the concern to come forward as
                    vo-<br/> lunteers. When <del>it</del> information was spread in the monthly<br/>
                    and quarterly meetings of which she was a<br/> member her and her husband’s
                    minds became <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_07" n="7"></pb> so impress’d with it as to cause them
                    to<br/> believe it right to give it place. And on<br/> closely <add place="above">tending</add> to the concern it so ripened, as to<br/> make
                    them willing to lay their prospect<br/> before the friends of their monthly
                    meeting,<br/> for their sympathy and advise. Tho’ a<br/> close trial to their
                    friends to part with<br/> them yet upon weighty deliberation they<br/> judged it
                    best to leave them at liberty,<br/> to persue their religious prospects, as
                    way<br/> might open: which on closely attending<br/> too they believed it right
                    to prepare for<br/> the journey, and <del>was</del> were enabled to give up<br/>
                    a good and comfortable home, the society<br/> of their friends and near
                    relations to be<br/> found in the way of their duty. From<br/> the notes she
                    kept of her journey the follow-<br/> ing <del>is</del> are extracted.</p>

<p>
<q>After a time of comfortable<br/> quiet wherein we were favoured to feel
                        the<br/> overshadowings of Divine regard a number<br/> of our friends and
                        near relations being pre-<br/> sent we took leave of them in the feeling <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_08" n="8"></pb> embraces of endearing love: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ncoop1">Father Coope<persname key="ncoop1"></persname></a> bear-<br/> ing us company to

                        with him tears flow’d in an abun-<br/> dance, under a feeling sympathy
                        with<br/> him and ardent desires were raised in my<br/> heart, that he might
                        be enriched with that<br/> peace, now in his lonesome and advanc’d<br/>
                        stage of life, that is the precious enjoy-<br/> ment of the righteous: - We
                        lodged at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/wtrum1">William Truemans<persname key="wtrum1"></persname></a> where on my
                        going to bed I<br/> quietly fell asleep. but waking before three<br/>
                        Oclock, the remembrance of the parting scene<br/> so forcibly revived, that
                        tears could not be<br/> suppress'd, and sleep departed. Thou O my<br/> God
                            has<add>t</add> at seasons, in thy unmerrited<br/> goodness, been
                        pleased to make bare thy<br/> arm, and in times of trial, as patience<br/>
                        was abode in, offerd sweet consolation; un-<br/> der a humbling sense
                        thereof, may I a<br/> little intercede for the renew’d continuence<br/> of
                        thy love.</q> ---- On the evening of their<br/> second days journey she

<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_09" n="9"></pb> the roads &amp; the country, that I have
                    had<br/> but little serious reflections yet have not<br/> had unpleasant
                    sensations or enjoyed so<br/> large a portion of that precious conso-<br/>
                    lation, which my soul, above all things,<br/> desires. - O that I may abide in a
                    watch-<br/> ful state with my eye single to Him<br/> whose fatherly protection
                    is as a wall<br/> round about all those who are <unclear>severely</unclear><br/>

<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_10" n="10"></pb> in going out, and a valuable female

                        this<br/> way since we parted (exceping a few lines<br/> from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/middl">Middletown<placename key="middl"></placename></a>) yet it has not been for<br/> want of
                        affection, nay verily, the taking<br/> hold of thy hand when we parted,
                        was<br/> by far the closest trial I met with among all<br/> my near
                        relations, and for many miles<br/> I could not suppress the tears from
                        flow-<br/> ing -- Our moving here was from a sense <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_13" n="13"></pb> of duty.- The impressions were so
                        strong and<br/> at time would revive with such weight<br/> that I believ’d
                        it right for me to submit<br/> our going to our friends; had they
                        discoura-<br/> ged it I think I should have felt re-<br/> leased.-- My
                        sincere desire from the first<br/> was, that we might be guided by that<br/>
                        hand, that will lead all those rightly<br/> who rely thereon; and I thought
                        there<br/> was a comfortable degree of peace experien-<br/> ced in being
                        resigned: but the near sym-<br/> pathy I felt for thee, together with
                        the<br/> many trials I had to meet with, reduced<br/> me so low that, had my
                        request at a<br/> weak time been granted, I should not<br/> now be in a
                        state of mutibility.--<br/> I am very sensible, that thro’ unwatch-<br/>
                        fulness I have often err’d from the right<br/> way; yet have been made truly
                        thank-<br/> ful, that conviction followed; and at sea-<br/> sons been
                        enabled to renew covenant--<br/> but O the natural will, how strong,
                        how<br/> hard to be kept in its proper subjection, <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_14" n="14"></pb> that I have been ready at times to
                        cry<br/> out, must I always remain in a state<br/> of bondage.-- Oh may I
                        double my<br/> warfare and press forward with the hope,<br/> that, by the
                        aid of my heavenly Father, I<br/> shall be enabled to become a
                        conquerer;<br/> remembring <quote type="biblical">that in due time ye
                            shall<br/> reap if ye faint not.</quote>
<space></space> Being at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/phila">Philad a.<placename key="phila"></placename></a><br/> on
                        business a week before we set off – at a<br/> friends house we very
                        unexpectedly met<br/> with <persname>WC</persname>-- who had something
                        peculiarly<br/> encourag<del>e</del>ing to say to us; signifying that<br/>
                        he felt so much sympathy and love to<br/> flow towards us when at dinner
                        that he<br/> could not go up stairs without expressing<br/> it tho’ he
                        several times attempted it--<br/> he address’d my husband with the

<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_15" n="15"></pb> extraordinary after such a season of
                        con-<br/> flict we had had to pass thro’ that we<br/> should meet with such

                        is not suf-<br/> ficient to rely upon, yet I have witness’d<br/> some
                        refreshing seasons since parting<br/> with thee, particularly in our

<p> In a letter to me she says <q>Last<br/> spring several acres of Oats with
                        Timothy<br/> and Cloverseed with it were sow’d-- ½ a bushel of<br/>
                        Buckwheat- and some potatoes and corn<br/> planted- all grew amazingly-- It
                        has<br/> been a busy summer with us both men<br/> and women; the forepart of
                        it we had at<br/> work a carpenter and mill right and a<br/> number of
                        Indians diging at the race.<br/> It is very heavy work to clear land here,
                        &amp;<br/> it is surprizing to see the quantity of saw<br/> logs a few acres
                        produces-- About 13 <unclear>acres</unclear><br/> is put in with wheat. --
                        Potatoes, pump-<br/> kins and turnips we have in a bundance <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_16" n="16"></pb> they will be helpful in the way of
                        fod-<br/> der. the oats likewise was mow'd for foddering.-<br/> It has not
                        been in our power to render the<br/> natives much assistance this summer;
                        yet<br/> I have no doubt our being here, has been<br/> useful.- We have spun
                        some stocking wool<br/> for our own use: to se the wool converted in-<br/>
                        to stocking has excited their astonishment.<br/> We have three little wheels
                        ready to run when<br/> we get flax.-- We purpose this winter puting<br/> up
                        a house near us for those Indians who<br/> wish to learn, to spin &amp;c
                        in.- They appear<br/> desirous to get more comfortable houses to<br/> live
                        in- and for that purpose have bought<br/> many 100 ft. of boards.- When the
                        young<br/> men first came here, the cattle were all the<br/> Indians had on
                        their river.- They will<br/> now amount to several 100, a number of<br/>
                        which are fine oxen which they have <unclear>broke</unclear>.<br/> I have
                        endeavored to discribe the man-<br/> ner of our geting along, and what we
                        have<br/> done. I will intimate a little to thee now <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_17" n="17"></pb> how I have fared.- Thou knew it
                        was<br/> a close tryal to me, to give up to be thus<br/> separated from you;
                        and I have often been<br/> made thankful that I <hi rend="underline">was</hi> favoured to<br/> get into a state of resignation. I think<br/>
                        I never enjoy'd a more comfortable state of<br/> mind, than since residing
                        here.-- One first<br/> day eve afternoon when they were long I feeling
                        the<br/> want of society to introduce a new train<br/> of ideas for the mind
                        to dwell on - a little<br/> before the sun withdrew from us his rays.<br/> I
                        walked out alone, seeking for some new<br/> objects to amuse me and persued
                        the new<br/> road about ¾ of a mile to the river. as I<br/> walk'd along my
                        mind unintentionally<br/> was engaged, in ruminating on my native<br/> home,
                        my dear relations and friends, and<br/> why I should be thus seperated
                        from<br/> them.-- I was satisfy'd that it did not<br/> proceed from any will
                        of my own but<br/> much in the cross, and in submission<br/> to inward
                        impressions.- As I was thus <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_18" n="18"></pb> musing my heart was fill'd with a
                        preci-<br/> ous illumination, and self so reduced, that<br/> I felt willing
                        to make a full surrender of<br/> my all, to the great and wise disposer of
                        events<br/> but alass, this produced awful sensations;<br/> and I was ready
                        to shudder at the prospect;<br/> when unexpectedly and unsought for a<br/>
                        language reviv'd, “Fear thou not neither be<br/> dismay'd. I will strengthen
                        thee, yea I will<br/> help thee, my grace is sufficient for thee.”<br/> O
                        the Divine consolation that fill’d my<br/> breast.- Tho’ as to the outward
                        it might<br/> look lonesome; being in the wilderness-<br/> far from society-
                        some distance from the<br/> house and nearly dark: yet had I been<br/> in
                        the midst of my friends no outward<br/> enjoyment could have been equal to
                        the<br/> precious sweetness I then experienced--<br/> my heart overflow'd
                        with gratitude-- any<br/> subtle petitions asconded for the continu-<br/>
                        ations of his love, Tho’ felt unworthy of<br/> the least of the multiplied
                        favours I am <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_19" n="19"></pb> receiving: may humility and reverence
                        be<br/> ascribed to him alone who is forever worthy,<br/> Amen -- I have my
                        bitters as well as<br/> my sweets, and tryals are necessary for my<br/>
                        further refinement, and Oh that their may<br/> be a willingness to be
                        searched and tried,<br/> untill every thing that is contrary to the<br/>
                        pure truth, is done away--</q></p>
<p> To some near connections <q>Dear Chil-<br/> dren, we that have been brought up
                        in the<br/> plentiful enjoyment of this worlds pro-<br/> duce, and many
                        other advantages, have<br/> abundant cause to be thankful. Oh how<br/> I
                        have felt for many poor children that<br/> I have seen since I left home;
                        particularly<br/> thro’ the course of our journey, but we<br/> must leave
                        them to Providence who is<br/> the great superintendent of the
                        Universe.<br/> We have mostly since being here enjoy'd<br/> good health, and
                        live comfortably tho’<br/> much retired.-- have not got much engag'd<br/> in
                        instructing the Indians; it will require <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_20" n="20"></pb> some time to learn their language

<p> To a friend - <q>Thy letter of <date when="1805-07">7 mo</date> last<br/> came
                        safe to hand. The wholesome counsel<br/> together with the interesting
                        information,<br/> was truly acceptable; for it reached me at<br/> a time
                        when I was very desirous of hearing<br/> from my native home; being of the
                        latest<br/> date of any I had received -- I was pleas'd<br/> to find thou
                        hadst been to see my dear<br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ncoop1">father Coope<persname key="ncoop1"></persname></a> for whose situation I have
                        near-<br/> by felt; knowing it was a close trial both<br/> to him and us, to
                        be thus separated,<br/> now in his advanced stage of life.<br/> Indeed when
                        I view'd the prospect not<br/> only of leaving <hi rend="underline">him</hi>
                        but society in gen-<br/> eral, with my dear friends and relations,<br/> to
                        many of whom I have of late felt<br/> an increasing nearness, with desires
                        for the<br/> advancement of our Zion, and to live so<br/> retired in an
                        uncultivated part of the coun-<br/> try, was so in the cross, that at times
                        I <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_21" n="21"></pb> was almost ready to run counter to
                        se-<br/> cret impressions; but knowing my peace<br/> consisted in obedience;
                        and remembring<br/> how it was with good old Jacob: when<br/> he left his
                        father’s house to go into a<br/> strange country, that in the course of<br/>
                        his journey, when alone, he had to ac-<br/> knowledge, “surely the Lord is
                        in this<br/> place and I knew it not.”- and how<br/> he was preserv'd and
                        bless'd, so that on<br/> his returning, he said, "I am not worthy of
                        the<br/> least of thy mercies, for with my staff<br/> I passed over this
                        Jordon, and now I<br/> am become two bands.”-- As these con-<br/>
                        siderations reviv'd with renew'd faith,<br/> that the Divine presence, is
                        still the<br/> same that ever it was, to those who<br/> are truly devoted to
                        serve the Most<br/> High. - my faith was a little<br/> strengthened, the
                        mountains gradually<br/> disappear'd and a belief increas'd, that<br/> if it
                        was the Lords will for us to go, <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_22" n="22"></pb> he would support us if our eye
                        were<br/> fixed upon him. -- Thus as I endea-<br/> voured to become
                        resigned. I felt at sea-<br/> sons a comfortable consolation, and have<br/>
                        experienced, even in this remote part of<br/> the country, a brook by the
                        way, that<br/> will refresh the weary traveler.-- Our re-<br/> ligious
                        opportunities are mostly attended<br/> with a lively savour. It is
                        encouraging<br/> to hear that the petitions of those who<br/> have been <add place="above">&amp; still are</add> as valiants in our Israel are<br/>
                        ascending on our behalf.- Surely it calls<br/> for grateful returns of
                        thankfulness to<br/> the Author of all good.-</q></p>
<p>
<q>The natives appear friendly disposed<br/> and are gradually increasing in the
                        ideas<br/> of civilized life.-- Some of them are much<br/> spirited in
                        cultivating their farms and<br/> in geting more comfortable
                    houses.--</q></p>
<p>
<q>The concern feels weighty and impor-<br/> tant, and I have no doubt but that
                        it<br/> was rightly founded; and if those engag'd <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_23" n="23"></pb> therein are careful to dwell near the
                        Divine<br/> direction they will be preserved; and may<br/> at a future day
                        have to view their labours<br/> with satisfaction.</q></p>

<p> In answer to her brother <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar2">JS<persname key="jshar2"></persname></a> who<br/> desired
                    to be informed of the customs &amp; man-<br/> -ners of the natives-- says
                        <q>Since the young<br/> men resided here, the natives had a great<br/> image
                        cut out of a Pine tree and made<br/> after the figure of a man, and
                        painted,<br/> so as to look frightful, which they call'd<br/> the Great
                        Spirit. They had set times of<br/> worshiping and dancing before it.
                        But<br/> as their minds became more enlighten'd<br/> some of them grew
                        uneasy with<br/> this image, and they had many confer-<br/> ences what
                        should be done with it; but<br/> they were fearful of destroying it,
                        lest<br/> some evil should befall them.- At<br/> length one of their chiefs
                        proposed taking<br/> it into the woods and puting some beans<br/> and corn
                        by it, to shew their good will <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_24" n="24"></pb> for it. Hence after much debate

                        why this image you worship was once<br/> a little sprout that grew out of
                        the ground<br/> it could neither hear nor speak - well it was<br/> made like
                        a man and we worship it still<br/> it can neither hear nor speak- is this
                        the<br/> sort of Great Spirit we worship, cant hear can’t<br/> speak - give
                            <hi rend="underline">me</hi> leave and I will make way<br/> with it.- At

<q>Various reflections pass'd thro’ my<br/> mind to day as I sat knitting, of
                        which<br/> the following is a part-- At this lone- <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_25" n="25"></pb> some hour when the watery clouds
                        are<br/> discharging their whitened substance<br/> and the trees of the

                        with the cares of this life - and<br/> my thoughts absorbed in awful
                        medita-<br/> tion- may I view all temporary scenes<br/> as fading toys, and
                        revere that hand<br/> from whom all good comes- Now at<br/> this solemn

                        inward teacher -- O my faultering<br/> mind, how long wilt thou be
                        blundering<br/> along in thy journey Heavenward. thou<br/> hast often seen
                        this insufficience of hu-<br/> man frailty therefore in full confi-<br/>

                        precious.--<br/> And now O Lord permit me to intercede<br/> for a renewal of
                        thy holy aid, that<br/> when thou in thy wisdom may see<br/> mete to hide,
                        as it were, thy face from <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_26" n="26"></pb> me I may be enabled, in patience<br/>
                        and humility to wait for thy coming;<br/> and when thou art pleased to be
                        near<br/> and feed me I may not slide from<br/> the true path; for in thee
                        and thee<br/> alone is safety.</q>-</p>

<q>All things as to the out-<br/> ward glide comfortably along but I<br/> have
                        often to pass thro’ seasons of deep<br/> humiliation. -- Thou <add place="above">only</add> Lord knows the<br/> anguish of my spirit and

                        altho’ the weather much of the time since<br/> has been stormy and the

<q>As soap making is a novel to most <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_28" n="28"></pb> of the Indians nay many of them<br/>
                        seldom or never wash their clothes or even<br/> their hands or face- To
                        impress their<br/> minds with <space></space> habits of cleanliness appear'd<br/>
                        to us the first necessary and important<br/> step- accordingly in the fall
                        we proposed<br/> to them, to save their ashes and fat, and when<br/> our
                        house was ready we would teach them<br/> to make soap – for when they bring
                        their grists<br/> to mill in their canoes the materials could<br/> easily be
                        brought with in them – for they<br/>
<del>generally</del> live 10 or 12 m each way generally on the<br/> oppesite

                        appear'd<br/> anxious to learn- they were much pleas'd<br/> with having a

<q>Dear cousin, Previous to the<br/> reception of thy letter, the tidings
                        of<br/> the decease of your precious sister had<br/> reached us- and I
                        feelingly sympathiz'd<br/> with you. Truly it must be a great con-<br/>
                        solation in believing she was prepar'd<br/> for her awful change, which I
                        have no<br/> doubt was the case. Oh that it may<br/> have an awakening
                        tendency on those of<br/> her contemporaries who attended the<br/> solemn
                        scene. Tryals of this sort and<br/> many others frequently occur during <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_31" n="31"></pb> our pilgrimage thro’ life; but it
                        is<br/> written all things will work together<br/> for good to them who love
                        and fear the<br/> Lord.</q> --</p>
<p>
<q>The Indians are increasing in in-<br/> dustreous habits. At a late council<br/>
<del>they</del> held among themselves they agreed<br/> and information was
                        sent to the absent<br/> tees - that at a certain stated time<br/> each one
                        mut relinquesh their hunting<br/> and be in readiness to attend to the<br/>
                        labors of the field, being sensible that<br/> last spring a loss was
                        sustained by<br/> not earlier applying themselves to it</q></p>

<p> To me <q>Thou requested an infor-<br/> matory letter respecting both ourselves
                        &amp;<br/> the improvements of the natives: as to<br/> the latter but little
                        advancement is yet<br/> made among the females-not owing I<br/> think to our
                        neglect- the charge we are<br/> intrusted with by our society and
                        expect<br/> ed to give samples of its concern we often <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_32" n="32"></pb> feel weighty and important - and
                        have<br/> set times to confer together with a<br/> view, to keep the subject
                        lively, and to<br/> seek after a plan, that may be most<br/> conducive to
                        their improvement.- and<br/> often among ourselves express a concern<br/>
                        that we do so little.- yet when we reflect<br/> that we are endeavouring to
                        do the best<br/> we can, labouring to keep in the patience,<br/> improving
                        every favourable opportunity<br/> that may offer - way may yet open for<br/>
                        our encouragement -- The children<br/> of Israel in their journey thro’ the
                        wil-<br/> derness were directed when they saw<br/> no way to go forward to
                        stand still.<br/> and way open'd beyond their expectation.</q></p>
<p>
<q>I have had for some time past hum-<br/> bly to crave for patience both
                        inwardly<br/> and outwardly, and have laboured to<br/> seek after that
                        wisdom that is able to<br/> direct-- Thou knowest there are sea-<br/> sons
                        when discouragements will assails us in <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_33" n="33"></pb> all weighty undertakings but if we

                        permitted to<br/> shine as our of a dark place -- and to<br/> own the
                        necessity of those proving sea-<br/>sons and not to glory in any act of<br/>
                        our own—</q></p>
<p>
<q>I do not mean to convey discourage-<br/>ments relative to the concern-- for I
                        think<br/> the work is progressing-- but great matters<br/> all at once must
                        not be looked for.<br/> Many of the men this spring appear in<br/> good

                        not receiv'd<br/> a visit from him since he was intrusted<br/> with his

                        have an interview with him.<br/> The next day after his arival at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/colds">Cold spring<placename key="colds"></placename></a><br/> he had the Indians collected
                        (our men at-<br/> tended). He communicated many pertinent<br/> remarks to
                        them, suitably adapted to their<br/> capacities; endeavouring to impress on
                        their<br/> minds, the advantage of industry and<br/> sobriety, and the
                        cultivation of their land.<br/> Requesting them to be careful to bring <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_35" n="35"></pb> up their children to labor;
                        endeavouring<br/> to convince them of the advantage it<br/> is to farmers to
                        live seperate from each<br/> other and not in little towns. -- A sil-<br/>
                        versmith had made many exertions<br/> to settle among the Indians,
                        which<br/> we entirely disapproved - - The <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/ichap1">Agent<persname key="ichap1"></persname></a><br/> desired them not to suffer him to come<br/> on
                        their land, for we would get their<br/> money for broaches and bobs
                        that<br/> would be of no use to them. for when<br/> they wanted a yoke of
                        oxen, if they<br/> had money they could go among the<br/> white people and
                        get them, but if<br/> you take a basketfull of these broach-<br/> es they
                        will not take them.- he also descanted<br/> on the great benifit of having
                        the Qua-<br/> kers among them, and the advantages<br/> of the mills;
                        signifying there were no<br/> people who had done more for them<br/> than

<p> To her sister <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/eshar1">ES<persname key="eshar1"></persname></a> -- <q>The recital of thy<br/>
                        short excersion in the country revived a<br/> recent visit made by me to
                            <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/colds">Cold Spring<placename key="colds"></placename></a><br/> an Indian town- and
                        I was led to<br/> view the contrast- As true a picture of<br/> mine cannot
                        be formed in <add place="above">thy</add> ideas, as<br/> thine can in mine--
                        however to make<br/> a begining -- As the cornfields have lately<br/> call'd
                        the attention of the women from<br/> their spining it afforded us some
                        leisure;<br/> and I seized the opportunity to visit<br/>
<space></space> them in their own houses- <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob
                            Taylor<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a><br/> going on business to the town, and offer'd<br/>
                        to escort me there-- when we came to the<br/>
<geogname key="alleg">river</geogname> an Indian with a canoe being
                        there<br/> who cheerfully took us across- I had a<br/> pleasant walk up the
                            <geogname key="alleg">river</geogname>, viewing the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_38" n="38"></pb>
<geogname key="allmo">mountains</geogname> on the opposite side
                        intermix'd<br/> with narrow vallies clothed with spontaness<br/> herbage for
                        the nourishment of the dumb<br/> beasts-- when we arived in the
                        subburbs<br/> of the town we were haild by some of the<br/> inhabitants to
                        know where we were bound<br/> to- <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jtayl1">Jacob<persname key="jtayl1"></persname></a>
                        inform'd them that I purposed<br/> spending the day among them, and by
                        and<br/> by would call on <hi rend="underline">them</hi>- as his business
                        did<br/> not lead him far thro’ the town, he shew me the house I was<br/>
                        bound too then left me- Mockensons I<br/> have found to be a pleasant
                        covering for<br/> the feet in dry weather and my last sum-<br/> mers pair
                        being worn out, I call'd on this<br/> woman who made them, to be speak
                        an-<br/> other pair-- when I came to the door, I<br/> saluted her in their
                        way. <hi rend="underline">schano</hi> ah schano<br/> she reply'd- looking
                        pleasantly- her five<br/> little folks being aroud- I invited my<br/> self
                        in, also to a seat which I took on<br/> the end of a long bench- the day
                        was<br/> warm yet she was churning close by the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_39" n="39"></pb> fire-- I regreted the want of their
                        lan-<br/> guage to instruct her how to manage it.<br/> I cannot converse
                        with them tho’ make<br/> some awkward attempts-- when she was<br/>
<add>done</add> she took her seat by me admiring my knit-<br/> ting which I
                        had in my hand- I also<br/> (on purpose for them to try) had provided<br/>
                        an other stocking which I then handed<br/> her, using my utmost endeavours
                        to instruct<br/> her. she was, tho’ intent in learning very<br/> awkward-
                        one of her neighbours coming in<br/> tryed it also - but to return - after
                        churn-<br/> ing was done she washed a bowl, and with<br/> the assistance of
                        a ladle collected and<br/> slightly worked the butter- then pour'd<br/> it
                        (for it was like oil) into a pail of<br/> water, where it remained a few
                        minutes<br/> then she again worked it with her ladle<br/> and salting it she
                        sat it by me on the<br/> end of the bench (there being perhaps 4lb)<br/>
                        with a piece of unleavened corn bread<br/> and an old knife, and invited me
                        to dine <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_40" n="40"></pb> giving me for drink- buttermilk (how

                        (perhaps 10 and 12 years of age)<br/> who had frequently been at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/places/tunes">Tunesassah<placename key="tunes"></placename></a> came<br/> inviting me to their house.
                        they ran before<br/> and prepared a seat for me by their mo-<br/> ther who
                        was sitting at the door weaving<br/> a belt curiously decorated with
                        beads.<br/> The eldest impatient to try <hi rend="underline">her</hi> hand

                        fingers- in a few<br/> minutes she performed much better than<br/> the woman
                        did in half an hour-- when<br/> she got in the way of it I left it with
                        her<br/> and made several visits in the upper<br/> part of the town. When I
                        return'd she<br/> told me by her fingers that she had knit<br/> six needles-
                        and that 30 stitches were on a<br/> needle-- she reluctantly parted with
                        it<br/> but time urged me homewards, having<br/> on my way several calls yet

<q>I had victuals at another place set for me<br/> which my paper, as I have in
                        view some other<br/> thing to mention to thee, will give me no<br/> room to
                        describe. I got thro’ and to the<br/> fording place about six- where 2
                        families<br/> live who in turn were to share of my visit<br/> and who I
                        expected to take me across the<br/>
<geogname rend="alleg">river</geogname> - but my expectations were
                        erroneous<br/> for the houses were shut and no one to take<br/> me over--
                        here alone, I took my seat and bun-<br/> dle of shingles waiting for some
                        favour-<br/> able event -- with which in ½ an hour I was finish-<br/> ed,
                        for an Indian coming to the opposite<br/> side got a canoe and took me over-
                        and<br/> I returned much pleased with my visits--<br/> ------ We had the
                        assistance of 10 or more<br/> Indians for 2 day in raising a barn - the<br/>
                        day of the eclipse proved to be one- the<br/> Indians had been told some
                        time before<br/> that on this day the sun would grow<br/> dark- but some
                        said “they were sure white<br/> people could tell no such things,” however <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_42" n="42"></pb> when the obscuration began it
                        continued<br/> growing darker and darker untill for a<br/> few minutes it
                        became total the atmos-<br/> phere resembled dark twilight and a<br/> number
                        of stars made their appearances.<br/> well says one of the Indians the

                            dispensations<br/> I have experienced since being here,<br/> thought my

                            that ma<br/> ny comfortable hours have been sacri-<br/> ficed to these

<q>About two weeks ago the com-<br/> mittee left us, and three days since
                        my<br/> dear <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/jshar2">brother<persname key="jshar2"></persname></a>. I sensibly feel the
                        strip,<br/> the sweets that are to be derived from<br/> society, and in the
                        company of our near<br/> relations assumed their native force,<br/> and so
                        powerfully prevailed that had I<br/> indulged those impressions they
                        would<br/> soon have made me discontented and<br/> unhappy in my present
                        retired situati-<br/> on, and for a season they did unsettle <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_50" n="50"></pb> my mind; but as I endeavoured to
                        cast<br/> them of and seek for that resignation<br/> which had heretofore
                        not only proved as a<br/> consolation but at seasons as a healing<br/>
                        cordial to my relaxed mind, I was<br/> led to view the motive and cause why
                        I<br/> was thus sepperated and a comfortable<br/> submission ensued. I was
                        favour'd to<br/> experience the precious overshadowing of<br/> Divine love,
                        my mind was humbled<br/> under the Heavenly canopy, and for a few<br/> days
                        I seldom have experienc'd so quiet a<br/> repose. Oh may I be enabled to
                        render<br/> the gratitude that is due to my great and<br/> good Benefactor
                        for the many favours<br/> dispens'd to me a poor unworthy creature.</q></p>

<q>To a niece who had lately lost her<br/> companion. -- The perusal of thy
                        val-<br/> uable letter was truly satisfactory. It<br/> was comfortable to
                        find that thou was<br/> favoured with so much fortitude and<br/>
                        resignation. It is enough my dear to<br/> experience a Physician near to
                        heal all<br/> our maladies; may we in our varied<br/> allotments daily
                        endeavour so to walk,<br/> as to witness our minds more and more<br/>
                        redeemed from the perishing enjoyments<br/> of this world. For what is self
                        with all its<br/> acquired arts or what is there here that<br/> is worth
                        placing our dependance on.</q></p>
<p>
<q>The winter thus far with us has been<br/> very severe -- The ground these
                        three months<br/> past been covered with snow. - but we have <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_52" n="52"></pb> a good warm house to shelter us from
                        the<br/> northern blasts.</q></p>
<p>
<q>A number of Indian girls has this<br/> winter given us their company -
                        some<br/> of whom has made an incouraging prog-<br/> ress - a short piece is
                        now in the loom<br/> principally the industry of two girls.<br/> - another
                        piece is on the way - and a con-<br/> siderable quantity of very good
                        thread<br/> has been manufacter'd and distributed<br/> among them generally.
                        - Those two<br/> girls are desirous of having wheels of<br/> their own, and
                        spin at home - and<br/> their request we mean to grant.</q></p>
<p>
<q>Altho’ the disposition among the<br/> men to relieve their women in the<br/>
                        labour of the field, has greatly en-<br/> creas'd; yet when the time for
                        plant-<br/> ing corn comes, the females have to<br/> give their assistance
                        more or less, thro’<br/> the summer. still there are intervals<br/> if they
                        were so disposed, that might <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_53" n="53"></pb> be devoted to spinning knitting
                        &amp;c<br/> an increas of exertion on their part<br/> would <space></space> be

<p> To her parents. -- <q>I have<br/> been thinkin whether in my situa-<br/> tion,

                        is mostly good, and my<br/> mind resign'd, for which favours<br/> I am truly

                    being raised was small.<br/> after a<br/> short pause she reply'd - <q>I would

                        return'd with him to our friends; <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_57" n="57"></pb> but if it is not to be so I feel
                        resign'd.<br/> I said my dear child I hope and believe<br/> thou art

                        resign'd and have<br/> my mind prepared if such a change<br/> should take
                        place- and I now feel quite<br/> easy under a full belief that there is
                        a<br/> place of rest prepared for me.</q> A while<br/> after she looked very
                    affectionately at me<br/> and said <q>My dear father, I am glad<br/> thou art
                        here. I heard of thy being poor-<br/> ly, and was fearful thou wouldst

                        will get safely home.</q></p>
<p> Notwithstanding her very tryed situation<br/> her mind seem'd carried above it
                    compos'd<br/> and resign'd with no dejection in her<br/> countenance. -- The

                    he was sent for.<br/> The Doctors on confering together, believ'd<br/> it not in
                    their power to give her relief.<br/> After they had come to this conclusion<br/>
                    I took my seat by her bedside. she<br/> look'd a few minutes at me then,<br/>
                    with her natural voice and much sim-<br/> plicity asked me what the doctors
                    thought<br/> of her. I told her, her situation was<br/> so difficult they
                    apprehended they could<br/> administer no relief. she reply'd<br/> why do they
                    think so? - then pausing<br/> awhile said <q>I must be content</q> and<br/> in a
                    short time adding, <q>I feel resign'd.</q></p>
<p> She delivered herself with much ease and<br/> freedom, not appearing to be

                    and taking her <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_59" n="59"></pb> by the hand said, <q>Well Rachel I

                        done the best thou couldst.<br/></q> he then asked her if she felt

<q>but it is a trial to me to leave my<br/> dear husband so far from his

                        necessary then for us always<br/> to be prepar'd.</q> -- Being some
                    reliev'd<br/> the forepart of this (which was the third<br/> of her sickness)
                    she was cheerful tho’ very<br/> sweet giving her sister directions about<br/>
                    some things, also saying to her sister<br/>
<q>it is my request that you will ever<br/> remember my dear <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/bcoop1">Benjamin<persname key="bcoop1"></persname></a> as a <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_60" n="60"></pb> brother for he has been a very kind
                        hus-<br/> band to me and I have often profited<br/> by his instructive
                        conversation.</q></p>
<p> On the fourth day of her illness a change<br/> took place and for a few day the
                    flattering<br/> expectation that her life would be pre-<br/> serv'd was
                    indulged, but a fever with<br/> some other unfavourable symptoms seiz'd<br/> her
                    which seemed to baffle all the efforts<br/> that was given for her relief, and
                    felt nature<br/> not having strength to resist yielded to their<br/> powerful
                    assaults. -- she weaken'd fast<br/> yet appear'd to lay with an easy mind.<br/>
                    her bodily pain was great and hav-<br/> ing found some relief by being
                    mov'd<br/> often made the request. She would<br/> look very affectionately at me
                    at times<br/> and say, <q>Well father I feel very un-<br/> easy, I believe I
                        must be mov'd a little,<br/> I suppose thou wilt think me very<br/>
                        bothersome, but it gives me some relief.</q><br/> Tho’ it was moving to see
                    her so <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_61" n="61"></pb> afflicted yet I was glad I was with<br/>
                    her, she appear'd so much in the inno-<br/> cency, no anxiety manifested
                    concern-<br/> ing her situation, her mind much<br/> resign'd and a willingness
                    to comply<br/> and act just as was thought best.</p>
<p> The day she deceas'd her pain much<br/> abating, she lay more easy tho’ a
                    high<br/> fever was still her companion which<br/> so affected her mind as to
                    cause it to<br/> be much affloat particularly when in<br/> a doze. About three
                    Oclock she appear'd<br/> in fervent supplication tho’ not clearly<br/>
                    understood, and frequently in the few<br/> remaining hours that she continued
                    with<br/> us her mind was similarly engag'd<br/> not only interceding for
                    herself but others<br/> which fully evinced that her day would<br/> close in
                    peace. About this time her<br/> hands and feet began to grow cold,<br/> and her
                    pulse to beat more feebly tho’<br/> very quick. I ask'd her if she knew <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_62" n="62"></pb> we were waiting to see her close. she<br/>
                    said where are you waiting? I answer’d<br/> around her bed. She reply'd <q>I am
                        very<br/> low</q> -- About half an hour before her<br/> departure I took
                    hold of her hand to<br/> feel if she had a pulse, apprehending<br/> she was too
                    far gone to notice it, but<br/> she asked if she had any fever. I replied<br/>
                    not much -- I then ask'd if she felt<br/> very sick she answer'd no. I think
                    I<br/> feel a little recruited, am pretty easy<br/> and if I had a good place to
                    lay I<br/> could go to sleep - I said <q>my dear child,<br/> thou wilt soon be
                        in a sweet sleep.<br/></q> she replied <q>I believe I shall</q> -- at<br/>
                    this time a cold sweat was pouring<br/> from her - and shortly after she said<br/>
<q>I am in such a perspiration that<br/> I cannot get my mind composed.<br/> I
                        want to have it settled</q>- having<br/> frequently thro’ the course of the
                    day<br/> expressed the same desire -- she present- <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_63" n="63"></pb> -ly call'd for a cup of tea - which
                    was<br/> brought to her - but she was in so great<br/> a tremor that it was with
                    much diffi-<br/> culty she drank it, and being sensible of<br/> her situation
                    she said, <q>I am so discom-<br/> posed that I can scarcely drink it.</q><br/>
                    then having a little more she said <q>that<br/> is sufficient.</q> -- she then
                    altered very<br/> fast, - and in a few minutes without<br/> struggle, sigh or
                    groan quietly breath'd<br/> her last. ---- Thus this hand-<br/> maid of the
                    Lord, in the meridian of<br/> life, being in the 36th year of her age<br/>
                    closed her days and is now without a<br/> doubt receiving the rewards of her
                    faith-<br/> fulness.</p>
<p> A number of the Indian women<br/> from the first of her illness untill her<br/>
                    close manifested much concern for her<br/> recovery, - bringing different kinds
                    of<br/> herbs and roots for her relief as well as<br/> giving from time to time
                    their best <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_64" n="64"></pb> advice; and when they heard she was<br/>
                    no more, their countenances manifest-<br/> ed much sorrow. ---- She departed<br/>
<date when="1807-08-16">16 of the 8mo 1807</date>, ---- the next<br/> day being
                    fixed on for her burial, invi-<br/> tations were sent among the In-<br/> dians,
                    &amp; near 20 of the graver sort attend'd<br/> principally women, a number
                    coming<br/> into the room, and after looking at the<br/> corps in much
                    brokenness quietly took<br/> their seats untill it was closed, which<br/> was
                    not untill after a time of solemn<br/> silence.- Several of the Indians who<br/>
                    did not come in sent their excuse<br/> saying, They could not bear to see
                    her<br/> for the sight would overcome them and<br/> they would weep aloud. They
                    follow'd<br/> to the grave in the same becoming<br/> manner. -- They return’d
                    into the room<br/> and took their seats for I suppose<br/> 15 minutes. They were
                    then serv'd with<br/> fresh bread and in a few minutes <br/>
<pb facs="SW_RC1805_Page_65" n="65"></pb> after individually shook ha<add place="above">n</add>ds with<br/> us and bade us farewell, some of<br/> them
                    saying to us that they were very<br/> sorry Rachel was taken away but en-<br/>
                    couraged us to bear the trial patiently<br/> for such things must happen to
                    the<br/> white people as well as the Indians.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/cornp2">Cornplanter<persname key="cornp2"></persname></a> lived down the <geogname key="alleg">river</geogname><br/> about 12 miles and he came in a few<br/>
                    days to see us. his countenance mani-<br/> fested him to be a true
                    sympathizer.<br/> he said he was very sorry for what<br/> had happened among us
                    and hoped<br/> we would not be discourage for this<br/> was the first since the
                    settlement<br/> was made among them and that<br/> such tryals would be the lot
                    of white<br/> folks as well as Indians. he took<br/> leave of us with tears in
                    his eyes.</p>
