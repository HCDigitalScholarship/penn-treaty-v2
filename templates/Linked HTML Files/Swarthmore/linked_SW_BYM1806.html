                ADVERTISEMENT.
                <p>Since putting to press a London Edition of<br/>"A brief Account of the
                    Proceedings of the<br/>"Committee appointed in the Year <date when="1795">1795</date>, by<br/>"the Yearly Meeting of Friends of Pennsyl-<br/>"vania,
                    New Jersey, &amp;c. for promoting the<br/>"Improvement and gradual Civilization
                    of the<br/>"Indian Natives," an account of the proceed-<br/>ings of a committee,
                    appointed by another<br/>Yearly Meeting in North America, has been<br/>received.
                    In presenting it to the English reader,<br/>a few remarks may be useful.</p>
<p>The <orgname key="bym">Yearly Meeting held at <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a></orgname>, in<br/><a href="/places/maryl">Maryland<placename key="maryl"></placename></a>, is quite distinct from <orgname key="pym">that held
                            at<br/><a href="/places/phila">Philadelphia<placename key="phila"></placename></a></orgname>; yet it
                    represents a considerable<br/>part of the body of Friends in the western
                    part<br/>of <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>. The objects of the
                    concern of<br/>the two Yearly Meetings are equally distinct.<br/>The Indian
                    nations to which the Maryland com-<br/>mittee has directed its attention, lie in
                    general<br/>farther west, than those under the notice of the<br/>Pennsylvanians.
                    They are situated in that vast<br/>district which is comprehended between
                    the<br/>rivers <geogname key="ohior">Ohio</geogname> and <geogname key="missi">Mississippi</geogname>, and bounded to<br/>the north by the lakes <geogname key="lakes">Superior</geogname>, <geogname key="lakeh">Huron</geogname>,
                        and<br/><geogname key="lakee">Erie</geogname>. <geogname key="lakem">Lake
                        Michigan</geogname> penetrates this district,<br/>and may be said to be
                    wholly within it. It has<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_004" n="4"></pb>been called the North-Western
                    Territory; and<br/>was not long ago the scene of an Indian war; but<br/>peace
                    was established by a treaty at <a href="/places/greenv">Greeneville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a><br/>in <date when="1795">1795</date>; when a part of
                    the territory was ceded<br/>to the United States, together with some
                    posts,<br/>or trading stations, within the Indian part. Of<br/>these <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> is one. It is in the unceded<br/>parts
                    that the experiments have been made,<br/>which are recorded in the following
                    pages.</p>
<p>Both the Yearly Meetings seem to have lost<br/>no time in beginning their work of
                    brotherly<br/>kindness to the Indians. The war had been<br/>an obstruction; but
                    we find the date of the<br/>peace, and of the appointment of their
                    com-<br/>mittens, to be in the same year, <date when="1795">1795</date>.</p>
<p>In the letter which forms the Appendix to<br/>the Pennsylvanian account, an
                    Indian chief, named<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, is
                    spoken of in terms of great ap-<br/>probation. It may therefore be particularly
                    ac-<br/>ceptable to see a speech of his in this narrative.</p>
<p>In the advertisement prefixed to the Penn-<br/>sylvanian account, an apology is
                    made for the<br/>apparent absence of religious instruction as a<br/>part of the
                    plan. The concluding paragraph<br/>of this account confirms the apology; but
                    fu-<br/>pressed the necessity of repeating it.</p>
<p>Probably, a slight geographical description,<br/>may render the narrative more
                    interesting to<br/>some readers; and though maps are not always<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_005" n="5"></pb>
                    /&gt;to be depended on, especially with respect to a<br/>country so uncivilized,
                    the following sketch,<br/>taken from maps, may convey no bad notion of<br/>the
                    locality of the committee’s labours.</p>
<p><geogname key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogname> runs from N. to S. and
                    falls<br/>into the Ohio in about 81.40 West longitude.</p>
<p><geogname key="tuscr">Tuskarawas</geogname> (supposing it to be the
                    Tuscaroras<br/>of the maps), is a small stream in the limits
                    of<br/>Pennsylvania, which falls into the <geogname key="junia">Junietta</geogname>, a<br/>branch of the <geogname key="susqu">Susquehannah</geogname>.</p>
<p><a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a> is an Indian settlement, on a
                        <geogname key="sandr">river</geogname><br/>of the same name that has a N.E.
                    course, and<br/>empties itself into a small arm of <geogname key="lakee">lake
                        Erie</geogname>, near<br/>its western end, about 82.50 W. lon.</p>
<p><geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname> is the name of three rivers in
                    this<br/>country. That which concerns the account is<br/><geogname key="miamr">Miami</geogname> of the lakes, which running nearly from S.<br/>to N. a
                    course of apparently 150 miles, falls into<br/><geogname key="lakee">lake
                        Erie</geogname>, about 50 miles W. of <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>.<br/>On this river, where, as the term is, it
                    forks,<br/>is <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>The <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname> seems a long and crooked
                    river.<br/>One of its sources is S. of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>; the<br/>stream from which is doubtless the Wabash,
                    near<br/>which the agricultural examples have been felt,<br/>as related in the
                    account. The Ohio receives<br/>the waters the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, not far from the 88th<br/>degree of W. longitude.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_006" n="6"></pb>
<p>The <geogname key="eelr">Eel-River</geogname> appears to be one of the
                    streams<br/>which run into the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>. It seems
                    to rise<br/>in the neighbourhood of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> nation, is no doubt connected
                    with<br/>the <geogname key="miamr">river</geogname>, or rivers of that name. The
                    place of<br/>the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> is given in the
                    account. The <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Sha-wanees<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> are marked in one map<br/>as occupying
                    the neighborhood of the Ohio.<br/>The <a href="/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> are
                    mentioned in the account as con-<br/>nested with <geogname key="eelr">Eel-River</geogname>.</p>
<p><a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> in a strait line seems not less
                    than <br/>350 miles from <a href="/places/balti1">Baltimore<placename key="balti1"></placename></a>; but
                    probably a great<br/>deal more by any practicable road.</p>
<p>Humanity may venture to rejoice at these at-<br/>tempts. Though, as was observed
                    in the former<br/>account, not on a grand scale, they are attended<br/>with
                    considerable expence; and a labour, not<br/>easily appreciated by the
                    inhabitants of highly<br/>cultivated and civilized countries. But, to
                    adopt<br/>a metaphor from the work, they are attempts<br/>to cultivate the
                    large, and inexhaustible field<br/>of Christian benevolence: for no less is
                    every<br/>extension of brotherly kindness to our fellow-<br/>men, which springs
                    from Christian principles.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_007" n="7"></pb>
<p>THE Editor regrets that, in the letter<br/>from the American General, printed at
                    the close<br/>of the Account from <a href="/places/penns">Pennsylvania<placename key="penns"></placename></a>, a few lines<br/>were suffered to remain, which
                    convey a cen-<br/>sure on some former American missionaries. It<br/>may have not
                    been perfectly easy for a person in<br/>a very different walk of life to feel
                    exactly the<br/>difficulties of their situation. Whoever duly<br/>weighs the
                    state of the Indians, may account for<br/>their want of success without thinking
                    them<br/>much to blame. At any rate the Editor is dis-<br/>posed to call it an
                    oversight, that in a work<br/>intended to show the successful diligence of
                    one<br/>set of men, there should have slipped in a need-<br/>less censure of
                    another.</p>

<p>Extract from the Minutes of the <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly Meetingheld in

<p>A Report from our <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee on
                        Indianconcerns<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> was produced, which being read
                    and<br/>considered, much satisfaction with their pro-<br/>ceding was expressed:
                    inasmuch as it very<br/>evidently appears that considerable benefits to<br/>our
                    Red Brethren have already resulted, since<br/>the care of the <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> towards them.<br/>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">Committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> were encouraged to continue<br/>such exertions, in the
                    prosecution of this im-<br/>portent concern, as may be in their power
                    to<br/>extend: they were also left at liberty to have<br/>printed, for the more
                    general information of<br/>Friends, as many copies of their report,
                    con-<br/>nected with a narrative of their previous pro-<br/>ceedings, as they
                    apprehend may be usefully<br/>distributed amongst our members.</p>

                A BRIEF ACCOUNT<br/>OF THE<br/>PROCEEDINGS OF THE <a href="/organizations/bymindian">COMMITTEE<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a><br/>APPOINTED BY THE<br/><a href="/organizations/bym">YEARLY
                        MEEITNG OF FRIENDSHELD IN BALTIMORE<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,<br/>For Promoting the
                    Improvement and Civilization<br/>of Indian Natives.
                <p>A weighty concern having been opened in<br/>the year <date when="1795">1795</date> in our <a href="/organizations/bym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>,
                    re-<br/>specting the difficulties and distresses to which<br/>the Indian natives
                    of this land were subject, it<br/>obtained the serious attention of Friends;
                    and<br/>many observations were made, relative to the<br/>kindness of their
                    ancestors to ours in the early<br/>settlement of this country; exciting a deep
                    con-<br/>sideration and enquiry, whether, under the in-<br/>fluence of that
                    exalted benevolence and good<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_010" n="10"></pb>will to men, which our holy
                    profession incul-<br/>cates, there was not something for us, as a<br/>Society,
                    to do for them; towards their promoting their<br/>religious instruction, and
                    knowledge of agricul-<br/>ture, and useful mechanic arts.</p>
<p>A solemnity prevailing, the sentiments of<br/>many were expressed, evidencing a
                    near sym-<br/>pathy with them. The meeting therefore united<br/>in recommending
                    to our Quarterly and Monthly<br/>Meetings, to open subscriptions amongst
                    our<br/>members for their relief; and appointed a <a href="/organizations/bymindian">com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, to pay such attention to the
                    interesting<br/>concern, as they might be enabled to render.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, after having fully
                    considered<br/>the subject of their appointment, concluded, as<br/>the most
                    effectual way of obtaining correct in-<br/>formation of the situation and
                    disposition of the<br/>Indians, to appoint a deputation from
                    amongst<br/>themselves, to visit the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawnees<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>,
                        <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>,<br/><a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, or other such nations, north-west of<br/>the <geogname key="ohior">river Ohio</geogname>, as they might find practicable.<br/>The
                    friends who were nominated to this service,<br/>having first obtained the
                    approbation of Govern-<br/>ment, proceeded in the summer of <date when="1796">1796</date>, as far<br/>as the forks of the <geogname key="muski">Muskingum
                        river</geogname>, at which<br/>place, they had been informed that a
                    consider-<br/>able number of Indians were collected; but<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_011" n="11"></pb>upon
                    their arrival there, they found that all the<br/>chiefs, and most of the
                    hunters, had dispersed.<br/>And, it not appearing practicable to
                    convene<br/>them in a suitable manner for a conference at<br/>that time, they
                    returned without accomplishing<br/>the object of their visit. They however
                    saw<br/>divers hunters and others, who appeared to be<br/>well disposed to
                    receive the instruction and<br/>assistance, with which Friends proposed to
                    fur-<br/>nish them.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> being still deficient in
                    the<br/>information necessary to enable them to pro-<br/>ceed with safety, in so
                    important an undertaking,<br/>one of their number offered, in the fall of
                    this<br/>year, to undertake a visit to the Indians, for the<br/>purpose of
                    obtaining a more satisfactory know-<br/>ledge respecting them; and his proposal
                    being<br/>approved, he was encouraged to proceed as<br/>soon as might be
                    practicable. Accordingly, in<br/>the spring of <date when="1797">1797</date>,
                    he, with two others of the<br/>committee, who became concerned to unite<br/>with
                    him, made them a visit; in the course of<br/>which, having passed by a number of
                    their<br/>hunting camps, and several of their towns, they<br/>had large
                    opportunity of discovering their situ-<br/>ation. Often exposed to the
                    inclemency of the<br/>seasons, with a very precarious, and often a<br/>very
                    scanty supply of food and clothing, they<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_012" n="12"></pb>suffered all the
                    miseries of extreme poverty; in a<br/>country, which, from its great fertility,
                    would,<br/>with but little cultivation, abundantly supply<br/>them with all the
                    necessaries of life.</p>
<p>These friends had an opportunity with some<br/>of they chiefs and hunters of the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, and<br/><a href="/organizations/delaware">Delaware<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> nations, in which they informed them<br/>of the concern
                    of Friends relative to them; and<br/>endeavoured to impress on their minds, the
                    ad-<br/>vantages they would derive, from permitting a<br/>knowledge of
                    agriculture, and some of the most<br/>useful mechanic arts, to be introduced
                    amongst<br/>their people. The Indians appeared to give close<br/>attention to
                    the communication, and promised<br/>to lay the matter before their grand
                    council, and<br/>inform us of their conclusion upon the subject.</p>
<p>No way opened during the year <date when="1798">1798</date>, to<br/>proceed in
                    carrying the concern of the <a href="/organizations/bym">YearlyMeeting<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a> into
                    effect; except that the committee<br/>furnished a few implements of husbandry,
                    and<br/>other assistance to some Indian families, which<br/>were situated upon
                    the branches of the <geogname key="tuscr">Tus-<br/>karawas</geogname> river.</p>
<p>In the <date when="1799-02">Second Month, 1799</date>, the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a><br/>received a speech, and a belt of the

<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1798-09"></date></dateline>
<p>Brethren Quakers,<br/>You remember that we once met a cer-<br/>tain
                            place. When we had there met, a great<br/>many good things were said,
                            and much friend-<br/>ship was professed between us.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You told us that at the time, that you not only<br/>took us
                            by the hand, but that you held us fast<br/>by the arm: that you then
                            formed a chain of<br/>friendship. You said, that it was not a chain
                            of<br/>iron; but that it was a chain of precious metal,<br/>a chain of
                            silver, that would never get rusty; and<br/>that this chain, would bind
                            us in brotherly affec-<br/>tion for ever.</p>
<p>Brethren, listen:<br/>We have often heard that you were a good<br/>and a
                            faithful people, ever ready to do justice,<br/>and good to all men,
                            without distinction of co-<br/>lour; therefore we love you the more
                            sincerely,<br/>because of the goodness of your hearts, which<br/>has
                            been talked of amongst our nations, long<br/>since.</p>
<p>Brethren, listen:<br/>You have informed us, that you intend to<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_014" n="14"></pb>
                            visit us; yes, that, even in our tents and cabins,<br/>you
                            will take us by the hand. You, brethren,<br/>cannot admit a doubt that
                            we should be very<br/>happy to see you.</p>
<p>Brethren, listen:<br/>It is but proper to inform you at this
                            time,<br/>that when you do come forward to see us, you<br/>will, no
                            doubt, pass by my place of residence<br/>at <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>. I will then take you, not only<br/>by the
                            hand, but by the arm, and will conduct<br/>you safely to the grand
                            council-fire of our great<br/>Sasteretsey; where all good things are
                            trans-<br/>acted, and where nothing bad is permitted to<br/>appear. When
                            in the grand council of our<br/>Sasteretsey, we will then sit down
                            together, in<br/>peace and friendship, as brethren are accus-<br/>tomed
                            to do, after a long absence; and remind<br/>each other, and talk of
                            those things that were<br/>done between our Good Grand-Fathers,
                            when<br/>they first met upon our lands, upon this great<br/>island.</p>
<p>Brethren,<br/>May the Great Spirit, the master of light<br/>and life, so
                            dispose the hearts and minds of all<br/>our nations and people, that the
                            calamities of<br/>war may never more be felt, or known by any<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_015" n="15"></pb>
                               of them; that our roads and paths may never<br/>more be
                            stained with the blood of our young<br/>warriors; and that our helpless
                            women and chil-<br/>dren may live in peace and happiness.</p>

<p>After a consideration of the foregoing com-<br/>munication, from the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandot<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a> Nation of Indians,<br/>the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> concluded to appoint a few<br/>friends
                    to make them a visit, agreeably to their<br/>request. These were directed to
                    cultivate a<br/>friendly correspondence with them, and afford<br/>them such
                    assistance as they might be enabled<br/>to render. They accordingly proceeded in
                    the<br/>visit; with an intention of being at the General<br/>Council; and after
                    passing through several of<br/>their towns, arrived on the <date when="1799-06-03">Third of the Sixth<br/>Month</date> at <a href="/places/usand">Upper Sandusky<placename key="usand"></placename></a>, the principal vil-<br/>lage of the
                        <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, where they were received<br/>in a
                    friendly manner, by <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie (the Crane)<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a>,<br/>and
                    others of that nation.</p>
<p> Upon conferring with these Indians, it was<br/>found, that a mistake had been
                    made in the<br/>translation of the speech, which they had sent<br/>to friends,
                    respecting the time of opening their<br/>great Council, to which Friends had
                    been invited:<br/>who were now informed, that it began annually<br/>at the full
                    moon, in the Sixth Month. Finding<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_016" n="16"></pb>it would be difficult to
                    procure food for them-<br/>selves and horses there, until that time, the
                        <a href="/organizations/bymindian">com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> concluded it was best,
                    under their present<br/>circumstances, to propose to <a href="/people/tarh1">Tarhie<persname key="tarh1"></persname></a>, a con-<br/>terence with him and the other chiefs,
                    who<br/>were then at, and in the neighborhood of, <a href="/places/sand">San-dusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>: which was accordingly agreed to; and<br/>at the
                    time appointed, they met him and several<br/>other chiefs, together with a
                    number of their<br/>hunters, at his own house; when they had a<br/>full
                    opportunity with them on the subject of<br/>their visit.</p>
<p>Their communication appeared to be received<br/>with great satisfaction by the
                    Indians; who<br/>in their answer, delivered on some strings of<br/>Wampum,
                    expressed the gratitude they felt, for<br/>the care and friendship which their
                    beloved<br/>brethren, the Quakers, had always manifested<br/>for the Indians;
                    and promised, as soon as the<br/>grand Council met, that they would
                    communi-<br/>cate fully to it, the concern which our Society<br/>felt for their
                    improvement, and inform us by a<br/>written speech of their conclusion
                    thereon.</p>
<p>Whilst these friends were at <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>
                    and<br/>other villages, their minds were often deeply<br/>affected, under the
                    sorrowful consideration of<br/>the baneful effects of spirituous liquor
                    upon<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_017" n="17"></pb>the Indians, at that time supplied with it, in
                    al-<br/><br/>most every village, by Canadian traders residing<br/>amongst them:
                    and they were confirmed in the<br/>opinion, that unless these traders could be
                    res-<br/>trained from furnishing them with this destruc-<br/>tive article, in
                    exchange for their skins and furs,<br/>they would not easily be persuade to turn
                    their<br/>minds towards agriculture and the useful arts.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding which discouragement, the<br/>great affection they have for our
                    Society, mani-<br/>fested on all occasions whilst the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> were<br/> amongst them, induced a hope, that
                    Friends<br/> would endeavour to keep under the weight of<br/>the concern; and be
                    prepared to proceed in the<br/>benevolent work, whenever way might open
                    for<br/>further service amongst them.</p>
<p>There was not any communication between<br/>the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> and the Indians during the year<br/><date when="1800">1800</date>. In the spring of <date when="1801">1801</date>, they addressed
                    a<br/>letter to them, which was forwarded to <a href="/places/sand">San-dusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>; but the person to whose care it
                    was<br/>directed, and who was requested to communi-<br/>cate it to their council
                    in the Sixth Month, not<br/>being at home, it was returned to the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>.</p>
<p>In the <date when="1802-06">Sixth Month, 1802</date>, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>,<br/><a href="/people/fmeda1">Five

                        <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowattomi<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a> nations of Indians,<br/>passed through <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a>, on their way to visit<br/>the President
                    of the United States; at which<br/>time the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> took the opportunity of<br/>holding a conference with
                    them; in which the<br/>concern of Friends was fully opened; when<br/>they
                    informed them, of the great discouragement<br/>Friends had met with, in carrying
                    their views<br/>into effect, from the intemperate and destructive<br/>use of
                    spirituous liquors amongst the Indians:<br/>which was found to be the greatest
                    obstacle in<br/>the way of their profiting by the aid which<br/>Friends had been
                    desirous of giving them.</p>
<p>This opened the way for free communica-<br/>tion, on the subject of the
                    introduction of ardent<br/>spirits into their country; in which its
                    baneful<br/>and pernicious effects were strongly pointed out.<br/>The <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, in reply, made a very
                    pathe-<br/>ticand impressive speech upon this subject, from<br/>which the
                    following in extracted.</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1802-06"></date></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>When our forefathers first met on
                            this<br/>island, your Red Brethren were very numerous.<br/>But since the
                            introduction amongst us, of what<br/>you call spirituous liquors, and
                            what we think<br/>may justly be called Poison, our numbers
                            are<br/>greatly diminished. It has destroyed a great<br/>part of your
                            Red Brethren.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_019" n="19"></pb>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>We plainly perceive, that you see the
                            very<br/>evil which destroys your Red Brethren. It is<br/>not an evil of
                            our own making. We have not<br/>placed it amongst ourselves. It is an
                            evil placed<br/>amongst us by the white people. We look to<br/>them to
                            remove it out of our country. We tell<br/>them, Brethren, fetch us
                            useful things; bring<br/>goods that will clothe us, our women, and
                            our<br/>children; and not this evil liquor, that destroys<br/>our
                            reason, that destroys our health, that de-<br/>stroys our lives. But all
                            we can say on this<br/>subject, is of no service, nor gives relief to
                            your<br/>Red Brethren.</p>
<p>My Brothers and Friends,<br/>I rejoice to find, that you agree in
                            opinion<br/>with us, and express an anxiety to be, if pos-<br/>sible, of
                            service to us, in removing this great<br/>evil out of our country: an
                            evil which has had<br/>so much room in it, and has destroyed so
                            many<br/>of our lives, that it causes our young men to<br/>say, <said>We
                                had better be at war with the white<br/>people. This liquor, which
                                they introduce into<br/>our country, is more to be feared than the
                                gun<br/>and the tomahawk. There are more of us dead<br/>since the
                                treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, than we
                                lost by<br/>the six years of war before. It is all owing to
                                the<br/>introduction of this liquor amongst us.</said></p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_020" n="20"></pb>
<p>Brothers,<br/>When our young men have been out hunt-<br/>ing, and are
                            returning home loaded with skins<br/>and furs; on their way, if it
                            happens that they<br/>come where some of this whiskey is
                            deposited,<br/>the white man who sells it, tells them to take
                            a<br/>little drink. Some of them will say No, I do<br/>not want it. They
                            go on till they come to ano-<br/>ther house, where they find more of the
                            same<br/>kind of drink. It is there offered again; they<br/>refuse; and
                            again the third time; but finally,<br/>the fourth or fifth time, one
                            accepts of it, and<br/>takes a drink; and getting one, he wants
                            ano-<br/>ther; and then a third, and fourth, till his senses<br/>have
                            left him. After his reason comes back<br/>again to him; when he gets up,
                            and finds where<br/>he is, he asks for his peltry. The answer
                                is,<br/><said>You have drunk them.</said>
<said>Where is my gun?</said><br/><said>It is gone.</said>
<said>Where is my blanket?</said>
<said>It is<br/>gone.</said>
<said>Where is my shirt?</said>
<said>You have sold<br/>it for whiskey!!</said> Now, Brothers, figure to
                            your-<br/>selves what condition this man must be in. He<br/>has a family
                            at home; a wife and children, who<br/>stand in need of the profits of
                            his hunting. What<br/>must be their wants, when he himself is
                            even<br/>without a shirt!</p>

<p>These chiefs appeared to be much rejoiced at<br/>the assistance, Friends proposed
                    to render them;<br/>and, in reply to that part of our
                    communication,<br/>observed, <said>That it was their anxious wish, to<br/>engage
                        in the culture of their lands; for although<br/>the game was not so scarce,
                        but that they could<br/>get enough to eat; yet they were sensible it
                        was<br/>daily diminishing, and that the time was not far<br/>distant, when
                        they should be compelled to take<br/>hold of such tools, as they saw in the
                        hands<br/>of the white people.</said></p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, on a weighty consideration
                    of<br/>the subject, being from their former experience<br/>united in judgment,
                    that no great progress could<br/>be made in the civilization of the Indians,
                    while<br/>they were so abundantly supplied with distilled<br/>spirits, concluded
                    to address Congress on the<br/>subject. Their memorial was favourably
                    re-<br/>ceived, and a law passed, which in some mea-<br/>sure provided a remedy
                    for the evil.</p>
<p>As it now appeared to the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, that
                    the<br/>principal obstruction to the introduction of agri-<br/>culture amongst
                    the Indians was removed, they<br/>felt themselves encouraged to proceed in
                    their<br/>undertaking; and accordingly provided a con-<br/>siderable number of
                    implements of husbandry;<br/>such as ploughs, hoes, axes &amp;c. which were
                    for-<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_022" n="22"></pb>warded to <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, where they were imme-<br/>diately distributed, as a
                    present from the society<br/>of Friends, and thankfully received by
                    the<br/>Indians.</p>
<p>A letter was received in the summer of <date when="1803">1803</date>,<br/>from
                    the agent for Indian affairs at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>,<br/>in which he says:—</p>
<p><said>Since there have been no spirituous liquors<br/>in the Indian country, they
                        appear very indus-<br/>trious, and are fond of raising stock.</said> He
                    also<br/>expressed, as his opinion, that <said>the suppression<br/>of spirituous
                        liquors in that country is the most<br/>beneficial thing which has ever been
                        done for<br/>them by the United States; that there had not<br/>been one
                        Indian killed in that neighbourhood for<br/>a year; and that in no preceding
                        year, since the<br/>treaty of <a href="/places/greenv">Greenville<placename key="greenv"></placename></a>, had there been less than<br/>ten, and in some
                        years, as many as thirty, killed.</said><br/>The agent further added, that
                        <said>the Indians<br/>appeared to be very desirous of procuring
                        for<br/>themselves the necessaries of life, in our way;<br/>but say they do
                        not know how to begin. Some<br/>of their old men say, <q>The white people
                            want<br/>for nothing. We wish them to shew us how<br/>to provide the
                            many good things we see amongst<br/>them. If it is their wish to
                            instruct us in their<br/>way of living, as they tell us it is, we
                            wish<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_023" n="23"></pb>them to make haste and do it, for we are
                            old,<br/>and must die soon; but we wish to see our<br/>women and
                            children in that path, that will lead<br/>them to happiness, before we
                            die.</q></said></p>
<p>At the same time a letter was received from<br/>the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, in
                    which<br/>they expressed a wish, that some of the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">com-mittee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> would visit their country; which
                    being<br/>considered, the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> appointed
                    a depu-<br/>tation for that purpose; who were authorized<br/>to take one or more
                    suitable persons with them,<br/>to reside amongst the Indians, for the
                    purpose<br/>of teaching them agriculture, and other useful<br/>knowledge; as far
                    as such an establishment<br/>should appear practicable.</p>
<p>In the <date when="1804-02">Second Month, 1804</date>, two of the<br/>deputation
                    proceeded to <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, accom-<br/>panied by
                        <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>; who had offered
                    his<br/>services to go with them, to remain with the<br/>Indians during the
                    summer; for the purpose of<br/>instructing them in husbandry; taking with
                    him<br/>two horses to be employed in ploughing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>They arrived at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a> the <date when="1804-03-31">last day<br/>of the Third Month</date>, and soon after
                    convened<br/>several of the principal chiefs; in a council with<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_024" n="24"></pb>whom, a future day was fixed upon for the<br/><a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> to meet them, together with as many<br/>of their old
                    men, their young men, and their<br/>women and children, as could be assembled.
                    The<br/>attendance of the latter was particularly re-<br/>quested by our
                    deputation; and these chiefs<br/>having previously requested, that whatever
                    mat-<br/>ter Friends might have to communicate to the<br/>Indians should be
                    written, in order that they<br/>might lay it before the Grand Council,
                    in<br/>the <date when="1804-06">Sixth Month</date> following (to the
                    attendance<br/>of which they very pressingly invited the com-<br/>mittee), on
                    the day appointed, the committee<br/>being met by a considerable number of the
                    na-<br/>tives, the following written address was read<br/>and interpreted to
                    them.</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">
<dateline><date when="1804-06"></date></dateline>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>When we were together, eight days ago,<br/>with
                            the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> and the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, the<br/>letter was read to them
                            which has just been<br/>read. That letter, you observe, says, that
                            we<br/>were appointed by the people called <a href="/organizations/bym">Quakersof Baltimore<orgname key="bym"></orgname></a>, to visit you, and to take you
                            by<br/>the hand on their behalf, desiring that you<br/>would receive any
                            communications from us, as<br/>coming immediately from them.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_025" n="25"></pb>
<p>Brothers,<br/>After that letter was read, our hearts were<br/>filled with
                            so much love for our Red Brethren,<br/>that, on looking over and
                            considering the busi-<br/>ness upon which we had come, we felt a
                            desire<br/>to see as many of you together as could be<br/>convened: and
                            this day was then agreed upon,<br/>for us to meet you.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We believed, that the things we had to<br/>say, were of
                            great importance to our Red Bre-<br/>thren; and therefore it was that we
                            requested to<br/>see you together; that you all might have
                            an<br/>opportunity of hearing what we have to say.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>Our hearts are filled with thankfulness to<br/>the Great
                            Spirit, that he has brought us safely<br/>to the country of our Red
                            Brethren, and pro-<br/>tected us through our journey. We also
                            rejoice<br/>that he has given us this opportunity of seeing<br/>you, and
                            of taking you by the hand.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>It is now a little more than two years since<br/>your
                            brothers of <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a> had an
                            opportunity<br/>of becoming acquainted with the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, the<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/topin1">Tuthinipee<persname key="topin1"></persname></a>, and
                            some other chiefs.<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_026" n="26"></pb>They were glad of that opportunity of
                            having a<br/>talking with them, and of enquiring after the<br/>situation
                            of their Red Brethren.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We had for some time entertained appre-<br/>hensions, that
                            the many changes, which were<br/>taking place in circumstances, must
                            greatly<br/>change the situation of our Red Brethren; and<br/>that the
                            time was fast approaching, in which it<br/>would be necessary for them
                            to alter their mode<br/>of living.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>After our talk with the chiefs whom we<br/>have just
                            mentioned, we are fully convinced<br/>that the time was come, in which
                            our Red Bre-<br/>thren ought to begin to cultivate their lands.<br/>That
                            they ought to raise corn, and other grain,<br/>also horses, cows, sheep,
                            hogs, and other ani-<br/>mal. We then proposed to afford them
                            some<br/>assistance. They appeared to be glad of the<br/>proposal, and
                            informed us that many of their<br/>people were disposed to turn their
                            attention to<br/>the cultivation of the earth. They also ex-<br/>pressed
                            a desire to be assisted by their brothers<br/>of <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a>.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_027" n="27"></pb>
<p>Brothers,<br/>Having been encouraged by the opportu-<br/>nity which we
                            then had, we sent to the care of<br/>the agent for Indian affairs, some
                            ploughs, har-<br/>ness for horses, axes, hoes, and other
                            imple-<br/>ments of husbandry, which were made for the<br/>use of our
                            Red Brethren; and desired that they<br/>might be distributed amongst
                            them, as tokens<br/>of our friendship.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We received last fall, through the hands<br/>of the agent
                            for Indian affairs, a talk from the<br/><a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                                Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a>, the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                            Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, and others, in-<br/>forming us that they had received
                            the imple-<br/>ments of husbandry; and requesting that
                            their<br/>brothers of <a href="/places/balt1">Baltimore<placename key="balt1"></placename></a> would
                            send some of their<br/>people into the country of their Red
                            Brethren;<br/>for the purpose of seeing their situation, and<br/>shewing
                            them how to make use of the tools:<br/>saying, they did not know how to
                            begin.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>It is for these purposes, that we have now<br/>come; and we
                            again repeat, that we rejoice we<br/>have this opportunity of seeing
                            you, and of<br/>taking you by the hand.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_028" n="28"></pb>
<p>Brothers,<br/>In coming into the country of our Red<br/>Brethren, we have
                            come with our eyes open.<br/>And although we are affected with sorrow,
                            in<br/>believing, that many of the red people suffer<br/>much, for the
                            want of food, and for the want<br/>of clothing; yet our hearts have been
                            made<br/>glad, in seeing, that it has pleased the Great<br/>Spirit, to
                            give you a rich and valuable country.<br/>Because we know, that it is
                            out of the earth, that<br/>food and clothing come. We are sure,
                            bro-<br/>thers, that, with but little labour and attention,<br/>you may
                            raise much more corn, and other grain,<br/>than will be necessary for
                            yourselves, your wo-<br/>men, and children; and may also, with
                            great<br/>ease, raise many more horses, cows, sheep,<br/>hogs, and other
                            valuable animals, than will be<br/>necessary for your own use. We are
                            also con-<br/>fident, that if you will pursue our method, in<br/>the
                            cultivation of your land, you will live in<br/>much greater ease and
                            plenty, and with much<br/>less fatigue and toil, than attend hunting for
                            a<br/>subsistence.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We are fully convinced, that if you will<br/>adopt our mode
                            of cultivating the earth, and of<br/>raising useful animals, you will
                            find it to be a<br/>mode of living not only far more plentiful
                            and<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_029" n="29"></pb>much less fatiguing; but also much more
                            cer-<br/>tain, and which will expose your bodies less, to<br/>the
                            inclemencies of the weather, than hunting.<br/>It will lead you,
                            brothers, to have fixed homes.<br/>You will build comfortable
                            dwelling-houses for<br/>yourselves, you women, and children,
                            where<br/>you may be sheltered from the rain, from the<br/>frost, and
                            from the snow; and where you may<br/>enjoy in plenty the rewards of your
                            labours.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>In laying these things before you, we have<br/>no other
                            motive, than a desire of heart for the<br/>improvement, the benefit, and
                            the welfare of<br/>our Red Brethren; and therefore it is, that
                            we<br/>speak with freedom; and we hope that what we<br/>have to say,
                            will go in at one ear, and not come<br/>out at the other; but that it
                            will be remembered<br/>by our Red Brethren. For we know,
                            brothers,<br/>that we shall not be ashamed of what we say,<br/>when in
                            time to come, you compare the things<br/>we are saying to you, with your
                            experience in<br/>practising them.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We will here mention, that the time was,<br/>when the
                            forefathers of your brothers, the white<br/>people, lived beyond the
                            great water, in the<br/>same manner that our Red Brethren now
                            live.<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_030" n="30"></pb>The winters can yet be counted, when they
                            went<br/>almost naked, when they procured their living<br/>by fishing,
                            and by the bow and arrow in hunt-<br/>ing; and when they lived in houses
                            no better<br/>than yours. They were encouraged by some,<br/>who came
                            from towards the sun-rising, and<br/>lived amongst them, to change their
                            mode<br/>of living. They did change; they cultivated the<br/>earth; and
                            we are sure the change was a happy<br/>one.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We are not ashamed to acknowledge, that<br/>the
                            time was, when our forefathers rejoiced at<br/>finding a wild plum-tree,
                            or at killing a little<br/>game, and that they wandered up and
                            down,<br/>living on the uncertain supplies of fishing and<br/>hunting.
                            But, brothers, for your encourage-<br/>ment, we now mention, that by
                            turning their<br/>attention to the cultivation of the earth,
                            instead<br/>of the plum-tree, they soon had orchards, of<br/>many kinds
                            of good fruit; instead of the wild<br/>game, they soon had large numbers
                            of cattle,<br/>horses, sheep, hogs, and other valuable ani-<br/>mal; an
                            in many places, instead of their fo-<br/>rests, they had large fields of
                            corn and of other<br/>grain, as also of many other valuable
                            produc-<br/>tions of the earth.</p>
<pb facs="SW_BYM1806_031" n="31"></pb>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We hope your eyes will be open, to see<br/>clearly the
                            things which are best for you; and<br/>that you will desire to pursue
                            them. We be-<br/>lieve, brothers, that it is in the heart of
                            your<br/>father, the President of the United States, to<br/>assist his
                            Red children, in the cultivation of the<br/>earth; and to render them
                            services, which will<br/>be greatly for their benefit and welfare.
                            We<br/>hope that your exertions to change your present<br/>mode of
                            living, will be so plain to him, that he<br/>will see them. This will
                            encourage him to con-<br/>tinue to aid you, in your endeavours.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We have spoken plainly; we desire to<br/>speak plain. We
                            will now tell you, that we<br/>have not come merely to talk with you.
                            We<br/>have come prepared to render you a little assist-<br/>ance. Our
                            believed brother, <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>,
                            <br/>who is now present, has come along with us.<br/>His desire to
                            cultivate for you, a field of corn;<br/>also to show you how to raise
                            some of the other<br/>productions of the earth. He knows how to<br/>use
                            the plough, the hoe, the axe, and other<br/>implements of husbandry.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We will here ask you, Are you still desi-<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_032" n="32"></pb>rous to be instructed by us, in the cultivation of<br/>your lands? If
                            you say, you are; our brother,<br/>whom we have just mentioned, will
                            continue<br/>with you, during the summer. We shall leave<br/>it to you,
                            to shew him the spot where to begin<br/>to work.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>He has left a farm; he has left a wife, and<br/>five small
                            children, who are very dear to him;<br/>he has come from a sincere
                            desire to be useful<br/>to our Red Brethren. His motives are pure;
                            he<br/>will ask no reward from you, for his services;<br/>his greatest
                            reward will be, in the satisfaction he<br/>will feel, in finding you
                            inclined to take hold of<br/>the same tools which he takes hold of; to
                            re-<br/>chive from him instruction in the cultivation of<br/>your lands,
                            and to pursue the example he will<br/>set you.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We hope, you will make the situation of<br/>our brother as
                            comfortable as circumstances<br/>will admit. We hope, also, that many of
                            your<br/>young men will be willing to be taught by him,<br/>to use the
                            plough, the hoe, and other imple-<br/>mets of husbandry. For we are
                            sure, brothers,<br/>that as you take hold of such tools, as are
                            in<br/>the hands of the white people, you will find<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_033" n="33"></pb>them
                            to be to you, like having additional hands.<br/>You will also find, that
                            by using them, they<br/>will enable you to do many things, which,
                            with-<br/>out them, cannot be performed.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>There is one thing more, which we wish to<br/>add. The
                            white people, in order to get their<br/>land cultivated, find it
                            necessary, that their<br/>young men should be employed in it, and
                            not<br/>their women. Women are less than men. They<br/>are not as strong
                            as men. They are not as<br/>able to endure fatigue and toil as men. It
                            is<br/>the business of our women, to be employed in<br/>our houses, to
                            keep them clean, to sew, knit,<br/>spin, and weave; to dress food for
                            themselves<br/>and families; to make clothes for the men and<br/>the
                            rest of their families, to keep the clothing<br/>of their families
                            clean, and to take care of their<br/>children.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>We desire not to mention too many things<br/>to you; but we
                            must add a little further. We<br/>are fully convinced, that if you will
                            turn your<br/>attention to the cultivation of the earth, to<br/>raising
                            the different kinds of grain, to erecting<br/>mills for grinding grain,
                            to building comfortable<br/>dwelling-houses for your families, to
                            raising<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_034" n="34"></pb>useful animals; amongst others, sheep, for
                            the<br/>advantage of the wool, in making clothing; and to<br/>raising
                            flax and hemp, for your linen; and if<br/>your young women learn to
                            spin, and weave;<br/>that your lives will be much easier, and
                            hap-<br/>pier, than at present; and that your numbers<br/>will increase,
                            and not continue to diminish. As<br/>we before observed, brothers, your
                            land is<br/>good. It is far better than the land, the white<br/>people
                            near the great water cultivate. We are<br/>persuaded, that your land
                            will produce double<br/>the quantity of any kind of grain, or of flax,
                            or<br/>hemp, with the same labour necessary near<br/>the great
                            water.</p>
<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We shall now end what we have to say,
                            with<br/>informing you, that all the corn, and other pro-<br/>ductions
                            of the earth, which <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                            Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>,<br/>may raise, we wish our Red Brethren to
                            accept<br/>of, as a token of our friendship. And it is our<br/>desire
                            that the chiefs of the <a href="/organizations/potaw">Pottowattomi<orgname key="potaw"></orgname></a>
                                and<br/><a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> nations, who are now
                            present, added to<br/>our brothers, the <a href="/people/fmeda1">Five
                                Medals<persname key="fmeda1"></persname></a>, <a href="/people/topin1">Tuthinipee<persname key="topin1"></persname></a>,<br/>and <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip
                                Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, make such a distribution<br/>thereof, as they may
                            think proper.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>The Indians observed great decorum, and<br/>gave close attention during the
                    delivery of this<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_035" n="35"></pb>address. They respectfully manifested their
                    ap-<br/>probation of the sentiments it contained, by re-<br/>iterated
                    exclamations of applause, and the most<br/>evident demonstrations of
                    satisfaction. In re-<br/>ply, the <a href="/people/lturt1">Little
                        Turtle<persname key="lturt1"></persname></a> delivered a speech on be-<br/>half of the council, from
                    which the following<br/>is extracted.</p>
<floatingtext type="speech">

<p>Brothers and Friends,<br/>We rejoice, that the Great Spirit has
                            ap-<br/>pointed that we should meet this day; for we<br/>believe, this
                            meeting will be of the utmost con-<br/>sequence to your Red
                            Brethren.</p>
<p>Brothres,<br/>The things you have said to us, require our<br/>greatest
                            attention: it is really necessary, that we<br/> should deliberate upon
                            them. In order to do<br/> so, we must beg you to leave the paper,
                            upon<br/>which they are written, that we may communi- <br/>cate them to
                            our chiefs, when they assemble in<br/>Grand Council.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>You have been very particular in pointing<br/>out to us,
                            the duties of our women; and you<br/>have told us, that in adoptting
                            your mode of<br/>living, our numbers would increase, and not<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_036" n="36"></pb>continue to diminish. In all this, I certainly<br/>agree
                            with you, and I hope my brother chiefs<br/>will also agree with you.</p>
<p>Brothers,<br/>Assure your people who sent you here,<br/>tell your old
                            chiefs, that we are obliged to<br/>them, for their friendly offers to
                            assist us, in<br/>changing our present mode of living. Tell them,<br/>it
                            is a great work, that cannot be done immedi-<br/>ately; but that we are
                            the way disposed, and<br/>hope it will take place gradually.</p>

<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> remained several weeks
                    a-<br/>mongst the Indians, during which time, they<br/>visited a number of their
                    towns and villages, at<br/>all of which they were received in the
                    most<br/>friendly and hospitable manner.</p>
<p>In the course of their journey, they passed<br/>by a settlement of the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>, at <a href="/places/browt">Brown’sTown<placename key="browt"></placename></a>, or the Rock. They found that the
                    In-<br/>dians at this place, had, since the visit made by<br/>Friends to their
                    nation, in the year <date when="1799">1799</date>, ad-<br/>vanced considerably
                    in agriculture: many of<br/>them having built comfortable houses, and
                    ac-<br/>queried a considerable number of cattle, hogs,<br/>and other domestic
                    animals. And they were in-<br/>formed from good authority, that the <a href="/organizations/wyandot">Wyandots<orgname key="wyandot"></orgname></a>,<br/>residing at <a href="/places/sand">Sandusky<placename key="sand"></placename></a>, as well as the <a href="/organizations/shawnee">Shawanees<orgname key="shawnee"></orgname></a>,<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_037" n="37"></pb>on the <geogname key="augl">Auglaize</geogname> river, and also since the visit,<br/>turned their
                    attention very much towards the<br/>cultivation of their lands. They had
                    therefore<br/>the satisfaction to remark, that the communi-<br/>cations from the
                        <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> to these nations;<br/>and the
                    exertions which had been made, to<br/>turn their minds to agriculture; although
                    we<br/>had not been in a situation to extend much<br/>assistance to them, had
                    not been altogether<br/>unavailing.</p>
<p>They also visited the place fixed upon for the<br/>settlement of <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash<br/>river</geogname>, about forty miles south-west of <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>; and found its situation to be very
                    ad-<br/>vantages for farming; the soil appearing to<br/>be equal in fertility,
                    to any land in the western<br/>country. To this place there are also two
                    good<br/>mill-seats adjacent; one on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, which<br/>may be improved without injuring its
                    navigation,<br/>and the other on a stream which falls into that<br/>river, about
                    half a mile below</p>
<p>Soon after their return home, a letter was re-<br/>ceived by the committee, from
                    the Indian agent<br/>at <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, informing
                    them that the Indians<br/>had held their council in the Sixth
                    Month,<br/>agreeably to expectation; at which 874 of<br/>them attended;
                    <said>when the written address of<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_038" n="38"></pb><a href="/people/gelli1">George Ellicott<persname key="gelli1"></persname></a> and <a href="/people/ghopk1">Gerard T.

                        In-<br/>dians on behalf of the Society of Friends,) was<br/>produced, read,
                        and interpreted to all the diffe-<br/>rent nations present.</said> In reply
                    to which, divers<br/>of their chiefs expressed great satisfaction;
                    and<br/>amongst others <a href="/people/toeth1">Toethteboxie<persname key="toeth1"></persname></a>, on behalf
                    of the<br/><a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a>, said, <said>For many
                        years before I<br/>came into the world, the white people have<br/>been
                        offering to do for us, what is now men-<br/>tioned; and it appears, that our
                        eyes were never<br/>opened, until this time. We will now take hold<br/>of
                        it, and receive it. I am an old man, and<br/>want to see it before I die. If
                        I once see it,<br/>I shall die in peace, to think I have left my<br/>women
                        and children in comfort.</said></p>
<p>On the return of the friend*, <note rend="asterisk" resp="author">[* <a href="/people/pdeni1">P.
                            Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>, probably.]</note> who went out<br/>with the <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, and remained in the Indian<br/>country,
                    during most of the year <date when="1804">1804</date>, he re-<br/>ported that he
                    spent the time agreeably with<br/>them; and was favoured to enjoy a good
                    portion<br/>of health whilst there. He raised about 400<br/>bushels of corn,
                    besides a quantity of turnips,<br/>potatoes, cucumbers, water-melons,
                    pumpkins,<br/>beans, parsnips, and other garden-vegetables;<br/>which he
                    directed to be divided amongst the <br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_039" n="39"></pb> Indians on their return
                    from their hunting<br/>camps;and left with the family of Indians,<br/>with whom
                    he resided, upon the farm he had<br/>cultivated, 23 hogs and pigs, seven of
                    which<br/>were in good order to kill, and he expected<br/>would weigh 1500 lb.
                    These he engaged the<br/>agent to attend to the killing and salting of.<br/>They
                    were small when brought to the farm in<br/>the spring, and had no other food
                    than what they<br/>gathered in the woods.</p>
<p>With some assistance, which he obtained<br/>from <a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, he cleared and enclosed un-<br/>der a substantial
                    fence twenty acres of ground,<br/>and built a house, thirty-two feet long and
                    se-<br/>venteen feet wide, a story and a half high, with<br/>floors and
                    partition.</p>
<p>He further reported that the Indians, who<br/>remained with him, were very
                    industrious, and<br/>attended to his directions. The young women<br/>wished to
                    work in preparing the ground and<br/>attending the corn. From this he dissuaded
                    them;<br/>and as some spinning-wheels had just arrived at<br/><a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, which had been sent by Govern-<br/>ment,
                    he encouraged them to go there, and<br/>learn to spin and knit, of a white woman
                    who<br/>happened to be at that place. This they did,<br/>and soon learned both
                    to spin and knit ; and he<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_040" n="40"></pb>left them knitting yarn of their own
                    spinning, when<br/>he came away.</p>
<p>He also reported, that a considerable number<br/>of <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel-River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> Indians were
                    about to<br/>settle near the place he cultivated; and that<br/>previously to his
                    departure, he was with several<br/>of their principal chiefs; who requested him
                    to<br/>tell Friends, that they, and the Indians gene-<br/>rally, were much
                    obliged to them for the assis-<br/>tance they had given them; and hoped
                    we<br/>would continue our friendship towards them,<br/>and that nothing might
                    happen to discourage<br/>us.</p>
<p>All the Indians he was amongst, were very<br/>friendly; as was also the agent and
                    other officers<br/>of the Government.</p>
<p>As it appeared that the Indians were very<br/>desirous of Friends continuing
                    their care to-<br/>wards them; and sending a person to take the<br/>place of
                        <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>. After weightily
                    consider-<br/>ing the subject, it was concluded to endeavour<br/>to procure a
                    suitable friend for that purpose;<br/>but none offering to engage in service,
                    and<br/>the committee taking into consideration the low<br/>state of their
                    funds, and the advanced season of<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_041" n="41"></pb>the year; together with the
                    dissatisfied and unset-<br/>tled situation of the Indians at the time, on
                    ac-<br/>count of a sale of land made by some of the tribes<br/>to the United
                    States*; <note rend="asterix">*The uneasiness, which this circumstance
                        occasioned<br/>amongst the Indians has since been entirely removed.</note>
                    thought it might, for the<br/>present season, be best to write to the
                    agent,<br/>and request him, to procure for us, the most<br/>suitable character
                    in his power; who, under his<br/>direction, should plough the land which
                        <a href="/people/pdeni1">PhilipDennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> cultivated the last
                    season, and plant it<br/>with corn: in the performance of which it was<br/>hoped
                    he would be assisted by the Indians.<br/>We also observed, that after their corn
                    was<br/>planted, we were willing to believe they would<br/>be able to manage it
                    themselves. Should a<br/>second ploughing however be necessary, we<br/>directed
                    this also to be done. This person was<br/>also desired to prepare for them a
                    garden of the<br/>most useful vegetables, which they might after-<br/>wards
                    easily manage.</p>
<p>The <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a> have since received his
                    answer<br/>to this letter, in which he says, he will lose no<br/>time in
                    complying with their request, and that<br/>he will at all times be ready to put
                    the benevo-<br/>lent concern of Friends, towards the Indians, in<br/>execution.
                    He also says, that at this time, a<br/>spirit of industry exists among the
                    Indians<br/>generally; and that, as several of the tribes,<br/>had requested of
                    Government, to have a part<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_042" n="42"></pb> of their annuities expended in the
                    employment<br/>of men, to split rails, and make fences for them,<br/>the
                        <a href="/organizations/delaware">Delawares<orgname key="delaware"></orgname></a> had twenty-three
                    thousand<br/>rails put up into fences, the last winter; and<br/>that forty
                    thousand more would be made into<br/>fences for the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> and <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel-River Indians<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a>,
                    by<br/>the first of the Sixth Month. He adds, that ten<br/>families of the
                        <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a> have settled adjoining the<br/>place
                    cultivated by <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>; and that<br/>four
                    men were employed in making rails to<br/>fence forty acres for them; also, that
                    three<br/>persons more were at work for the <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel-River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a><br/>Indians, half a mile below <a href="/people/pdeni1">Dennis’s<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> station;<br/>that they had twenty-five acres cleared
                    and<br/>ready for the plough, and he expected would<br/>have fifty or sixty
                    acres fenced in by the first<br/>of the Sixth Month. He further adds,
                    that<br/>he expects at least twenty five families of In-<br/>dians will remove
                    to reside at that place the<br/>present season, and he is confident the
                    settlement<br/>will increase very fast. The Indian who worked<br/>during the
                    last season with <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> was<br/>about
                    building himself a comfortable house, had<br/>cleared two acres more of ground,
                    and was<br/>ploughing the field previously cleared by <a href="/people/pdeni1">PhilipDennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>. The hogs which were left there with<br/>him,
                    had increased to one hundred in number.</p>
<p>The agent further says, that there would be<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_043" n="43"></pb>one hundred acres of
                    land under good fence, at<br/>the <a href="/places/lturtown">Little Turtle’s
                        Town<placename key="lturtown"></placename></a> (eighteen miles north<br/>of <a href="/people/pdeni1">Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>’s station), by the first of the Sixth<br/>Month; where
                    they had also obtained a large<br/>number of hogs, and some cows; and he
                    doubts<br/>not, but that the Indians will soon see, that it is<br/>easier to
                    raise food, than to procure it by hunt-<br/>ing; and adds, Friends may see, from
                    the great<br/>progress they have made in civilization, since<br/><a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a> was with them, that they only<br/>want
                    good and suitable men to reside amongst<br/>them, and teach them how to
                    work.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding there are several other na-<br/>tons, who appear desirous of the
                    assistance and<br/>care of Friends; yet from the limited state of<br/>our funds,
                    we have heretofore been under the<br/>necessity of confining our aid,
                    principally, to<br/>the <a href="/organizations/miami">Miami<orgname key="miami"></orgname></a>, <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel-River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a>, and <a href="/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> Indians.</p>
<p>It will be perceived, that during several years<br/>of the first labours of the
                        <a href="/organizations/bymindian">committee<orgname key="bymindian"></orgname></a>, but little<br/>progress was
                    made. This may be attributed, in<br/>a great measure, to the pernicious effects
                    of<br/>ardent spirits amongst them. As soon as the<br/>introduction of this
                    great evil into their country<br/>was restrained, there was an immediate
                    im-<br/>provement discoverable; and an almost univer-<br/>sal disposition seemed
                    to pervade them, to aban-<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_044" n="44"></pb>don their former habits of living, and
                    turn to<br/>the cultivation of their lands. Their progress<br/>in civilization
                    has, since then, been much more<br/>rapid, than the most sanguine could have
                    ex<br/>pected; and on comparing the condition of these<br/>Indian tribes, at the
                    time the last deputation from<br/>our committee visited them, with their
                    present<br/>situation, we are of opinion, that there is great<br/>cause of
                    encouragement for Friends to persevere<br/>in the benevolent work they have
                    undertaken;<br/>and strong ground to hope, that our labours<br/>will, in the
                    end, be crowned with the desired<br/>success.</p>
<p>When we reflect on the gradual, but con-<br/>tinued decrease of these people,
                    from the time<br/>the Europeans first visited this continent, until<br/>the
                    present; and the many whole tribes, of<br/>which not any trace now remains,
                    except their<br/>names; there is every reason to believe, that<br/>should the
                    Indians continue to pursue their<br/>former mode of life, a few centuries
                    more,<br/>many other whole nations of them will become<br/>entirely extinct.</p>
<p>Impressed with this melancholy consideration,<br/>it must be a prospect truly
                    gladdening to the en-<br/>lightened Christian mind, to survey the
                    hasten-<br/>ing of that day, when this part of the human fa-<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_045" n="45"></pb>mily, weaned from savage habits, and allured by<br/>the superior advantages of
                    civil life, shall ex-<br/>change the tomahawk and scalping knife for
                    the<br/>plough and the hoe; and instead of ranging the<br/>forests in seeming
                    affinity to the wild beasts of desert,<br/>shall peacefully and rationally
                    enjoy<br/>the productions of the fruitful field!—Nor is<br/>this all. Added to
                    the cultivation of the earth,<br/>the first step in the view of the
                    committee,<br/>the first step in the view of the committee,<br/>towards many
                    other important temporal advan-<br/>tages, to be derived o this people from
                    civil<br/>life; may not the promotion of this concern,<br/>which has thus far
                    evidently prospered, prepare<br/>for, and prove the means under the DIVINE
                    BLES-<br/>SING, through which, may finally spread and<br/>prevail amongst these,
                    our fellow-men, that<br/>LIGHT and KNOWLEDGE, which so eminently<br/>distinguish
                    the true CHRISTIAN?</p>

                POSTSCRIPT.
                <opener>SINCE this narrative was prepared for<br/>publication, a letter has been
                    received from the<br/>agent at <dateline><a href="/places/fwayn">Fort-Wayne<placename key="fwayn"></placename></a>, dated the <date when="1805-10-05">5th of
                            the<br/>Tenth Month, 1805</date></dateline>, in which he says,</opener>
<floatingtext type="letter">
<dateline><date when="1805-10-05"></date></dateline>
<p>Agreeably to the directions of the commit-<br/>tee, I have employed a man
                            to assist the Indians<br/>in cultivating the field on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, which<br/>was cleared and cultivated
                            by <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
<date when="1804">last<br/>year</date>. The Indians with the man’s
                            assistance<br/>have raised, it is supposed, at least six
                            hundred<br/>bushels of good corn from this one field, ex-<br/>clusive of
                            what they have raised from ground<br/>of their own clearing.</p>
<p>Many of the oldest of the <a href="/organizations/eel">Eel-River<orgname key="eel"></orgname></a>
                                and<br/><a href="/organizations/wea">Weas<orgname key="wea"></orgname></a> Indians have removed and
                            settled at that<br/>place, where they will be followed by
                            the<br/>younger branches of their tribes in the ensuing<br/>spring.</p>
</floatingtext>
<p>He adds, <floatingtext type="letter">
<p>Believing as I do, that the Society<br/>of Friends are desirous of a
                                meliorating the situa-<br/>tion of their Red Brethren in this
                                country, I will<br/><pb facs="SW_BYM1806_047" n="47"></pb>take the liberty to observe, that
                                the present is<br/>a very favourable time, to put in execution
                                their<br/>benevolent views, towards the distressed natives<br/>of
                                this land; and that much good may be done<br/>on the <geogname key="wabas">Wabash</geogname>, by sending one or two
                                suit-<br/>able men to reside amongst the Indians, and<br/>teach them
                                how to raise stock, and cultivate the<br/>earth. Witness what
                                    <a href="/people/pdeni1">Philip Dennis<persname key="pdeni1"></persname></a>
                                effected<br/>amongst them the last year. At a station where<br/>he
                                had every thing to begin, there are now at<br/>least four hundred
                                hogs and twenty cows; and<br/>the Indians at no village in this
                                country live so<br/>comfortably, as those at that place. If this
                                spirit<br/>of industry is kept alive for a few years, it
                                will<br/>certainly have a powerful influence upon the<br/>minds of
                                the Indians at many of the neighbour-<br/>ing villages. The Indians
                                have lately concluded<br/>a treaty with the United States, which
                                has<br/>settled all their jarring interests.</p>
