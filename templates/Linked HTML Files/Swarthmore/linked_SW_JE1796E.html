<p> The Joshua Evans journal that includes his trip to visit Native Americans in New
                    York State in 1796, Journal E, is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. It is one of seven Evans journals that will be
                    published in 2016. The encoding was done as part of the Native Americans and
                    Quakers project.</p>
</projectdesc>
<editorialdecl>
<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
<p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>
<p> On page 181, there is a marginal note reading "obscurely expressed" that may
                    refer to Evans's original notes, that involves a number of possible
                    substitutions written above two words in the entry. The words may also be edits
                    of Warrington if he felt that that Evans's language was unclear.</p>

<p>We set forward this Morning a little refreshed, and rode near<br/>40 Miles
                    through a Mountainous Country; the people seem to live well, and<br/>appear
                    open-hearted to receive friends, many being weary of their Teachers.<br/>As I
                    was very weak in body, we hired a Chair to ease me in travelling,
                    &amp;<br/>reached to our friend <a href="/people/smoor2">Samuel Moor<persname key="smoor2"></persname></a>'s

<p> We had two meetings here, one of which was held in <a href="/people/smoor2">S.M.<persname key="smoor2"></persname></a>'s House, large<br/>and satisfactory; and the other on a
                    mountain not far off: I marvelled at<br/>the kindness of the People, and their
                    openness to receive:<br/> we set<br/>forward for <a href="/places/annap">Annapolis<placename key="annap"></placename></a>, and that afternoon had a Meeting at <a href="/organizations/meetrand">Randolph<orgname key="meetrand"></orgname></a>,<br/>and though very rainy, it was large
                    and very satisfactory. The next day<br/>had a Meeting in a <a href="/organizations/bapt">Baptist<orgname key="bapt"></orgname></a> Meeting-house near; and another about ten<br/>miles off;
                    both were favoured seasons, and the people openhearted &amp; kind.</p>

                    nine Miles.<br/>This is a small Town of about 100 houses, standing on the Bason
                    so called, at<br/>the Mouth of <geogname key="annri">Annapolis river</geogname>,
                    where that empties through a narrow pas-<br/>sage into the <geogname key="fundy">Bay of Fundy</geogname>. Here the tide, it is said, riseth 30 feet. </p>

<p> A large room in the Tavern where we lodged, was freely offered to<br/>hold
                    Meetings in; Which was this day occupied, and a large Meeting held<br/>there to
                    good satisfaction, to the tendering of some hearts. -- We<br/>were requested to

<del>that</del> in a Vessel which was to sail that afternoon for<br/>
<a href="/places/newbr">New-Brunswick<placename key="newbr"></placename></a>; we thought it best to take
                    leave of them, and go<br/>on board. We were on the water all night, which was to
                    me very<br/>trying, as the motion of the vessel caused me to be very sick. In
                    about 22<br/>hours we landed: it is called about forty Miles from <a href="/places/digby">Digby<placename key="digby"></placename></a> to this <br/> place. </p>

<p> One who was called a Bishop of the Church of England, was<br/>with us on board
                    of this Vessel. The man was respectful, and desired to<br/>see my Certificate;
                    on it's being shewn to him, he commended it, and the<br/>Order settled among
                    friends; saying, It well agreed with his Sentiments.<br/>After this his kindness
                    towards me increased; for he came frequently<br/>to enquire how I was; saying,
                    "Friend Evans, are you any better: And<br/>when we parted, he gave me his
                    blessing, as also divers others did, in their <br/>way</p>

<p>At <a href="/places/newbr">New Brunswick<placename key="newbr"></placename></a> we had two large and

                    hearts, and bringing as I thought honour<br/>to the Cause of Truth; many
                    expressed their Satisfaction, and I admi<br/>red their solid sitting, as there
                    was long silence, and a number of them<br/>never before at any of our meetings.
                    It was the Lord's mercy; Blessed be<br/>his great Name; I am but as a worm, and

<p> Many of the People hereaway, have had an education amongst<br/>Friends, and are

<p>On the other side of this <geogname key="fundy">Bay<br/>of Fundy</geogname>,
                    there was not anything oppressed my mind with more sadness<br/>than the manner,
                    the former French inhabitants of the Place, which were called<br/>Neutrals, were
                    forced away from their improved Farms and Estates in this<br/>Part of <a href="/places/novas">Nova Scotia<placename key="novas"></placename></a>, by those acting under British
                    Authority, and Brit-<br/>tish Subjects coming in to inherit the fruits of their
                    Labor. I mention'd my Sentiments<br/> freely concerning such injustice taking

<p> This Morning, we went on board of a Boat with four Oars, and came about<br/>20
                    Miles to <a href="/places/dippe">Dipper-harbour<placename key="dippe"></placename></a>; here we lodged at
                    one Frenches, who <del>to</del> enter-<br/>tained us kindly &amp; refused taking
                    pay for it: Being yet only about half<br/>Way to <a href="/places/beavh">Bever-Harbour<placename key="beavh"></placename></a>, we went on board early next morning, and<br/>
                    coming thither, had a <a href="/organizations/meetbeav">meeting in that place<orgname key="meetbeav"></orgname></a> in

<del>people</del> desired us to stay longer, and have more: But I have found it
                    safest<br/>to leave the People hungring, rather than to stay to make additions:
                    I wish<br/>all who travel on Truth's account to guard against the Activity of

<p> Being kindly supplied with Horses, &amp; a man to<br/>take them back, we went on

<a href="/places/penob">Penobscot<placename key="penob"></placename></a>: As heretofore hinted there appears
                    to be much Openness<br/>amongst the inhabitants of this Eastern Country towards
                    Friends: I thought<br/>it looked as tho' "the fields were white unto Harvest;"
                    and that many seem<br/>ed weary of their Teachers: We had a <a href="/organizations/meetpenob">Small solid meeting<orgname key="meetpenob"></orgname></a> here the<br/>next day: After
                    which we crossed the <geogname key="pleas">River</geogname> to <a href="/people/rcoff1">Richard Coffin<persname key="rcoff1"></persname></a>'s.</p>

                    Passage; and I had to admire the goodness of the Lord,<br/>in opening &amp;
                    preparing my Way. Blessed be his excellent Name, doth<br/>my soul say,
                    tremblingly, in awful fear and Love. -- The next day<br/>we hired Horses to
                    cross a neck of Land about six Miles; and then went<br/>by water to <a href="/places/penob">Penobscot<placename key="penob"></placename></a>: Feeling Poor in mind, and hearing of an
                    Opportu-<br/>nity to go on further by Water, We had like to have gone, But
                    perceiv<br/>ing an Opening unexpectedly for a <a href="/organizations/meetpenob">meeting

                    was commendable, I was<br/>comforted, and some benefit perhaps was received by

<p>From <a href="/places/falmo">Falmouth<placename key="falmo"></placename></a> we came to <a href="/places/meetsand">Sandwich<placename key="meetsand"></placename></a>, where we had two<br/> meetings, one of

                    exercising, but I believe they ended well. Hard labour<br/>and much Poverty seem

<p> At which <br/>place we arrived on the <date when="1795-09-04">4th</date>. I was
                    much weary. We had two <a href="/organizations/meetcoho">Meetings<orgname key="meetcoho"></orgname></a> the
                    day<br/>following, being first day; One of them was held in a
                    School-house<br/>in a good degree solid; the other in a <a href="/organizations/bapt">Baptist<orgname key="bapt"></orgname></a> Meeting house, large, but<br/>interrupted by the people's
                    going out and in: It is often so, when we consent<br/>to hold meetings in the
                    houses which belong to People of other Societies.<br/>I believe we ought
                    carefully to feel our way, even when their houses are offered<br/>freely. Here I
                    met with my friend <a href="/people/hhull1">Henry Hull<persname key="hhull1"></persname></a> from <a href="/places/9part1">Nine Partners<placename key="9part1"></placename></a>.</p>

<p> I had a Meeting in <a href="/organizations/meetsharo">Sharon<orgname key="meetsharo"></orgname></a> near Bassett's, which was large; but it<br/>suffered Loss
                    by a friend's speaking rather too much about his own<br/>Convincement: My Mind
                    was distressed hereby; And my desires are that<br/>Friends of the Ministry may
                    be well guarded against branching out<br/>improperly, when silence might be more

<p> At <a href="/organizations/meetdanby">Danby<orgname key="meetdanby"></orgname></a> we had a meeting that was large, and
                    exercising. I thought<br/>the people's minds were too much outward, and not

<p>Next at Walling's<br/> valley, a little village, we had a large &amp; good
                    meeting; where there<br/>had not been any held by friends before: A <a href="/organizations/bapt">Baptist<orgname key="bapt"></orgname></a> Minister<br/>was present, who seemed to be
                    tendered. --- The height of the<br/>mountains here seemed awful, exceeding any
                    that I had seen:<br/>Some people suppose that much more rain and snow fall on
                    them<br/> then doth in a level country. --- Oh! the sympathy I
                    have<br/>perceived for those who dwell in these rough places; many of

                    la-<br/>bour amongst them was afforded; several things opened in my

                    tobacco,<br/>and I had to tell the <del>people</del> I was apprehensive these

                    they<br/>rather came in by stealth, as a thief in the night, and stand
                    behind<br/>the curtain of custom (as many other evils do; causing weak-<br/>ness
                    among us as a people: Yet that I believed the Lord's refining work<br/>would go

<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_08" n="128"></pb> and that a reformation is begun;
                    Therefore let not the little<br/>ones be discouraged; For though the first who
                    step forth to change<br/>evil customs may meet with exercise and sore conflicts,
                    yet<br/>as they stand simple, &amp; keep humbly resigned to the Lord's

<p>This Morning I visited a Settlement of the People called Sha-<br/>kers, who
                    seem'd to receive me kindly, yet were much reser-<br/>ved. I informed them I had
                    felt my mind drawn to visit them<br/>in love, and if they were free to sit down
                    with us, if anything<br/>arose in any of our minds, we might speak freely;
                    adding also<br/>that I had often heard of them, but did not see any of their
                    sort<br/>before now: One of them then said, he expected some things
                    report<br/>ed of them might be true, and some false: He then leaving us,
                    (I<br/>suppose he went to consult with his Brethren,) but soon return-<br/>ing,
                    he asked if I was born in this Country, and of what pro-<br/> fession I was? I
                    told him I was one of the People called Quakers;<br/>and shew'd my certificate;
                    After he read it, he asked if he might<br/>shew it to some in the next room;
                    which I allowed him do:<br/>He then went in again, where, by that time, I
                    suppose many were<br/>collected in Council; I heard them read over my
                    certificate, which<br/>after some time was brought back, and I was told they
                    found I was an<br/>approved Minister of that Society &amp; was on a long
                    journey; I informed<br/>him I was on my return; and if he had freedom I should
                    be willing<br/>to know something of their Principles: He then informed me,
                        They<br/><said who="undetermined">believed in Christ Jesus, and in his
                        second appearance, and endea<br/>vored to live up to the Scriptures, and to
                        follow Christ: being Members<br/>of his Church thro' the baptism of the holy
                        Ghost: and coming under the</said><br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_11" n="131"></pb> the cross: This, he said, had crucified
                    every fleshly lust, and given<br/> them power to resist the tempter: That also,
                    they held <del>that</del> it was not right to<br/>marry, but that the World was
                    wrong, and laid in Sin, &amp;c. He seem'd<br/>confident in supposing their
                    Tenets to be right in respect to marriage, and that they take up<br/>the cross
                    to lustful desires, and go beyond others in self-mortification, &amp;c.<br/>With
                    respect to their Worship, he informed me they came together<br/>every evening,
                    took a solid pause, and if the Elders feel any thing to<br/>arise with weight,
                    they were permitted to speak; they also sing the Songs<br/>of Solomon, use
                    dancing &amp;c. I informed him of our belief concer-<br/>ning the benefit of
                    Silence, and of Spiritual Worship; and advised him<br/>to beware of being over
                    confident in supposing they had witnessed grea-<br/>ter Attainments than others.
                    He told me they believed George Fox to<br/>have been a good Man, until he mixed
                    with the World; that then he fell<br/>away, and there had been a falling away
                    among us till this time; and we<br/>had lost our gift of discerning, &amp; had
                    in our Church many rotten, or defected Members,<br/>But they (the Shakers) he
                    said, had that Gift, &amp; had sought out some of<br/>the most deep &amp; hidden
                    Sins, &amp;c: -- I let him know I feared they were<br/>mistaken, not being so
                    whole as they thought themselves to be. --- This man<br/>appear'd to be sober
                    &amp; well-behaved. He said they all lived in Love, and in<br/>one family, and
                    portion'd out each one's labour, according to their ability:<br/> They have many
                    Mechanicks, and some are appointed to inspect the work<br/> before it is Sold;
                    appearing to maintain Credit by honest dealing, &amp;c. -<br/>They seem
                        <del>appear</del> to be much United, do not act without consulting together,
                    and -<br/>move as in a body, This Man told me farther, they did not receive any
                    as Mem-<br/>bers if they had wronged any person, until they had returned
                    fourfold: and when<br/>any one joined them, his Property is put into public
                    Stock; &amp; if he should leave <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_12" n="132"></pb> leave them, he is to take out what he
                    first put in, &amp; no more. They ap<br/>pear to be a decent industrious people;
                    and on the whole, I thought better<br/>of them, than before I went to see them. </p>
<p> I understand the women among these People, were much by themselves;<br/>They
                    spin, knit, sew, weave, and manage the Houshold Affairs. </p>

<p> The monthly Meeting at <a href="/organizations/meethoosi">East Husack<orgname key="meethoosi"></orgname></a> being held
                    now, I attended<br/>it, being a large gathering &amp; a favoured season in the
                    fore part: I sat<br/>with Women friends while they answered the queries: where a
                    deep search was<br/>made into the State of Things, to my comfort: I then sat
                    with the Men in<br/>the like Exercise: But life seem'd to be wanting: I thought
                    there was a dis<br/>position to answer evasively, and unless they were more
                    weighty in the<br/>business, The queries might become a snare to them. </p>

<p>At one place <del>I confess</del> I was grieved, at seeing so large preparations

                    next<br/>day had a small dull meeting at a friend's house; and to me, mournful.

<p>We visited another settlement of those called Shakers: after a<br/>solid
                    conferrence we were permitted to see the women, who appeared<br/>plain and
                    sober; one of them, and antient Woman, spake in a free<br/>and friendly way,
                    asking several questions: She seemed well satisfied<br/>with my answers, and
                    invited me to come again. Their Head-dress was<br/>much the uniform: and
                    although I had some satisfaction in the visit, I feared<br/>they were too much
                    unacquainted with the Cross of Christ; yet they<br/>speak of living under the

                    respect to holding a meeting at this place, as the number is small,<br/>and the

<p>The day following in the afternoon, we<br/>had a dull heavy Meeting at a place
                    called the <a href="/organizations/meetwbran">Branch<orgname key="meetwbran"></orgname></a>, and the 8th.<br/> had one
                    at <a href="/organizations/meetnewmi">New-milford<orgname key="meetnewmi"></orgname></a>; which was low in the
                    forepart; untill some<br/> gay people not of our perswasion came in; unto whom I
                    believe<br/>the Lord had regard, for ability was received to extend gospel
                    labour<br/>for their benefit: as a lukewarm drowsy spirit was to be felt <br/>before<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_14" n="134"></pb> before they came in. This was the

                    But matters appeared to be in a low State. --<br/>At the close of the first
                    Meeting, I felt a desire to have a<br/>meeting with the inhabitants of

<p> Next I attended the Monthly Meeting at <a href="/organizations/meetoblon">Oblong<orgname key="meetoblon"></orgname></a>, which was an<br/>exercising time; I fear'd barrenness

                    choaking the good seed: I had <br/>some close labor which appeared to be well
                    taken; The day follow-<br/>ing I attended the select Meeting at the same place,

<br/>appointed for the Youth, at my desire: which was a solid favoured

                    was brought into view; and a weigh-<br/>ty Care urged in the education of

                        <br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_17" n="137"></pb> that he was convinced of the

                    one another; and they appearing<br/>so lamblike, he believed it was Truth's
                    language: I thought, from<br/>this instance, how much effect simple Plainness
                    hath, even when observ-<br/>able in children: and how much more if grown people
                    &amp; Parents were<br/>properly concerned to live up the pure inward principle

<p> I had a solid opportunity with a naughty young man, the only <br/>Son <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_18" n="138"></pb> Son of his father; I intreated him to

                    otherwise he would not, either<br/> here or hereafter: using much freedom with
                    him, as one who resembled the<br/> prodigal Son the parable, he appear'd to take

                    tendered, &amp; minds instructed and edi-<br/>fied; which divers freely and
                    openly expressed: So that we parted in near<br/>Love, a sense of which I hope
                    will not soon be forgotten: Let the Name of<br/>the Lord be blessed. </p>

<p> The day following was a publick <a href="/organizations/meetnp">Meeting<orgname key="meetnp"></orgname></a> at
                    the<br/>same place, larger than their large Meeting-house could contain;
                    in<br/>which a good degree of solidity prevailed. Yet I thought the Meeting was
                    hurt <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_19" n="139"></pb> hurt by too much preaching: It is

                    that <emph rend="underline">Spirit and</emph> life<br/>which gives victory over

<p>Coming to <a href="/places/ehart">East Hartford<placename key="ehart"></placename></a> where a number
                    dwell<br/> who by convincement have of late been joined to our Society, I
                    attended<br/>their <a href="/organizations/meetehart">Meeting<orgname key="meetehart"></orgname></a> on first day
                    forenoon; Also in the afternoon when notice was<br/>further spread, we had a
                    large and favoured Meeting: but it was somewhat<br/>injured by the publick
                    appearance of one towards whom<br/>Care was extended.</p>
<p> In the evening also we had the largest meeting ever seen at this<br/>place; and
                    tho' the crouding of the people was some hindrance to its'<br/>Settlement in
                    quietude, yet the seasoning virtue of Truth was perceived<br/>by many: insomuch,
                    that near a hundred persons, after the Meeting<br/>concluded, were loth to
                    depart from the house; I felt my mind engaged in<br/>exercise on their account;
                    but went to lay down, that I might rest a little;<br/>After they had conferred
                    together, a solid young man came, and told me<br/>they desired another
                    oppertunity, as the evening meeting was so crouded. This<br/>proved to be a time
                    of much favour: to shew them that I was no Impostor<br/>I caused my Certificate
                    to be read near the close: This lasted till near<br/>midnight: such a solemnity
                    prevailed, that it seemed not easy to separate.<br/>I did believe the Truth came
                    into dominion this evening: May the Lord be<br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_20" n="140"></pb> praised who is alone worthy, saith my Soul.</p>

<p>Feeling a draught in my mind to go and visit a Clergyman named <a href="/people/perki1">Perkins<persname key="perki1"></persname></a> in <a href="/places/whart">West
                        Hartford<placename key="whart"></placename></a> who<br/>had shewn some bitterness towards friends; and
                    although some thought<br/>it was likely he would treat me with contempt, I was
                    most easy to go,<br/>being accompanied by two friends: when we went to him, he
                    treated us<br/>friendly beyond our expectation, saying he had attended at
                        <del>one</del> one Mee-<br/>ting, and was well satisfied with what I said: I
                    replied, if thou wouldest<br/>lay aside forms and ceremonies, I think we shall
                    be likely to agree in<br/>the parts which are essential: he then said, he
                    believed the Scriptures to<br/>be the only rule of faith and practice, and that
                    revelation had ceased. I en-<br/>deavoured to open my Sentiments to him in
                    freedom, That the Scriptures<br/>appeared to be a sealed book, and the true
                    meaning of many parts not to be ob-<br/>tained, except thro' the assistance of
                    the same Spirit which gave them forth,<br/>That the divine principle of Light
                    and Grace which we preach up, and<br/>testify unto, is that, which if attended
                    to, brings to the knowledge of<br/>God; That the Spirit of Wisdom which inspired
                    the Penmen who<br/>wrote the Scriptures, is surely to be preferred before that
                    which was<br/>written under its' Influence, &amp;c, altho' he said he believed
                    in free grace<br/>yet he continued to urge the Scriptures being the only Rule,
                    other Con-<br/>versation followed, yet it appeared he was loth to yield to any
                    Sen-<br/>timent different from what he had been accustomed to endeavour
                    to<br/>uphold, according to their Creed: I let him know before we parted, that
                    I<br/>thought he knew better than he spake. </p>

                    my<br/>self honestly: reminding them of the Indians above mention'd, for whom I
                    was<br/> concerned, as much of the land had been obtained from that
                    People<br/>under value, &amp; some of it very unfairly, That now it was right,

<p> Travelling homewards about 30 miles, I had in the Evening at a<br/>Friends house
                    some edifying conversation: I fear it is too often other-<br/>wise, and that the
                    Cause of Truth is at times hurt, and perhaps honest enqui-<br/>rers stumbled,
                    and friends weakened, when they come together, by light<br/>conversation on
                    worldly, or trifling Subjects. Had a Meeting at<br/><a href="/people/rrand1">Rob.t

                    peoples' minds from the pursuit of<br/>earthly riches, to that treasure which is
                    durable: But to my grief, I was<br/>afraid the inhabitants (when the late rod
                    was withdrawn) too many were<br/>turning, like the Sow, to that of wallowing in

                    whereupon<br/>I was concerned to bring into consideration, whether high,
                    luxurious<br/>eating &amp; drinking Cider, Wine &amp;c, plentifully, with
                    smoking tobacco,<br/>did not tend in some measure to alter the state of the

<p> That of paying a kind attention to the Situation of the Native<br/>Indians who
                    dwell near us, by visiting them, &amp; inspecting as well as helping their

                    I seemed almost<br/>ready to give out, the appearance was gloomy, and the
                    floods<br/>ready to swallow me up; I feared also the Lord was about to
                    hide<br/>his face from me: ---- I said, Suffer me not, O Lord, to fall
                    a<br/>prey to mine Adversary: I know my help is in thee. -----<br/>Next day I
                    visited some in deep affliction of body, who<del>m</del> I thought<br/>were in
                    favour with God, a comfortable feeling. </p>

                    strength; and I had close labour to discharge<br/>both amongst Men friends and
                    the Women, to my own satisfaction, and to<br/>theirs, as far as appear'd. I was
                    led to treat on the pernicious Effects<br/>of a worldly Spirit, and a sumptuous
                    way of living, aiming at fine<br/>Houses, rich furniture, particularly large
                    looking-glasses &amp;c, &amp;c:. <br/>Returning <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_26" n="146"></pb> Returning home I visited several sick
                    persons to our mutual<br/>Joy. At our week day meeting, were a large number of
                    Youth; a good<br/>Meeting crowned with the divine presence. </p>

<p>For six days I have been about home, &amp; done little good.<br/>Instead of

<p>My mind was inclined to attend a neighboring Mo.ly Meeting, but<br/>the Adversary
                    endeavour'd to defeat me here also: I was kept lingering<br/>about home till it
                    was almost too late; when trembling seized<br/>me; &amp; I said, <quote type="biblical">let me not fall by the hand of Saul</quote>; I was
                    favoured<br/>with a little Strength to press thro': and my bow was renewed,
                    so<br/>that I had a favoured Opportunity, both amongst Men and Women
                    friends.<br/>I was engaged to speak to Parents and Children concerning a<br/>
                    worldly spirit, and the inconsistency of Superfluity in dress and<br/>
                    furniture; and had to press in plain Language the evil of these<br/>Things;
                    believing it was not a time for speaking smooth Words. It was<br/>thought the

<p>I was at our Monthly Meeting at <a href="/organizations/meethaddo">Haddonfield<orgname key="meethaddo"></orgname></a>,
                    Where the<br/>Minutes of our <a href="/organizations/pym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="pym"></orgname></a> were
                    revived which advise against <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_27" n="147"></pb> a worldly Spirit, &amp; mention it's
                    weakening effects in leading to the<br/>vain customs of the World in dress
                    &amp;c: I was led on this oc-<br/>casion to speak plain, and closely urge my
                    friends to a proper<br/>attention to this advice, with other matters
                    recommended; It appear'd<br/>evident to me that giving way to fleshly ease, and
                    a worldly Spi-<br/>rit, was the ground cause of a defection in our Society,
                    &amp; a depar-<br/>ture from that Simplicity which the dictates of the blessed
                    Truth,<br/>if strictly observed, would lead into. Some of the rich can
                    scarce-<br/>ly bear this kind of doctrine, especially Parents; The
                    Children<br/>sometimes appear most tender. -- I had also to express my
                    fears<br/>respecting the dangerous consequence of friends mixing with
                    others<br/>in promoting a School at <a href="/places/haddo">Haddonfield<placename key="haddo"></placename></a> for instructing Youth in the<br/>French Language:
                    as it might be a snare to entangle some of<br/>the dear Youth, &amp; expose them
                    to the Company of those of a loose<br/>conduct &amp;c. Tho' some seemed to
                    disapprove of my freedom in this<br/>respect, several both Old and young united
                    with my Sentiments. </p>

<p>I was at <a href="/organizations/meetwoodb">Woodberry Monthly Meeting<orgname key="meetwoodb"></orgname></a>: where a
                    worldly spirit<br/>was again treated on, with its' effects: I opened my
                    Sentiments on what<br/>relates to extortion; and had to advise my friends not to
                    seek the largest<br/>Prices when they were about to sell, Meat or other produce,
                    especially to<br/>those in low circumstances: This appear'd to be a low time:

                    give not the alarm at the approach of the<br/>enemy. It appear'd that now
                    worldly spirit was advancing fast<br/>into our Society, &amp; for want of

<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_31" n="151"></pb> many with their sons and their

                    Alteration; and that now Rye<br/>and Corn sold for so high a price, and other
                    things high also, Friends<br/>example in moderation might be loud preaching;
                    even if we<br/>could submit to supply the poor at one third lower than the<br/>
                    highest price; what a pleasant Savour it would yield in the<br/>country round

                    go at<br/>our bidding: But ourselves, who are bought at a higher price,

                    keep his holy Law: Thus, are we not more stubborn than the brutes?<br/>If the

                    disobedience? -- We may consider for our-<br/>selves; As we whip harder for the
                    second Offence, may we not look<br/>for the same measure ourselves, if still
                    disobedient? As the inhabi-<br/>tants of this place have been lately visited by
                    the rod of Sickness,<br/>and many numbered to the silent Grave, of different

                    years old, &amp; the other blind, about 60, for whom I have been<br/>concern'd
                    that they may be properly cared for: a committee was appointed to<br/>attend to
                    their Case. </p>

<p> Sitting with the <a href="/organizations/pymind">Committee on Indian Affairs<orgname key="pymind"></orgname></a>, I
                    was concerned<br/>to open my Sentiments concerning the propriety of taking the
                    situa-<br/>tion of our Jersey Indians, under care, as well as those more
                    re-<br/>mote from our dwellings: as I remember to have heard my father<br/>
                    often mention the Indians Kindness to our Predecessors in the Jer-<br/>seys,
                    when they were few, &amp; the Indians many. </p>

                    enabled<br/>to do what I believed to be my part, faithfully. The same day was
                    at<br/>a place where a marriage dinner was soon to be provided for my
                    young--<br/>est son, I had to open my mind on the subject of such
                    entertainments<br/>freely, &amp; with some weight: pressing the necessity of
                    true Moderation, and<br/>advising against what has crept in relating to the
                    ceremony of particular<br/>waiting on the Bride &amp; Groom so called, My advice

                    was small, I attend-<br/>ed, and was pleased to see a good degree of right order
                    observed. Much loose<br/>and disorderly conduct at might be prevented by timely

                    &amp; Extortion that seem visible among<br/>older Ones, which produce mournful

                    which desire prevailed, so that a time<br/>was fixed, all uniting therewith
                    except one person who had lost his right<br/>amongst us: He went to the others,
                    with a view to discourage their attending, and <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_36" n="156"></pb> and then told me he had seen them; that
                    they did not purpose to attend<br/>neither did he: I said, he might use his
                    Pleasure: I intend to go to<br/>the place, and if none came, I could sit quietly
                    by Self, and had <del>nothing</del><br/>nothing prepared to say. Yet at the set
                    time, the Friends all came, except<br/>that Man's Wife, and we had a favourd
                    season which had a uniting ten-<br/>dency; I could say I was thankful for it,
                    that I loved them, and did -<br/>believe they loved me.</p>

                    the<br/>People, I seem'd constrained to stand near two hours on my feet;
                    which<br/>almost surprised me: it having been uncommon with me to stand
                    above<br/>half so long; This was a highly favoured season, and many

                    afternoon,<br/>low times to me: I thought many of us were got into a state of
                    easy<br/>indulgence in many things, and are not soon to be removed from<br/>
                    Beds of Ease: I tried at it a little, yet not to much purpose. I hinted<br/>
                    that the benefit &amp; well ordering of this large <a href="/organizations/nym">Yearly
                        Meeting<orgname key="nym"></orgname></a>, wou'd<br/>much depend on the wise Conduct of those in
                    high Stations: guarding<br/>well their own Example &amp; Conversation, and then
                    watching over younger<br/>People carefully; checking their going on formal
                    visits from house<br/>to house; that if favoured to receive a little good, they
                    might lose it's Sa-<br/>vour, or learn bad fashions or unprofitable Customs, by
                    getting into Com-<br/>panies, and indulging Vanities, so as to be in danger of
                    returning<br/>from such a Solemnity worse than when they came to it: That of
                    sitt-<br/>ing up late in the Evenings, &amp; laying in bed late in the mornings
                    I had also to<br/>mention my belief, it was unprofitable for Body and Soul. I
                    thought<br/>this kind of Doctrine seemed rather hard or close for me to

<p>At one Sitting of the select Meeting, on 4th day morning, The truth<br/>appeared
                    to have comfortable dominion: My mind in the liberty thereof was<br/>emboldened
                    to inform my brethren and Sisters of my exercise on observing a<br/>custom to
                    prevail in the <a href="/places/nycit">City<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> which I thought was not
                    right; and if I differed from<br/>all my friends in Sentiment I hoped I might be
                    excused; It was that of employ-<br/>ing men to do women's Work in houses,
                    &amp;c: That I did not doubt there being wo-<br/>men enough, healthy, &amp;
                    capable of business if their minds were applied<br/>thereto, to do all that was
                    necessary in Families: And as provisions were dear,<br/>and men's labour high
                    rated, they had better be imployed in the fields, or<br/>out door business, than
                    at Womens work; If the young Women were to be<br/>brought up in a course of
                    family industry, and to rise early in the<br/>morning, I believed it might
                    contribute to health, and tend to fit many of<br/>them better for business,
                    &amp; the managing houshold affairs, if they should<br/>come to need that, than
                    if brought up in an easy delicate Manner: having<br/>seen some such in my time
                    who have been reduced to great hardship and<br/>unable then to minister to their
                    own necessities; and perhaps there may<br/> be instances of this kind proceeding
                    out of Families where men had<br/>been employ'd to do women's Work, and children
                    indulged in a delicate idle<br/>life. Tho' my testimony on this head seemed to
                    go hard with some<br/> to whom it might seem applicable, Yet I found it had the
                    concurrence<br/>of many friends who expressed unity therewith. It was also
                    proposed by<br/>one friend that a Minute of the substance of the concern be
                    taken on<br/>their book which was <del>also</del> agreed to. -- This was a
                    memorable time, the<br/>Power of Truth in dominion, lofty Spirits chained down,
                    the rich &amp;<br/>great having to submit to the simple discipline prevalent in
                    the present sea-<br/>son <br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_40" n="160"></pb> In a
                    following sitting of Ministers &amp; Elders the same<br/>concern was
                    strengthened by others and friends in the city &amp; country closely
                    ad<br/>vised to attend to the Contents of what was taken on minute at the
                    former<br/>Sitting. The Bow seemed (as I believed) to be at this season, renewed
                    &amp;<br/>strengthened by the Lord's Power, in the hands of some little
                    Ones,<br/>who had to shoot their Arrows against the Queen of Pride. I did
                    not<br/>find my self clear without also hinting my exercise on the growing
                    Custom<br/>of friends having fine Carpets, and flowery Things in their rooms;
                    which<br/>I believed were not brought into use by the dictates of simple Truth,
                    and that<br/>a number of such matters might well be spared, and thus help
                        <del>might</del> be<br/>administerd towards warming and covering many of the
                    Poor. </p>

<p>The <a href="/organizations/nym">Yearly Meeting<orgname key="nym"></orgname></a> ended the <date when="1796-05-28">28th</date> with a publick Meeting.<br/>I was exceedingly stripped that
                    Evening; having to confess with the<br/>Prophet of Old, "I am a Worm, and no
                    man." So great was my poverty<br/>that I feared I should murmur; there seeming
                    to be no sense of good left.<br/>But I tried to get into quietude, therein to
                    know what further the<br/>Lord had for me to do. </p>

<p>Next day being the first of the Week, there<br/> were held 3 meetings in the

                    appointed<br/>for the Youth of all descriptions: These were large and
                    I<br/>thought ended well, yet not so highly favoured as some have been.</p>
<p> Here I parted with my beloved Friends <a href="/people/jwigh1">J.

<p>Musing on the State of Things, I fear'd that since the late<br/>mortality, The
                    People in this City are grown rather Worse than <br/>better <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_41" n="161"></pb> better: This is cause of grief to many

<p>Next day I left <a href="/places/nycit">New-York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a>, as one having none
                    Inheritance on earth;<br/>travelled about 40 miles to <geogname key="croto">Croton River</geogname>, and had a pretty<br/>large meeting that evening on
                    Short Notice, which proved reviving, and satis-<br/>factory, believing it ended

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1796-06-01">6th. mo. 1st</date>
<placename key="osweg"></placename></dateline>
<p>I went about 40 miles further to a friend's House near the<br/>
<geogname key="nrive">North River</geogname>: and the next day, was at their
                    week day Meet-<br/>at <a href="/organizations/meetosweg">Swago<orgname key="meetosweg"></orgname></a>, which was small,
                    yet in measure favored; after<br/>which I visited an aged friend under bodily
                    affliction: <del>of body</del><br/>but in a heavenly frame of mind: Who,
                    although his Pain was<br/>great, refused the taking of Laudanum as a medicine,
                    lest it<br/>might tend to stupify his Senses, near the close of Life, by
                    it's<br/>benumbing Effects; I much approved of his religious Caution
                    herein:<br/>fully believing it has often been handed out by Doctors in an
                    unrigh-<br/>teous manner; which in some instances may injure the
                    clear<br/>understanding of departing Souls, in their last Moments.</p>
<p> I am informed by a friend who says he had it from the<br/>Mouths of two
                    merchants in <a href="/places/nycit">N. York<placename key="nycit"></placename></a> who were in Partnership,
                    That<br/>in the Summer of last year, they imported from the East Indies<br/>
                    Teas, and Silks: on which the duties which were to be paid, amounted<br/>to more
                    than one hundred thousand Dollars. And as it is<br/>said much of those Duties
                    goes towards defraying the expences of<br/>War, I do not see How friends can
                    consistent with a clear testimony<br/>to that pure principle which stands
                    against all cruelty and<br/>bloody measures, freely purchase and use the Goods,
                    on which such Duties <br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_42" n="162"></pb> duties are
                    laid; it being (as I take it,) generally agreed that<br/>those who use or
                    consume the Articles so circumstanced, do<br/>pay the Duties. Such are my tender
                    scruples &amp; Testimony;<br/>and so I leave it for others to look at, perhaps
                    when I am<br/>dead and gone; believing it to be what was given me to bear,
                    and<br/>attend to in simplicity and integrity of heart. <br/>

<p> I proceeded on my Way and came to <a href="/people/zgree1">Z. Green<persname key="zgree1"></persname></a>'s:
                    had a solid<br/>time in his family: several young Women were there, &amp; it was
                    a satis-<br/>factory season. I also visited an aged woman friend, of a
                    heavenly<br/>mind as I believed. I have to wait a little for a companion;
                    feeling<br/>inward Calmness: This I take to be a divine Gift, to support

<p>Crossing the <geogname key="nrive1">North River</geogname> here, we proceeded
                    westward toward <a href="/places/unadi">Unedilly<placename key="unadi"></placename></a>:<br/>I felt myself
                    as a Stranger in a strange land; yet perceived a<br/>little something which
                    inwardly sweeten's the mind: The next day<br/>we went much the same Course,
                    thro' a Wilderness, where the<br/>mountains were admirably high, which seemed
                    awful; and travel-<br/>ling was very difficult among Roots, Rocks and Mire:
                    Sometimes we <br/>seemed <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_43" n="163"></pb> seemed to be surrounded in such a manner
                    with mountains as -<br/>though there would be no way. Here it was hinted to
                    mind, "Look not<br/>outwardly, but to the Lord, &amp; the Path:" I then felt
                    more easy, scarcely<br/>daring for a while to raise my head, or look about me.
                    The Road -<br/>also continued difficult the next day, but I was favour'd with a
                    sweet<br/>calm: -- I thought perhaps many of my friends were in another<br/>way
                    toiling themselves, in trying to get riches, &amp; leave their Children<br/>
                    rich, and I struggling along thus might <del>migh</del> come to die out-<br/>
                    wardly poor: But my mind was touched on this wise; Thy Riches<br/>come another
                    way; if thou art faithful, thy reward shall be sure,<br/>and sufficient. </p>

                    it seemed a<br/>discouraging circumstance in a wilderness place; But going a
                    little further on<br/>we obtained lodging; &amp; were informed he lived about
                    fifteen Miles dis-<br/>tant. --- The following day about noon, we reached to

                    near 160 Miles through a remarkable road<br/>for difficulties. I have no cause

                    tender-<br/>ness in these Meetings: and my heart was affected on hearing of
                    the<br/>Cries of some of the Poor for want of bread; It seems they have an
                    <br/>extortionate <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_44" n="164"></pb> extortionate teacher, or Priest, to
                    maintain, and a great scarcity<br/>of grain here; Some have been (they say)
                    several days without bread.<br/>Also some who went 30 miles to buy, &amp;
                    brought the Corn home on their<br/>backs. We called at one place, where was a
                    woman and three Chil-<br/>dren besides one at her breast; whose husband was out
                    seeking bread.<br/> She said they had been two days without, and knew not
                    when<br/>he would return. It was almost more than I could bear to hear
                    of,<br/>&amp; observe the situation of these poor Children; That called
                    the<br/>House they sheltered in, was, a few logs put up, and brush thrown<br/>
                    on the top; When it rained they suffered much, having to stand<br/> or sit the

                    the last especially, the hearts of<br/>many were melted into tenderness. With

<p>We now took leave of our friends of this place in much near-<br/>ness: it seemed

                    acquaintance, and we were kindly received by a Son of <a href="/people/jslee1">JohnSleeper's<persname key="jslee1"></persname></a>: The next day had a pretty large Meeting to
                    good satisfaction <br/>in <br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_45" n="165"></pb><br/>in a

                    education,<br/>which ended to my comfort and theirs also: We found them in<br/>a
                    tried Spot: Some who had come hither to settle, appearing in
                    measure<br/>friend-like, had conducted in a shameful, dishonest way, rather
                    drunken,<br/>and disposers of goods which were sent here damaged &amp; of
                    small<br/>value; endeavouring to cheat, &amp; take advantage of Poor People
                    &amp;c:<br/>Such had left a stink behind them, and caused the way of Truth<br/>
                    to be evilly spoken of, to the grief of some tender spirited little ones.<br/>O
                    the mischief and wrongs some Traders are guilty of, profess what<br/>they may,
                    who send into those new Countries, Old Shops Goods, not<br/>easily to be sold in

                    people &amp; new Settlers; Will not the Cry of these<br/>corrupt deeds reach the
                    ears of Heaven's King, and call for a scourge<br/>on the workers of such
                    Iniquity. Having been an Eye wit-<br/>ness &amp; mourner on these accounts, or
                    having cause to believe the<br/>Truth of such Complaints, I think I shall not
                    stand clear in my<br/>duty, without making, and leaving remarks as things occur.

<p> On first day the 19th. had a Solid quiet Meeting in the barn<br/>above mention'd
                    which I thought ended to the honour of Truth: This<br/>was supposed to be the

<p>We went to see some families, two of which were my eldest Sis-<br/>ters
                    daughters, they live at <a href="/places/otego">Otego<placename key="otego"></placename></a>: Also had a

                        Coggeshal<persname key="ncogg1"></persname></a>'s, remarked for a time of<br/>favour. A deacon of the
                        <a href="/organizations/bapt">Baptist<orgname key="bapt"></orgname></a> Society at the conclusion, said<br/>he
                    could say, Amen, to the testimony which was preached; that not<br/> a word had
                    been spoken but what he united with; and altho' he<br/>was old, he never had
                    been at a friends' meeting before. I then<br/>return'd to my beloved friends

<p>I was this day in a low state of mind: Rode to <a href="/places/coopt">Cooper's-town<placename key="coopt"></placename></a><br/>on the east end of <a href="/places/otego">Otego<placename key="otego"></placename></a>; a Spot beautiful for Situation. Here<br/>unexpectedly,
                    we were kindly received by <a href="/people/wcoop1">Wm. Cooper<persname key="wcoop1"></persname></a>, then
                    Judge<br/>of the Court, &amp; his sister , altho' Strangers. He queried whether
                    I stood <br/>in <br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_47" n="167"></pb> in need of Money,
                    and if I did, he was willing to supply me, he said.<br/> also unknown to me, he
                    wrote an Order, that if at any time, whilst<br/>in these northern parts, I
                    should have occasion, I might draw<br/>on him, which he would cheerfully answer.
                    -- Finding the roads<br/>very difficult, here I sold my waggon, &amp; some other
                    things, and<br/>provided myself to ride on my mare, with the kind assistance of<br/>
<a href="/people/wcoop1">Judge Cooper<persname key="wcoop1"></persname></a> &amp; his sister; having cause to
                    remember them both:<br/>we had a solid, good meeting at this place, which to
                    some, was a<br/>tendering season. </p>

<p>The 25th. in the morning we left <a href="/places/coopt">Cooper's-town<placename key="coopt"></placename></a>,<br/>and travelled near 50 miles to <a href="/places/duane">Duane's-Bush<placename key="duane"></placename></a>; This was as try-<br/>ing as my nature
                    could well bear: Towards the latter part we came<br/>to a family of poor Irish
                    people: Here we got down to rest ourselves &amp;<br/>horses a little, it being
                    very warm weather; and I much fatigued; Here tho'<br/>not at all agreeable, I
                    thought we must stay that night: Yet were, <del>af-</del><br/>
<del>ter</del> after resting awhile, favour'd to reach <a href="/people/wbrig1">Walter Briggs<persname key="wbrig1"></persname></a>'s, our desired<br/>Place. -- The next day, had two
                    pretty large Meetings held in<br/>a Barn at <a href="/places/duane">Duanes-bush<placename key="duane"></placename></a>; one of which was a favour'd time; the other<br/>
                    more exercising, the minds of the People being outward. </p>
</div>
<div type="entry">

<p> We had a meeting at <a href="/people/wbrig1">W. Briggs<persname key="wbrig1"></persname></a>'s, in a new
                    framed house, which was<br/>large, &amp; ended well; the people appearing solid.
                    We have no cause to<br/>murmur: we want for nothing, The Lord being good, and
                    doth marvel-<br/>lously open the way: Unto whom be all Glory &amp; Praise,

                    some, who seem likely to ac-<br/>quire a large Share of outward wealth, whether

                    as there never had<br/>been a meeting of the kind here before; and I believe
                    this did not<br/>cause any dishonour to the <del>cause of</del> Truth: I am now

<p>Travelling near 50 miles towards <a href="/places/white">Whitstown<placename key="white"></placename></a>,
                    pretty comfort-<br/>ably, we reached that place on the <date when="1796-07-02">2nd</date> before noon. There I met<br/>with my neighbor <a href="/people/jcoop1">J. Cooper<persname key="jcoop1"></persname></a>, &amp; other friends appointed to visit
                    the<br/>Indians: And finding freedom to join them, we went in Company<br/>that
                    afternoon to an Indian Settlement called <a href="/places/broth">Brotherton<placename key="broth"></placename></a>: I under-<br/>stand the number of these Indians is
                    about 200, They have Cows,<br/>Horses, Oxen &amp;c: <del>and</del> hold as yet a
                    Tract of good Land, about ten thou-<br/>sand acres, and have an yearly income
                    paid by <a href="/places/newyo">New-York<placename key="newyo"></placename></a> Go-<br/>vernment of 2000
                    dollars for Lands sold thereto. ---<br/>We were comfortably entertained by an
                    Indian named <a href="/people/gcros1">GeorgeCrosley<persname key="gcros1"></persname></a>; this is a
                    kind family, speaking our language, and we find their daugh-<br/>ter can read
                    and write pretty well. </p>
<p> As I have from my young years, been friendly disposed towards<br/>the Native
                    owners of our American Lands, and especially since Reli-<br/>gion began to have
                    place in my mind, have been often concerned on ac-<br/>count <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_49" n="169"></pb> count of the wrongs and unfair dealings
                    of my brethren the white<br/> Settlers of different Ranks, with Traders &amp;c,
                    which have, I fear,<br/>taken Place in too many instances, to the great injury
                    of the poor<br/>Indians; I have therefore thought it right to leave some remarks
                    to<br/>posterity, here, and in other parts of my simple notes, of my
                    Senti-<br/>ments which have occured on this subject. ~ It appears that<br/>in
                    years back, some of the Indian Lands in this govern-<br/>ment where I now am,
                    were by them rented to some white-<br/>people who settled thereon: After thus
                    obtaining possession,<br/>it seems those professed Christian white settlers
                    refused to go off their rented lands:<br/>also those who were in stations of
                    government supposing, or<br/>pretending they could not easily remove them, even
                    if the In-<br/>dians were the sufferers; <del>and</del> therefore advised that
                    the lands<br/>be sold to the government; and to promote a Sale, perhaps
                    an<br/>offer was made to the Indians, that an interest tho' much less than their
                    Value or yearly<br/>Income should be paid them in lieu of their Lands: Now to
                    turn<br/>the scale, &amp; look at the treatment they have met with heretofore
                    in<br/>some places; How do we suppose the White people would remove<br/>Indians,
                    if they were to come intruding and settle on the real property of the
                    Whites?<br/>Would it not be likely that the Method of expelling them<br/>by
                    sword and gun would be adopted, without endeavoring to convince<br/>or shew
                    them, that the mild spirit of Christianity leads men to do<br/>justly &amp;
                    strictly, to observe Equity one towards another in every nation<br/>where it
                    prevails. To me it remains a serious cause of real Concern <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_50" n="170"></pb> that in a Country of Professing
                    Christians, whose predecessors<br/>were permitted to come and settle on a part
                    of the soil, allotted by<br/>Divine Providence to native owners who are our
                    brethren of his Creation: Who have been<br/>renowned both before &amp; since the
                    corruption they imbibed through<br/>the Fraud &amp; bad example of white men, to
                    be in general, kind and<br/>hospitable, as well as remarkably punctual to their
                    engagements: That<br/>these poor natives in so many instances should justly have
                    cause to com-<br/>plain of wrongs, impositions, &amp; unchristian treatment,
                    through breach<br/>of contracts, unjustly grasping after and obtaining their
                    Lands, besides<br/>the great abuse and disadvantage they have received by the
                    hateful<br/>practice of introducing strong Liquor, Whisky &amp;c, among a weak,
                    unguar-<br/>ded &amp; uncivilized People: And that these Complaints should
                    undeniably<br/>fix upon Men more knowing &amp; civilized, who if the Spirit of
                    the religion they profess was attended to<br/>would find it incumbent on them to
                    shew forth a very different Conduct, or a<br/>treatment and Disposition much
                    more likely to instruct, civilize and convert<br/>those whom they term a savage
                    &amp; barbarous People. </p>

<p> ... To day we had two comfortable meetings at <a href="/places/broth">Brotherton<placename key="broth"></placename></a>,<br/>attended by many of the Indians, both men and
                    women. This People,<br/>or many of them appear'd to have a deep sense of Favour.
                    We parted<br/>with them in much Love, and went to another Indian Settlement called<br/>
<a href="/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a>, lodging at the house of a Chief
                    called <a href="/people/haupa1">Captain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a>. </p>

<p>The Committee having agreed to hold a Council with the <a href="/organizations/stockbridge">StockbridgeIndians<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a><br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_51" n="171"></pb> Indians, I attended also. This was in consequence of Friends concern<br/> for
                    their benefit &amp; advancement in civilized life, and a desire to aff-<br/> ord
                    them some assistance by giving them impliments such as axes, <emph rend="underline">howes</emph>,<br/>&amp;c. This conference was not so
                    satisfactory as we could desire; these In-<br/>dians then shewing rather a
                    coveting disposition, or looking for larger<br/>gifts from friends than was
                    proper to expect, or for them to be supplied<br/>with so hastily: perhaps their
                    expectations had been by some means<br/>imprudently raised before our coming to
                    see them. --- Before we<br/>parted from this Council, so called, the Indians
                    were informed that at<br/>two hours from that time, I proposed to have a meeting
                    at the same place<br/>where we now met them. --- In consequensce of which notice
                    a large<br/>Number of them, men and women came together; It proved to be
                    an<br/>exercising Season, life was much wanting; many of them were
                    ignorant<br/>in our language, so that an interpreter was made use of, and I felt
                    my<br/>self poor at parting. -- I understand that the Portion of Land
                    wch<br/>these <a href="/organizations/stockbridge">Stockbridge Indians<orgname key="stockbridge"></orgname></a> possess,
                    is said to be 23,000, Acres, and their<br/> number is about three hundred: Also
                    that their yearly income from<br/>the Government is 600 dollars; which might
                    yield them more benefit<br/>if a considerable part of it went not, or was not
                    spent in Strong<br/>drink, which I suppose has manifestly been too often the
                    Case. </p>

                    (who are but few or about 60 in num-<br/>ber) we went to the settlement of
                        <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneida Indians<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, where was held a<br/>Council
                    so called. Things here were not very pleasant, The Indians seem<br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_52" n="172"></pb> seem at times unsteady &amp; fickle; by
                    some means they were not plea-<br/>sed, &amp; the interpreter disordered with
                    strong drink; these circumstan-<br/>ces were very trying; But we informed them
                    we were willing to have another<br/>meeting, which was proposed for religious
                    worship in the afternoon.</p>
<p> This happened to be more trying still; for the Intepreter was so drun-<br/>ken
                    &amp; poor a creature, I had but little freedom to speak by him, if suit-<br/>
                    able matter had opened; so that my Sorrow was increased on seeing so<br/>much
                    drunkenness among Indians. -- From hence we returned to<br/>
<a href="/places/stock">Stockbridge<placename key="stock"></placename></a>, &amp; tarried there again that
                    night; <a href="/people/haupa1">Captain Hendricks<persname key="haupa1"></persname></a> seems to<br/>be a

                    where three friends<br/>propose staying a while among the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> to instruct them; with<br/>whom we had a solid parting
                    season: after this, as many Indians<br/>were come together near our departure
                    from the Place, My desire<br/>was<br/><pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_53" n="173"></pb>
                    was mention'd of sitting under yonder Trees a little while with as<br/> many of
                    them, both men and women as were willing to come toge-<br/>ther there, (shewing
                    the place;) Upon which about 150 came; some<br/>of whom being painted Red, black
                    &amp;c, seemed to make a frightful<br/><del><gap></gap></del>Show as they sat on the
                    ground; yet on the whole, their appear-<br/>ance was then more solid that at the
                    former times when we were with<br/>them: so that our parting with the <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a>, was in a way Mostly<br/> friendly: -- And
                    yet as a portion of Death and darkness was per-<br/>ceived rather than a
                    pleasant feeling among them on these Visits:<br/>altho' perhaps in their way of
                    civility, their custom of saying,<br/>Yough, is to give <del>of</del>
                        assent<del>ing</del> to what they hear deliver'd to them, yet to me<br/>it
                    was unpleasant at this time; and I have my doubts concerning some
                    things.<br/>This afternoon we went on about 12 miles towards the <a href="/places/onond">Onon-dagoes<placename key="onond"></placename></a>; and having to lodge at an Indian
                    Tavern, it seemed to<br/>be a poor time: Yet I felt my mind quiet in a good
                    degree, which<br/>I esteem a high favour in these times of Trial. </p>
<p> The <a href="/organizations/tuscarora">Tuscaroes<orgname key="tuscarora"></orgname></a> hinted of before, live on the
                        <a href="/organizations/oneida">Oneidas<orgname key="oneida"></orgname></a> Land, and<br/>have about two hundred
                    acres allotted them: and it is said a proportion<br/>of 4,500 dollars, perhaps,
                    annually from the government. I understand that<br/>murdering one another when
                    involved in drunkenness, frequently happens<br/>among Indians in these parts. Oh
                    that White People may be concern'd to con-<br/>duct so towards them, as not to
                    be found chargeable with Guilt on account of<br/>the Sins of Indians. </p>

<p>After riding about 18 Miles further, a Council (as they<br/>call it) was held
                    among those called <a href="/organizations/onondaga">Onondago Indians<orgname key="onondaga"></orgname></a>:
                    These<br/>seemed not well pleased; as we found they upon some grounds had
                    ex-<br/>pectations of larger gifts or help from friends than they were now<br/>
                    likely to obtain; This was trying again, and my feelings were un-<br/>pleasant
                    &amp; mournful; O the necessity of prudence and wise steering,<br/>if we propose
                    to be useful to these uncultivated fellow Men.</p>

                    visit to those<br/>called <a href="/organizations/cayuga">Cayuga Indians<orgname key="cayuga"></orgname></a> living
                    there, who seemed poor and miserable<br/>&amp; like the others, disappointed in
                    their expectations; We found their chiefs<br/>were not at home, and that the end
                    of our coming could not be answered to day,<br/>we proposed tomorrow to have a
                    meeting with some White People dwell-<br/>ing near.</p>

<p>So it being first day, we met, &amp; sat comfortably with a<br/>little gathering;
                    it being a favoured season: here were some of the<br/>scattered little ones,
                    with whom my heart was tenderly affected.<br/>In the afternoon we went to meet
                    with the Indians, having spoken to<br/>them on the subject the day before: and
                    altho' none came at the time<br/>proposed, we sat down, and I may say I was
                    comforted in our Sitting<br/>&amp; concluded we had done well, though these poor
                    creatures were very much igno-<br/>rant of what we mean by Worship. </p>

<p> On the 11th. a few Indians met with us in Council, who appeared misera-<br/>ble,
                    and some of them, I thought, then disorder'd with strong drink: we<br/>had but
                    little satisfaction, as they were looking for Gifts &amp;c. </p>
<p> Parting with them, I went from hence down the <geogname key="cayug">Cayuga<br/>

                    people<br/>whom I should not otherwise have seen. This Meeting, I
                    believe<br/>ended well; Let the praise be given to him who is our Holy
                    Helper.<br/>The next day, I was at <a href="/places/robin">Robinson<placename key="robin"></placename></a>
                    meeting on the west side of<br/><geogname key="schri">Schuylkill

<p>I was next at <a href="/organizations/meetexete">Exeter<orgname key="meetexete"></orgname></a>; not a large meeting, and
                    long in the<br/>gathering; when assembled it was but a poor low time. I <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_60" n="180"></pb> I thought I was sensible of a dry
                    lukewarm state; which is but too<br/> common amongst the highly favour'd People
                    called Quakers: O how<br/>the customs, the love and the spirit of the world have
                    caused dim-<br/>ness in some places. </p>

<p> The following day I had a small meeting<br/>at <a href="/organizations/meetpottt">Potts-town<orgname key="meetpottt"></orgname></a>; I thought the number of Women was largest here,
                    &amp;<br/>they the most tender. I had close labour amongst them, which was<br/>
                    well received, and I thought the meeting ended to the honour of the good<br/>
                    cause: Divers gay people attended &amp; sat solidly. </p>

                        <a href="/places/bucks">Bucks County<placename key="bucks"></placename></a>, in an exercised
                    &amp;<br/>low state of mind, and was at two pretty large meetings there on
                    first<br/> day, though I thought the truth was not permitted to come much

                    had a meeting, pretty large; but so poor<br/> and low a time, I was almost ready
                    to think all was over with me:<br/>I had less opinion of preaching; desiring the
                    people might have time<br/>to think of their condition, and to seek for renewing
                    of Strength: Are<br/>not many under our name in a self secure state, Seeming to

<p>The next Meeting I went to was at<br/><a href="/organizations/meetbucki">Buckingham<orgname key="meetbucki"></orgname></a>, which was very large, but laborious indeed;
                    Here<br/>I was sunk very low in my mind, began to think I was worse off<br/>than
                    in remote parts, or amongst the Indians: and near ready to say,<br/>Are we the
                    worst of all People, who above al, have been so pecu-<br/> liarly favored of the
                    Lord. Oh, Ease, lukewarmness and worldly Spirit, <br/>what <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_61" n="181"></pb> What havok have ye made! It almost
                    seemed to day as though I<br/>had done with preaching. Yet there is a little

                    to that <a href="/organizations/meetbucki">Monthly Meeting<orgname key="meetbucki"></orgname></a>: which ended well; I
                    believe the Truth<br/>reigned over all. Here I was helped to Labour in the
                    Lord's Cause, with<br/>Weapons of his own preparing; The Arrows came so sharp
                        <del>against</del> a-<br/>gainst wrong things, that at length there was a

                    State<br/>of their Business and the management of it, there was really
                    cause<br/>of lamentation: When life and Power is wanting, but little can be
                    done<br/>to the Lord's honour, in the affairs which relate to discipline in his

<p>I also attended a <a href="/organizations/checkPlace">general Meeting<orgname key="checkPlace"></orgname></a> held there.
                    At this time I thought<br/>it was given me to see clearly, there was a danger in
                    being too free<br/>in the use of A liberal flow of words in ministry; I fear
                    there is a<br/>possibility <emph rend="underline">of</emph> that some, <emph rend="underline">except</emph> unless they are better guarded, and speak

                        <a href="/organizations/meetwrigt">Meeting<orgname key="meetwrigt"></orgname></a> on first<br/>day. Preaching seems
                    to be looked for by many People, and<br/>that of a smooth kind pleases best;
                    this makes hard labour for<br/>those who singly seek to serve the great Master
                    uprightly: I<br/>think I have not been more sensible of this, than since I
                    came<br/>nearer home: Those are large Meetings: but I have been at<br/> some
                    much smaller, comparable to the two or three, with Minds tru-<br/>ly turned
                        <del>turned</del> to seek the fountain of life in themselves, which<br/>
                    have been much more favored with the divine presence.</p>

                    very<br/>comfortable season it was to myself, and to friends in general,<br/>I
                    believe. My mind has not been favour'd with such a sweet<br/>enjoyment of divine
                    Goodness since I came into this County: Blessed<br/>be the Great Shepherd of
                    Israel: If the tender-hearted little<br/>ones hold on their Way, I believe there

                    which ended<br/> well; and tho' laborious, I believe the Truth was in

                    had a pleasing prospect of some being brought forward into<br/>usefulness who,

<p>This was the select Meeting held at the <a href="/organizations/fallmm">Falls<orgname key="fallmm"></orgname></a> for
                        <a href="/organizations/buckqm">Bucks Quar- ter<orgname key="buckqm"></orgname></a>, at which I attended.
                    It appeared to be a lively time: and I<br/>thought that many things were well
                    handled: It was agreed as<br/>the general Sense of friends to form the answers
                    in the Meeting which are to be<br/>sent forward to our Queries; Pausing
                    weightily on each query,<br/>after reading it, and then endeavouring to
                    represent the real<br/>State; not seeking to hide or screen ourselves by evasive
                    Answers.<br/>The impropriety was opened of friends making too great
                    provision<br/>at Qu. Meetings &amp;c, by preparing many Sorts of dishes,
                    often<br/>changing Plates, causing needless Work: The necessity was also
                    hin-<br/>ted of the foremost rank beginning to prepare, &amp; lead the way
                    towards true<br/>moderation and temperance, their example being likely to have a
                    power-<br/>ful influence.</p>

                    so<br/>to almost give out trying to labor for the benefit of the Cause I<br/>I
                    had been engaged in. -- But going to see some poor little Ones<br/>in the
                    afternoon, I was a little comforted, and strength renewed; for<br/>I believe we
                    were own'd by the Master in some of our conferences,<br/> on weighty subjects.

<p>I have visited several friends; have had serious thoughts<br/>concerning
                    reformation; and have believed those who go fore-<br/>most in the work to real
                    Profit, must pass thro' great exercises<br/> for self must become of no
                    reputation, before we can bear the<br/>cross, &amp; despise the shame for Jesus
                    Christ's sake; And as it was<br/>with our worthy fore-fathers, Great trading,
                    and many worldly<br/>concerns, then "will be a great Burden": Fine houses and
                    rich furni-<br/>ture an Eyesore," with Sumptuous liveing, rich Tables, many
                    dishes,<br/>great attendance, and a lordly way of getting thro' the World
                    &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_65" n="185"></pb>
<p>In much sympathy with my fellow-members, my Spirit<br/>hath for some years been
                    deeply exercised on account of the state<br/>of things in our society: And I
                    have sometimes feared that wrong<br/>things of late have grown fast among
                    friends in a time of Peace<br/>plenty and Ease. Surely if we let hurtful weeds
                    grown, they check<br/>the growth of good seed; So will wrong things, if we
                    entertain them, check<br/>our Progress in the narrow Way that leads to life: In
                    that way, though<br/>strait &amp; narrow, there is liberty enough: And when we
                    through a patient<br/>coming to wear the Cross of Christ, come to experience the
                    Liberty of the<br/>blessed Truth, we may be then freed from that worst of all
                    Burdens, the<br/>world, and the idolatrous love thereof. ---- Oh that, if by
                    here<br/> leaving a few sentences of my earnest desire, as a call to the
                    beloved<br/> Youth of our day, I could prevail with many of them to come
                    taste<br/>and see how good the Lord is, to those who fully surrender
                    their<br/>hearts to his service; Then would your experience of his
                    matchless<br/>Love be sweet, and this language would often breathe forth, "Thy
                    Ways<br/>are ways of pleasantness, O Lord, and all thy Paths are Peace:"
                    At<br/>thy right hand are rivers of Pleasure, forevermore: For although<br/>the
                    Lord may see meet to hand unto you some of the Wormwood and<br/>the Gall to
                    partake of, Yet he will so sweeten the Cup to his little<br/>Ones who are his
                    sincere followers, that you will scarcely per-<br/>ceive the Bitters: My soul in
                    deep reverence can say, his Sweet<br/>Peace for obedience for submitting to his
                    requiring, has been sweeter than the <br/>Honey <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_66" n="186"></pb> Honey-comb. --- Oh that it was the happy
                    experience of all<br/>people, to submit to the refining Operations of the Grace
                    which is<br/>inwardly revealed; Then might they come to know the
                    in-dwelling<br/>of the peaceable Spirit of holy Jesus: This would put an<br/>end
                    to the quarrelling, &amp; Jarrs, to hard thoughts and hard Speeches,
                    and<br/>introduce in us the coming of his Kingdom: Men would thus be
                    taught<br/>and enabled to love enemies, &amp; to bear reviling for Christ's
                    sake:<br/>without reviling again: They would find no better way to gain
                    <br/>Victory, than by overcoming evil with good. However hard this
                    doc-<br/>trine may seem to be to the natural <emph rend="underline">will</emph>
                    of Man, many living<br/>Witnesses certainly know, that a state of this kind is
                    attainable:<br/>Therefore let no man's or Woman's heart fail them: All have
                    the<br/>offer of divine Grace and Assistance to overcome the evil part,
                    &amp;<br/>none are excluded who are willing to close in, &amp; obey the
                    teachings<br/>thereof; working while their day of Visitation lasteth; and often
                    bearing<br/>in mind, that "The night cometh, wherein no man can work." --<br/>O
                    that this might in some degree serve as a loud, loving<br/>call, to my
                    fellow-pilgrims, and sojourners throughout the Land. </p>

                    Meeting for <a href="/organizations/meetevesh">Evesham<orgname key="meetevesh"></orgname></a> on the <date when="1796-09-10">10th</date> I had<br/>close labour in true Love,
                    respecting the things which have <br/>appear'd <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_67" n="187"></pb> appear'd to me superfluous, and
                    inconsistant with <del>respect to</del> our<br/>ancient testimony, relative to

                    hint of elswhere in the minutes<br/> I have made; and my present concern was
                    well received as I believe.</p>
<p> The same day I visited a couple newly married, who had both of them<br/>former
                    companions; The woman was poor, &amp; the Man deemed rich;<br/>I was concerned
                    to speak closely on the snares and disadvantages<br/>which have frequently
                    attended second marriages, and the Necessity<br/>there is for such Persons
                    living steadily in the Lord's fear; and guard-<br/>ing against tempers, &amp;
                    party views about worldly interest, where they<br/>had children by former
                    marriage: The woman was tender-spirited and<br/>shed many tears: and I warned
                    the man to beware of cramping her.</p>

<p>I returned my certificate at our <a href="/organizations/meethaddo">Monthly
                        Meeting,<orgname key="meethaddo"></orgname></a> and gave my<br/>Friends some account of my late journey

                    my wife, Yet it<br/>seemed taken away from me after that: which was, of paying a

<del>I had a Meeting there, or</del> was at Meeting<br/>there on first day, at

                    commonly of<br/>longer lives than the white People, who live sumptuously<br/>on
                    the fruits of their Toil: The Slaves allowance for a<br/>week is in many
                    instances confined to a peck of indian Corn<br/>for one grown person, to cook it

                    &amp; treated on the<br/> subject of slavery, and their unrighteous Law which

                    Persons who are not free to hold<br/>them in Slavery: It afforded me comfort
                    that he acknowledged<br/>that Law to be unjust, hoped for its alteration, &amp;
                    proposed to use<br/>what influence he had for it's repeal. <del>or

                    open-hearted, is about building a new<br/>Meeting-house at her own expence. My
                    affectionate desire for her<br/> is that she may be preserved, so as to retain a
                    blameless character in<br/>the important Station she stands. </p>

<dateline>The <date when="1796-11-14">14th</date>. <placename key="suffc"></placename></dateline>
<p> was their Quar.ly Meeting for business here: dull and exer-<br/>cising <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_74" n="194"></pb> cising: I had close labour with Men and
                    Women, perceiving barren-<br/> ness among them: I hope it had some good effect
                    on some of the youth<br/>&amp; others, but I leave it. That Evening had a
                    meeting for the<br/>black people in a School-house near the <a href="/people/ascot1">Widow Scotts<persname key="ascot1"></persname></a>': It was the first<br/>of this kind
                    that was ever held in these parts, being large; One of the Jus-<br/>tices
                    attended, &amp; some other Masters of Negroes. It was a solid favoured
                    time<br/>and these spake well of the Meeting: some of them said they should be
                    very<br/>free their Negroes should be at such meetings, and were glad they
                    had<br/>been there themselves, uniting with what was spoken, and wishing
                    it<br/>might be observed.</p>

                    likewise large for the place, as well as solid and satisfactory.<br/>Some of the
                    people seemed rejoiced, not having much opportunity to be<br/>at friends

<p>Our next Meeting was at the <a href="/organizations/meetsbran">South Branch<orgname key="meetsbran"></orgname></a>, a
                    very exercising<br/>Season: I thought the desire of some was, that smooth
                    things, or peace<br/>might be spoken to them, believing they were too much in a
                    whole<br/>State, &amp; that there was but little room for labour. --- But
                    how<br/>can there be peace, where Pride and Oppression abound; The
                    slaves<br/>having to bear the burden; many of them sorely oppressed,
                    with<br/>want of proper Clothing, Food &amp;c, under Taskmasters, whose religion
                    seems<br/>to be in talking; The Land Barren or nearly worn out, and
                    their<br/>manner of Cultivation and Management but poor: So that the <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_75" n="195"></pb> Prospect of Things here looks gloomy
                    every Way. It is a trying<br/> circumstance to me, to See the naked Bodies of
                    slaves and cold wea-<br/>ther near, Whilst the Sons of their Oppressors, in an
                    idle life, ap-<br/>pear so different; and their haughty daughters with stretched
                    forth<br/>necks and wanton looks, their long-tailed gowns, trailing, as
                    tho'<br/>some of them might spare something to put on the naked bodies
                    of<br/>those who wait upon them. </p>

<p>We next had a small meeting near the great bridge at <a href="/people/rpool1">RobertPool's<persname key="rpool1"></persname></a> to Satisfaction: After which I had solid
                    Conversation with some<br/>gay women respecting their manner of dress, at a
                    house where we<br/>were kindly entertained; <unclear>my</unclear> Freedom with
                    them seemed to be well ta-<br/> ken: They appeared somewhat religious, but I
                    thought they wanted depth.<br/> they were not acquainted with friends, nor our
                    principles. One thing<br/>I mention'd for them to consider was, Whether some of
                    the Stuff in their<br/>Gown tails, &amp; the price of superfluous ribbonds,
                    might not well be<br/>spared to put something on the naked bodies of little
                    blacks, &amp;c. It was a<br/>solid season, and not resented, though I suppose
                    they never heard such sentiments<br/> before; We parted very friendly;
                        <del>and</del> rode in the Evening about 15 Miles,<br/>and had a solid time
                    with E.D. who said he was born at <a href="/places/eggha">Egg-harbor<placename key="eggha"></placename></a>

<p>We had a large and solid meeting at the <a href="/people/wbrit1">Widow

                    where never had been held one of our<br/> Meetings, and but few of the people
                    who ever had attended at one.</p>
<p> The next day also we had a large and favoured meeting in the same<br/>County, at
                    the <a href="/people/wrich1">widow Richardson<persname key="wrich1"></persname></a>'s; These seemed a kind
                    people, much<br/>unacquainted with our way, and many hearts were tendered: I
                    believe it was<br/>a time not to be forgotten by some.</p>

<p>At <a href="/organizations/meetpiney">Piney-Woods<orgname key="meetpiney"></orgname></a>, we attended Friends
                    preparative meeting: Here I had close<br/>Labour, things appearing in a low
                    state: I endeavored to stir them up to a<br/>more lively Zeal for the cause and
                    Testimony of truth; which they ap-<br/>peared to receive well. On the next day
                    was the Select Meeting at<br/>the same place, for their Quarterly Meeting. My
                    concern was to stir<br/> up to the pure part on the right education of Children
                    and Families,<br/>that becoming plainness might be kept to, and they be good
                    examples<br/>themselves, in their houses, furniture &amp;c. --- The day
                    follow-<br/>ing was held their Qu.ly Meeting for business: Here, I believe the
                    State of<br/>my friends in a religious sense was poor, but little life &amp;
                    power: I lab-<br/>oured both amongst Men and women in my small ability, for
                    their help,<br/>and I hope it ended to some profit at last: tho' a trying time.

<p>I went from hence to <a href="/organizations/meetlittle">Little-River<orgname key="meetlittle"></orgname></a>, being a
                    second time: and was at Meeting<br/>there on first day, which I believe ended
                    well. And in the after-<br/>noon had a Meeting in the Court-house of <a href="/places/pasqu">Pasquotank County<placename key="pasqu"></placename></a>; at<br/>which were many people, of
                    black and White; It was a season of <br/>general <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_77" n="197"></pb> general satisfaction. Many in great
                    tenderness signified their U-<br/> nity with me &amp; my service; and some
                    sincerely craved for my staying<br/> that night in their town: but I was easiest

                    we found some friends at the place, desiring to endeavor for an alte-<br/>
                    ration the cruel Laws relative to the Negroes. Having felt my mind much<br/>
                    concerned on the subject, I was willing to join my endeavours to theirs.</p>

<p>We attended the House of Common Council, had many private<br/>Conferrences with
                    Members, who received us friendly, yet seemed mostly op-<br/>posed to the
                    freedom of black People. </p>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_78" n="198"></pb>
<p>I was endow'd by my Great Master with an innocent boldness, in which<br/>I could
                    use great freedom in solid conversation with the most leading men; for<br/>they
                    mostly quartered where we did; which gave me a full opportunity to re-<br/>lieve
                    my oppressed mind. </p>

<div type="entry">
<dateline><date when="1796-12-08">8th</date>. <placename key="ralei"></placename></dateline>
<p>The prospect seems gloomy, whether any<br/>thing can be done at this time for the
                    Relief of our distressed fellow Men,<br/>yet I would not have my friends here be
                    discouraged: The Cause is Surely<br/>good; And I have no doubt but way will be
                    made for this poor people's libe-<br/>ration, but what way, or how Soon must be
                    left to the Lord. My mind was<br/>turned to think of trying for a religious
                    public Meeting in the place<br/>which some of those we conversed with, spake in
                    favour of, if the Way<br/>should be opened, and the Business they were met on,
                    would admit of it: It was<br/>also thought the house where they sat in would be
                    the most suitable place; But after wait-<br/>ing a while to see how matters
                    would turn with respect to a publick<br/>opportunity, it seemed scarce likely to
                    be obtain'd in the present Circumstances.<br/>I was therefore the more free to
                    make use of private opportunities<br/>with the Members of the Legislature and
                    others; which was to my own<br/>satisfaction &amp; to theirs, as far as I saw:
                    There being here now a<br/>large collection of those of the first rank,
                    Gentlemen, so called: most of<br/>them being Men in some Office, Civil or
                    military. I thought the res-<br/>pect they shewed me was marvellous: For my
                    simple Appearance, singular<br/>as it was, some of them confessed it was
                    instructive to them; that their own Conduct<br/>and way of living was luxurious,
                    &amp; they allow'd much might be spared; Saying that<br/> I looked as well s
                    they did, altho' they had great variety of roasted, baked,<br/>&amp; boiled
                    provisions &amp;c; whilst mine was about half a pint of milk and <br/>as <br/>
<pb facs="SW_JE1796E_Page_79" n="199"></pb> as much water, morning, noon and night
                    without any flesh; Boarding at one house, we<br/>generally sat at one Table.
                    Some at first looked at me with astonishment,<br/>and tho' they had never seen
                    the like, said they believed, or did not know,<br/>but it was the right way of
                    living, but it would be hard for them to sub-<br/>mit to. -- As they had private
                    Rooms, a number of them invited<br/>me (as it was at a tavern we were, &amp;
                    near 50 boarders all men of Note.) that if at<br/>anytime I was weary of noise
                    &amp; craved to me more retired, I might freely<br/>come into their rooms, &amp;
                    sit with them; &amp; that they should be pleased if I<br/>would make so free.
                    All this seemed to be in my favour to furnish<br/>me, when my mind was so
                    engaged, with opportunities to touch on their<br/>cruel Laws, the hardships
                    &amp; inhuman cruelties to which the poor blacks<br/>were Subjected in that
                    Government &amp;c. I queried of them Why Things should<br/>be in such a severe
                    Way here, more than in any other Place that I had<br/>heard of: For I had been
                    thro' each of the Governments Eastward, as well as <a href="/places/maryl">Mary- land<placename key="maryl"></placename></a> and <a href="/places/virgi">Virginia<placename key="virgi"></placename></a>
                    lately, and had not heard of any Cruelty of the kind<br/>sanction'd by any other
                    Legislative Body on the Continent: Some of them<br/>spake of other States not
                    having so many Slaves in them, and less occasion for<br/>fear of their rising
                    &amp;c; my answer to that was, Those who so cruelly oppress<br/>the Slaves, have
                    more occasion to fear their rising, &amp;c: My treating with them<br/>on the
                    subject was in a way of plain dealing, and so well received that<br/>many of
                    them kindly invited me to come and see them, if I should come near<br/>their
                    dwellings, for that it would give them pleasure (as they said) to entertain<br/>
                    me: It was unexpected also to my Companion &amp; myself, when he came<br/>to
                    Settle for our Tavern Expences whilst there, the Man would take<br/>no pay for
                    my Boarding, he was so well pleased with the visit. </p>

                    the Womens) was<br/>mostly Homespun, no black silk Cloaks nor Bonnets among
                    them, I was<br/>comforted in their Company &amp; parted with them in near love
                    and fel-<br/>lowship; after which visited two other Families, &amp; went on to
                    my friend<br/><a href="/people/hhowa1">Horton Howards<persname key="hhowa1"></persname></a>, whose Wife lay
                    ill with the Consumption; I perceived her<br/>to be innocent, laying in a quiet
                    frame of mind, as nearly fit to leave<br/>the World.</p>
