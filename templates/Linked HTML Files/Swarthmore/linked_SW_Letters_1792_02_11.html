<p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

<p> The President of the United States commands <br/>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/tlear1">T. Lear<persname key="tlear1"></persname></a> to return the enclosed paper, which
                    was <br/> submitted to the consideration of the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/people/gwash1">President<persname key="gwash1"></persname></a> last <br/> evening, containing the sentiments
                        proposed to be <br/> delivered, in writing, by the
                    Quakers to the deputation <br/> from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/organizations/cherokee"> Cherokee
                    <orgname key="cherokee"></orgname></a> nation of Indians now in this <br/> City and to inform, that the
                    President, upon <br/> a due consideration of the subject; does not see any <br/>
                    impropriety in the enclosed speech being delivered <br/> to the Cherokees, as it
                    contains the same friendly <br/> sentiments with which he has himself
                    endeavoured <br/> to impress these people and doesn't appear to be <br/> a
                    matter that can be drawn into precedent on any <br/> future occasion. Neither
                    has the President any <br/> objection to those Indians being furnished by the
                    <br/> Quakers with such small presents as were men- <br/> tioned to him last evening. </p>
