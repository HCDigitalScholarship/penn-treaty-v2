 Some account of my journey to the Seneca Nation of Indians and residence amongst that People After passing through various exercises on this
occasion and witnessing a full submision to the Divine will in regard to giving up all to follow him where ever he might be pleased to lead me; and
obtaining the aprobation of our Monthly Meeting at Londongrove and a Certificate from thence to the Committee on Indian affairs at Philadelphia
which was accepted and, I left at liberty to proceed in company with Henry Simmons and Halliday Jackson who also had prospects of going to reside
sometime amongst the Seneca Indians; Accordingly on the 30th of 4 mo. 1798 I left the place of my abode in East Marlborough and rode about three
miles to a friends house where according to appointment I met with Halliday Jackson, and the night following we  reached and lodged at the House of
Abraham Gibbons in Lancaster County where Henry Simmons met us, also John Pierce and Joshua Sharpless who had given up to accompany us to the
Seneca Country. 1st of 5 mo. being five in company we all set forward on our journey and lodged the night following at William Wrights at Wrights
ferry on Susquehannah. 2nd of the month crossed the River and rode to York, thence piloted by W.Kirk (a promising your Man) to John Garritsons and
Isaac Everots where we lodged that night and believe were heartily welcome. 3rd of the month being now out of the neighbourhood of Friends I shall
not be particular noteing the stages till we crops the Mountains, we trailed about 35 miles a Day along very rough and Mountainous roads still we
got to ConnellVille on the banks of the Yoxhioyany River in the settlement of Readstone, some of those high mountains whose summits seemed to
mingle with the Clouds afforded a prospect truly gratifying to me and displayed the wonderful world of Omnipotence more  the next night we lodged
at the House of a worthy friend Thomas Gibson, and were respectfully entertained, having been from home eight Days and traversed upwards of 250
miles by way of Shippensburg Strausburg and Bedford. 7th of the month three of our company went to Reece Cadwalders, halliday jackson and myself to
Union Town to see some of our old acquaintance that lived thereabouts, Halliday and I parted at William Dixons and I went to see my brothers and
Sisters that lived near that place, we were much rejoiced to see each other and I had a good degree of satisfaction in my visit, yet my stay was
not as long as would have been desirable, in the course of my journey through Readstone I observed that the land is of a supervisor quality,
abounding with a great quantity of excellent timber such as Black Walnut Hickory Wild Cherry and Sugar Maple from the latter many of the
inhabitants supply themselves with sugar and molasses of an excellent quality which is a great advantage to a new settled county. Stone Coal and
Iron Ore of an excellent quality abounds plentifully in this settlement and appears to afford encouraging prospects for Iron  works and
Blacksmithing. Limestone is also plenty here and the whole is encouragement for settlers, yet alas, there is one abominable practice which the
inhabitants has got into which I think has been a great hurt to them and their Country, that is destroying the grain that was given them for the
support of Life to make an article which tends very much to destroy both the lives and Souls of men, and set up the Kingdom of Antichrist, I have
often thought that Spirituous liquors is one of the strongest weapons the Adversary has to make use of in order for the upholding of his Kingdom,
for when people are enticed to drink large draughts of it, how easy they are lead in to an innumerable catalogue of evils such as gambling, lying,
swearing, fighting, and sometimes to murder. 9th of the month set forward again accompanyed by my brother and two brothers in law to Reece
Cadwaldies near Browns Ville where according to appointment I met with my travelling companions it being friends Meeting Day we attended their
meeting after which dined at our kind friends who heartily approbated us in our present undertaking and was very  kind and was friendly as was his
Wife and Family, after Dinner crossed the Monongahela River and rode about 13 miles to an Inn where we lodged that nigh and had but poor
accomodations, tho perhaps the best the House could afford. 10th of the month traveled about 24 miles down the aforesaid River and crossed again at
Pittsburg and took up our quarters at Wm Morrows Tavern where we met with good entertainment 11th of the month we spent out time in procuring some
Goods to send by Water to the Indian Country, some of our company went to the Garrison respecting our Goods that was sent from Philadelphia and
upon inquiry found they had arrived a few days before and General Wilkinson employed a wagon at the States expense to haul them to the River and a
Boat to to carry them from thence to our intended settlement. 12th of the month went again to the Garrison to see General Wilkinson who appeared to
have much good will for us, and the cause in which we were engaged, he gave us considerable information respecting the Indians  and an order on
George Fowler, deputy Quarter master at Ft. Franklin requesting him to furnish us with provisions or anything else we stood in need of at that
place, he also gave us a written speech addressed to Cornplanter and other Seneca Chiefs which is as follows To the Cornplanter and the
VillageChiefs of the Seneca Nation Friends and Brothers the bearer one of our beloved men from among the People called Quakers, Visits you with
several good Men from the same soceity, who intend to set down amongst you, in order to instruct our red Brethren in words of usefulness and to
point out to them the path ofVirtue which leads to the Blissful mansionsof the Great Spirit the Father of Light and Life- Brothers I charge you to
take our beloved man and his companions by the hand and treat them with kindness and sincerity, open your ears and listen to what they say open
your eyes and follow their footsteps then will your Old Men, your Wives, your Children and Childrens Children live in security and enjoy the
comforts of life Brethren and Children let this admonition sink deep into your Hearts and may you be Blessed with a clear Sky, smooth Roads and
plentiful harvests to the end of your days I commend you to the care of the Great Spirit and am in heart your friend Jas Wilkinson. Commander in
Chief of the Troops of the United States After spending a short time in conversation with James Wilkinson we departed (he accompanying us through
his Guard) and set forward on or journey, crossed the Allegany and travelled about 33 Miles to a poor little hut where we were obliged to put up
for quarters or Lodge in the woods, we however tied our Horses to Stumps & and fed them with feed we carryed with us, our lodging in the House
being on an earthen floor and very disagreeable it being the first time we had lodged  on the Ground 13th of the Month rode about 35 miles to Ft.
Franklin having a difficult Road and horse feed very dear, oats being about two Dollars per Bushel; we put up and lodged at John Andrews Tavern
where we got pretty good accomodations tho very dear 14th of the Month went to the Garrison to see George Fowler who appeared very oblidging, and
furnished us with what provender we wanted for ourselves and Horses, and expressed a willingness to take care of all our Letters and Goods that
came to his hands, and forward them to us if convenient, he also provided us a pilot to go to Conewango, through an uninhabited wood except by a
few families, in the afternoon we set forward with our pilot and reached the House of James Tite[a?]s on the fertile banks of Oil Creek where we
were kindly entertained without money or price, here we put bells on our Horses and let them run loose in the woods, the Man of the Hous informed
us that he had gathered three Barrells of Oil in one year off the Waters of Oil Creek, and  sold it at the rate of four Dollars per Gallon it being
an excellent medicine, a few rods from the House was a stream of water which appeared large enough to turn a Saw-mill the Man of the House informed
us that it proceeded from one Spring about 20 rods above 15th of the Month set forward through the Woods, and followed the course by marked trees,
which our pilot had done the Summer before, we found the way worse this Day than any we had hitherto met with, some places very hilly and a
multitude of trees and old Logs lying in the way, which made it very difficult getting along, other places the Ground being pared with the roots of
large trees with many cavities between them, and overgrown with moss which made it very dangerous crossing, in the evening we arived at the House
of James Justice on the Waters of Brokenstraw where we lodged that night on the floor by the fire as we did the night before 16th of the Month
about noon reached the the mouth of Conewango Creek where a Town is laid out on a piece of Land belonging to the State of Pennsylvania at this
place we met with a company of Indians some of whom were much intoxicated and appeared miserably dirty and frightfull, having large loops cut in
their Ears and chunks of lead hanging to them to stretch them down, here we stayed all night it being the end of our pilots journey and about 60
Miles from Ft. Franklin, 17 of the Month employed one of the aforsaid Indians to pilot us to Cornplanters Village about 15 Miles, found the road
extremely difficult on account of old longs and trees lying down, about 2 o clock in the afternoon we arrived at Genusshadega where we were
surrounded by a company of Indians who in a friendly manner came and shook hands and appeared to give us a hearty welcome, amongst whom was
Cornplanter the principal Chief, who in a friendly manner conducted us to his House where we informed him that we were Quakers and had come a great
distance to see the Indians, he made answer and said he had heard of our coming and that he was glad and thankful to the Great Spirit for our safe
 arrival and preservation on the way After we had unsadled our horses & sat down in the House Cornplanter asked us if we could eat in his way
(being pretty hungry) one of our company answered he thought we could the old Man then ordered some Victuals to be brought which I suppose was the
best the House could afford, but not being accustomed to their sort of diet and cooking, we made a small portion serve at that time, after we had
done eating we informed him something of our business and that we desired to have his People collected together in Council, to which he replyed he
was willing and left it to ourselves to propose a time, accordingly the next Day was agreed on at ten o clock, and runners dispatched to notify the
Indians under Cornplanters superintendance, in the evening the Old Man brought his Wife and Children into the apartment where we were and
introduced them to us in a becoming manner, after conversing a short time his Wife got up in a friendly manner and shook hands with us & quitty
departed into the other end of the House where the family  mostly lived; in the evening they brought us some milk which with the addition of our
small stock of provision made us a good supper, our lodging was on births on each side of the House raised about a foot above the Ground, and
overspread with Deer Skins on which we spread our Blankets and rested pretty comfortably for the first Night in an Indian Cabin 18 of the Month
took a more extensive view of the Village and the land about it, the Land appears to be very fertile, being a large flat on the West side of the
River of about 300 Acres inclosed with a fence, the most of which has been cleared (I suppose by the Women) about midway of this enclosure stands
the body of the Village which contains about 30 or 40 Houses being from ten to thirty feet in length mostly built about six feet high and covered
with bark, along each side are generally two births the upper one about five feet high on which they throw their lumber and houshold furniture the
lower one is their place of lodging which also answers the purpose of seats to sit on being about one foot from the Ground. the fire they have in
the center of the House  and a hole in the top of the roof for the ascension of the Smoke their Houses, are generally very open and cold in the
Winter season and I believe they seldom use more than two Deer skins and two or three Blankets to bed and often not so much This morning
Cornplanter and his son Henry came into our apartment and desired to hear what we had to communicate to the Council: one of our company informed
them that we were not ready to tell all that we expected to say when the Council met and that we believed it right to wait for the Good Spirit to
influence our Hearts before we spoke in Council but that we were willing to read them a Letter that we had from our friends in Philadelphia and
another from General James Wilkinson in Pittsburg which was accordingly done and interpreted by Henry to his Father; About eleven o clock they
blew a horn and the people came in about about 40 in number among whom was their principal Men and Chief Warriors many of them were frightfully
painted Black & Red their Ears cut in great loops with silver or  chunks of led hanging to them to stretch them down, They had a multitude of
broaches, jewels and Breastplates of Silver about their bodies which with their belts and straps curiously interwoven with beads and their fine
Mocasons made a splendid appearance to one not acquainted with Indians; we sat down at one end of the House I trust with our minds humblingly
exercised under the weight of the concern in which we were engaged and some of the Indians sat pretty quiet, yet the greatest number of them
manifested much lightness by talking and laughing, after siting a short time Cornplanter got up (Henry being interpreter) and spoke nearly as
follows Brothers when I saw you come out of the bushes yesterday I was rejoiced that you were come to see your Indian Brothers, I thank the Great
Spirit for your safe arrival and that you were preserved on the way - yesterday you told us that you had some talk for us and desired that your
Indian Brothers might be collected to hear you speak, some of our Men are hear but our Women could not come but we will tell them your  talk when
we go home, Brothers you see we are poor and have bad Houses covered with bark and we cant build them better We are now ready to hear your talk
after a short time of silence we informed them of the motives of our coming amongst them and a little explained the nature of our business, then
read our Certificate which is as follows To Cornplanter with the chief Men and others of the Seneca Tribe of Indians Brothers It has pleased the
Great Spirit above to dispose the Hearts of the Rulers in the United States and of your people, to live in Peace and Friendship and no longer to
hurt and destroy each other -- this hath long been the earnest desire of the Children of Onas your Brethren the people called Quakers -- The path
between you and them is now plain and open, so that the good will and friendship which subsisted between your fathers & ours may be renewed and
strengthened Brothers  Your Friends the Quakers have fro many years been desirous you should be taught in the ways of hood and honest white, that

subjected by your old habit and manner of living Brothers some of your Counsellors and chief Men have told us that you desired to follow our
advice, and requested our assistance in those good ways we should recommend to you for your present & lasting benefit- now Brothers we have been
very thoughtfull on your account desering to counsel you wisely in all things and that you & your children might hearken diligenly to our lasts and
lock it up in your hearts so that you may often remember Brothers We have waited to feel how the Good Spirit might lead and direct our mind in
those things in which we may be helpful to you , and in waiting for right counsel we have found much good will toward you, and desires for your
wellfare to prevail in the hearts of many amongst us, and some of our young Men from an earnest desire to be useful to you, have concluded to
leave their usual business here and their comfortable dwellings and go into your country for the purpose of instructing you in the cultivation of
your land, raisin & managing of cattle and to escample you in sobriety and industry, for which purpose they expect to remain for a time amongst you
Brothers  The names of these three young men are Henry Simmons, Joel Swaiyne, & Holliday Jackson, they are true Men and we desire you will receive
them as Brothers, and accept of their kind endeavors for your instruction and help, and with readings do what they may show you to be proper for

peacefully and to avoid all evil speaking and in a particular manner we entreat you to keep from the use of Rum and Strong drink, you know it has

many blessings, and fill your Hearts with peace & comfort Brothers With these young Men we shall send into your country some ploughs and other
useful articles to assist in cultivating your land, which we commit to their care in order that they may shew you the use and benefit of them, that
you may be encouraged to procure for yourselves like necessary tools, and by diligent use of them come to reap the plentiful fruits of Industy,
enjoy with your Families comfortable Dwellings, and look on your fields your cattle, your fruit trees & woods with contentment and pleasure, to
enable and assist you yo accomplish this is the sole end and purpose of our present endeavours. having no desire for any of your lands, your
skins, your furs, or anything that is yours Brothers The hearty desire we feel for your happy improvements in pursuing a quiet peaceful and sober
course of life has made us very thoughtful about the serious undertaking of the aforementioned young Men, so that our minds have been earnestly
turned to look towards some others of our Brethren to accompany them on their being introduced among you, and to join in endeavours to promote
their proceeding in a way most likely to be helpful to you and satisfactory to themselves. and it affords us pleasure to find two friends whom we
esteem and love have expressed a willingness to give themselves up to the service; their Names are Joshua Sharpless and John Peirce, Men well
worthy of the love and regard of our Indian Brothers Above all things Brothers forget not that when you are still and thoughtful there is 
something within you which shows you what is good and what is bad, for this is the Voice of God. Spirit with which you as well as all other people
in the work may be blessed and made to be glad and rejoice if it language be sincerely hearkened to and obeyed  this will make you a happy people:
and with out this all the help that Man can afford you will be of little service, this it is that can preserve you from every thing that is
hurtful and unkind, and make you rich in the midst of Poverty We are your friends & Brethren Philad. June 28 1798 David Bacon Ellis Yarnall John
Parish Nathan Harper Henry Drinker John Biddle John Drinker Peter Barker John Elliott Wm Gregory Thomas Fisher Thomas Wister Thomas Stewwardson After
the foregoing and Jas Wilkinsons address was read and interpreted to them they retired into another appartment to consult on the proposials we had
made to them  and said they would reply to what we had said next day; In the evening Cornplanter came and asked us divers questions relative to
our qualifications for work if any of us were carpenters, to which we gave them such information as they wanted and told them we had a set of
carpenter tools and a number of farming utencils coming in a Boat which was intended for the use of the Indians 19 of the month they spent the most
of this day in Council among themselves, frequently sending one to ask us questions relative to our business in the evening about 30 of them came
into the appartment where we were in order to reply to what we had said to them yesterday and Cornplanter got up and spoke on behalf of the people
nearly as follows- Brothers the Quakers listen now to what I am going to say to you. you know Brothers the Red people are poor they are not like the
White People, the great, Spirit has made them of another language so that it is very hard for us to understand one another plainly, as there is no
person here that can interpret very well- Brothers we take great pains to settle the  proposials you made to us but we differ in opinions and we
must take great pains to have every thing complete. Brothers we suppose the reason you came here was to help poor Indians, some way or other, and
you wish the Chiefs to tell their warriors not to go on as bad as they have done; and you wish us to take up work like the White People. Now
Brothers some of our sober Men will take up work and do as you say, and if they do well then will your young Men stay longer, but some others will
not mind what you say. Brothers we cant say a word against you it is the best way to call Quaker Brothers you never wished our lands therefore we
are determined to try to learn your ways; and there young Men may stay here two years to try, by that line we shall know if Morris will leave us
any land and whether he will pay us our Money; for last summer we sold our Land and we dont know yet whether he shall get our money, but by that
time we shall know, and then if  the young Men likes it and we like it they may stay longer. Brothers if your young men stay here we want them to
learn our young men to read and write Brothers two of you are a going home again if they hear any thing about our land or our money they must write
to these young men have and they must tell us if we are like to cheated After Complanter had closed the foregoing speech we informed them that we
were satisfied with what they had said; and proposed to them that they should let us have a good piece of land to work in order to set them an
example and to raise bread for ourselves to eat but that the land should still be theirs, and all the improvements we had on it would also be
theirs when we left it; and in order to know where would be best for us to settle we told them we must look about their Land and go to the other
village and see the Land there, and desired that some of their Chiefs would go with us and show us their land all which they readily agreed to; we
also informed them that the carpenters tools  and farming utensils that were coming forward were intended to lend to our Indian Brothers and that
they should be under the care and notice of our young friends while they staid here, for they knew that some of their young Men were not quite as
good as they should be and if these things were divided amongst them some of them might pawn them away for Whisky, and then they would be as bad
off as they were before they go there to this information some of the old Men expression their way a hearty approbation, and some of the young Men
manifested a sensibility of its perinanaby a shamefaced good humoured laugh After the above observations had taken plave cornplanter expressed
that as matters ware now settled we wouold shake hands as Brothers, and directed his people to come to us himself first setting them an example
thus the councel ended late in the evening. 20 of the Month and first of the weeks above nine O clock Cornplanter came into our apartment and said we
must not think  hard of theirs for not keeping that days we told them we did not think hard of it, but we mostly kepy that day to wait upon the
good Spirit, and about ten o clock that day we expected to sit down in silence for that service, and if any of them had a mind to come and sit with
us we would be well satisfied and desired that we might not be interrupted, at the hour appoined we sat down in our appartment and were
accompanied by cornplanter and several other Indians who sat pretty still and quiet a part of the time and then all withdrew except cornplanter
who conducted himself is a becoming manner throughout the opportunity. 21 of the month made preperations to go about nine miles up the river to see
where would be the most eligible place to settle that we might be of the most advantage to the Nation in general this land being cornplanters
private property of about 600 acres which was given to him by the state of Pennsylvania, and we thought it not best to settle on his land,
accordngly cornplanter, his son Henry, and there other Indians went with  us in a Canoe to Genesinguhta an old Indian Village in the State of
Newyork about 4 miles above the Pennsylvania line where we explored the Land and found a place which we thought most eligible to make the
settlement near a young Chiefs House whose name is John, this man Cornplanter said was like ourselves for he would drink no whisky, and that he was
glad we were going to settle so near him, after spending some time at the House of our intended Neighbour we returned again in a canoe to
Genisatego where we at that time made our home 22 of the Month Cornplanter presented us with some Corn, Potatoes, Beans and a variety of Vine seed
which he said was a collection brought in by his People as a blessing to us in our undertaking, which we thankfully accepted, believing they had
Hearts of good will towards us and our present undertaking 23rd went again to Genesinguhta with all our affects and bought a House of an Indian
woman for 20 Dollars which was  on the spot of Land that we intended to improve, after we had paid the Woman for the house we assisted her in
carrying her goods to another so we took possession after clearing the Cabbin of some of the filth that is mostly to be seen in Indians Houses 24th
made a begining at grubbing which business I had never done before there appears to be a great deal of it to do before the Ground will be ready for
the Plough and a multitude of old Logs to remove out of the way 27th of the month and first of the week had a meeting in our little Cabin which was
a very satisfactory one to me, and elderly friends being favoured to drop some suitable hints of caution and admonition before us which I believe
was well adapted to the state of our minds 28 we attended another council with the Indians, after setting a short time in silence Cornplanter got
up to open the Council and said, Brothers I am very glad to see you all well, any People are also well, many of them are here but  some of them
are gone a hunting, We are now ready to hear you speak: One of our company then informed them that we had some further proposals to make them
which we had commited to writing in order to help our memories which was read and interpreted to them as follows- To Cornplanter and all our Indian
Bro thers of the Seneca Nation now living on the Allegany River- Brothers we have now been several Days among you, and have had Councils with
your Chiefs and wise men, and we have looked about your Country and agreed upon a place for our young Men to begin on, and we are glad and
thankful to the Great Spirit that every thing we have proposed for your good has been so agreeable to your minds, that we seem to agree together
like Brothers having but one mind in every thing we do; and we hope Brothers we shall continue to be of one mind about all the things which we
have been speaking to you of Brothers you know the place we have chosen for our young Men to settle on up at Genesinguhta and we hope some of your
sober young Men will settle by ours and fence off lots for themselves as they see our young Men fence of theirs, and our young Men will be willing
to instruct and assist them a little about working their lots, now Brothers we think our young Friends will not be able to reuse anymore grain
this year on their lot than what they will want to live upon; but we are in hopes another year they will have a little to spare and we are willing
they should give to your old People that cannot work for themselves one Bushall out of four of all the grain &c. they have to spare, the rest they
must have to buy Salt and other things which they cannot raise off the ground Brothers, In order to encourage you still more to take up work and
follow those good ways which we pointed out to you; we will agree to help you a little more- Brothers We will send you a Smiths  tools when our
young men shall write us word and you stand in need of them Brothers If you are industrious this Summer and raise a good deal of Corn and some
Wheat we will help you build a Grist mill next Summer if a suitable place can be found for it, you must find half the Money to build this Mill and
we will find the other half, and we hope Brothers you will save some of the Money you get from the white people between now and that time so that
you may have your share ready again at next summer, and we think you had better choose one of your Chiefs to keep this Money for you till the time
is is wanted or perhaps it will be all gone for whisky or something that won't do you so much good as a Mill would- Brothers We are also willing to
encourage you to take up work, and learn farming by agreeing to give some small premiums to such of our Indian brothers who are industrious and
raise a good deal of Grain Brothers we will give to every Indian Man living on this River who shall raise 25 Bushalls of wheat or rye in one year
on his own Land not worked by white people the sum of two Dollars 2 For every 50 Bushalls of Indian Corn rai sed by any one Indian Man in like
manner affor said the sum of two Dollars 3 For every 50 Bushalls of Potatoes raised by any one Indian Man in like manner affor said the sum of two
Dollars 4 For every two tons of hay raised as affor said and put into a Stack or Barn not being mawed or drawn in by white People the sum of two
Dollars 5 For every 12 yards of linnen Cloth made by any Indian Woman out of flx raised on her own or her husbands Land andspun in her own House
the sum of two Dollars to be paid to the Woman 6 For every 12 yards of woolen Cloth or lincey made by any any Indian Woman out of wool of her own
or her husbands Sheep and spun in her own House the sum of two Dollars to be paid to the Woman Brothers We will give you these premiums for Four
years from this time if our young Men should stay so long, and upon these conditions, that the person who applies for the premium must produce a
Certificate from two of the Chiefs certifying the quantity of Grains, Cloth &c. for which the premium is demanded and that it was raised or made in
the manner above mentioned, and that the person so applying has not been intoxicated with strong Drinks at least for the term of six Months before
such application; And our Friends Henry Simmons Joel Swayne & Halliday Jackson are hereby authorized and desired to pay the above mentioned
premiums agreeable to what is herein before expressed- 5 mo 22nd 1798 Joshua Sharpless John Pierce Henry Simmons Joel Swayne Halliday Jackson
After the foregoing was read the Indians retired into a private apartment in order to consult each others minds that they might  reply to what we
had said, and returned again in about half and hour and made the following reply Brothers We now hear all what you wish to do among us, you are
come here to see us brothers, you wish us well, you wish us to become as the White People, the White are rich and have every thing, the Indians are
poor and have nothing, Brothers you told us one thing, it would be good for us to build a Mill, we will consult Captain Chapen, if he thinks we
will get our Money, and we are able to raise the money you propose then we will do it Brothers We know how far you have come to see us, it is a
great ways to the Sea shore where our fore Fathers once lived, the White People have cheated us and got our Land from us, and now we have but
little left, and we will try to learn your way- Brothers you know there is some bad People among us, and you know we have been cheated and that
makes us bad, and our minds uneasy, if we had not been cheated we should have been very rich People, and had plenty of every  thing, and then our
minds would have been easy and we could think on the Great Spirit Brothers the reason I mention to you about being cheated, some of my Warriors
won't mind what I say to them, but will have their own way, because they know I have often been cheated by the White People, if I had never been
cheated then my warriors would believe me and mind what I say to them, but now they won't mind Brothers we can't all go to work at once some of my
warriors will go a hunting to get provisions and sometimes they broke a Gun and then it takes a great deal of Money to buy another, and we have
very few Hoes & Axes and such things among us and we are not able to get them Brothers I will go along with you to Canadarque and then we will get
matters settled about the Mill and bring it back to your young men in Writing Brothers this is all I have to say we will now shake hands At the
close of the foregoing speech our friends exprest a few words, representing among  after things the unreasonableness of their present practice in
suffering their Women to work all Day in the fields & Woods with their Hoes & Axes whilst they themselves were at the same time playing with their
Bows & Arrows In order for their advancement into the good ways and methods of White People, they were recom mended to take their boys to work with
their mothers and Sisters whilst they were young, and when they grew older they would not think so hard of it, Endeavours were also used seriously
to impress on their minds the remembrance that it was from the Good Spirit they received every good thing, and that he could hear every thing they
said, and see every thing they did; and if they were good and industrious he would love them and bless them with many good things After we had
one speaking and informed them we had said all that we had to say at that time, Cornplanter observed that as all thing are done and settled we will
cover the Council fire, the Council ended to pretty good satisfaction both to us and the Indians tho' a loss was sensibly felt by us for want of a
good Interpreter 30 of 5th Mo While we were sitting in religious retirement (which we continued to do twice a week) we were interrupted by our
Boatman who had arrived at the landing with our goods which relieved us of some anxiety of mind as the River was geting low and we were doubtful
of the Boat geting this far at all, the Boat was 16 Days coming from Pittsburgh to this place which after a stay of about 2 hours returned
homewards, the arrival of our Boat afforded us a plentiful stock of provisions Beding and utensils of various kinds to work and instruct the
natives with, I now feel myself in a good degree happy and contented 7th of 6th mo. This morning being the time appointed for our friends departure
toward their native Land having a wilderness journey before them and but little prospect of reaching home in less than 5 or 6 weeks intending to go
a few days journey over Niagara River in upper Canada thence by way of Oneida and New York which would make their route near 1200 miles, our
neighbour Indian John came this morning according to appointment to pilot our friends to Cataraugus about 45 miles from this place, our friends
being in readiness solemnly took leave of us and set forward  on their Journey having a very rough and disagreeable road as far as Cataraugus 11th
of the month we were visited by Cornplanter and several other Indians being on their way to Canadarque in order to settle matters about the Land
they sold last fall, by whom we wrote to our former companions which they expected to meet at Canadarque 20th of the Month received a letter from
John Pierce and Joshua Sharpless by the return of our neighbour John, informing that they had an affectionate parting with Cornplanter at Buffalo
Creek who was pressingly solicitous that they should stay until the Council met but at length gave it up and in their parting conference
Cornplanter feelingly expressed that he hoped they would make their mind perfectly easy about their young Men, for altho he could not answer for
sickness or Death on such things, but as for anything else he would look upon it his duty always to be their friend and that they might depend upon
him as such, and that no harm should happen to them from his People, he concluded his spech with desiring the Great Spirit might preserve them on
their journey, and that he might so order  things that they might find their families and people well when they got home We are now settled and got
to work at the old and almost deserted Village Genesinguhta which is so overgrown with rubbish & bushes as to cause a great deal of labour to
prepare it for the Plaugh which we started a few Days ago and have planted a small piece of Corn and also some Vine and garden Seeds, The Indians
are dayly flocking about us and manifest much kindness and respect after bringing us Vennison & fish of an excelent quality, to the Women we often
impart small presents which came for that purpose from friends in Philadelphia for which they returned many thanks The dress of the Indian men in
warm wea ther consists of a short Calico shirt or frock which comes a little below the waist over which the ware a fine broad Cloth coat of a
lively coulor mostly Blue or green instead of pantaloons they wear a piece of fine cloth, their leggens are mostly blue or green, and some times
superfluously decorated with small beads and curious straps about their legs, their moccasons are curiously wrought with ribbands  porcupine
quills, and small beads, they are latterly getting much in the practice of wearing hats, The dress of the Woman is much like that of the Men save a
short woollen petticoat and a broadcloth wrapper instead of a coat. The Women about us have a number of corn patches interspreed through the
bushes which they tend with their hoes, they plant the hills about 3 feet apart with 8 or 10 stalks in a hill, their activity in hilling and
weeding it is somewhat extraordinary 27th of Sixth month Cornplanter being at our House we enquired of him if he would sell us some boards to build
a House he replyed that we might have as many as we wanted at two Dollars per hundred and he would deliver them at at our landing, a few days after
he sent for us to come to the Saw mill and see the boards measured out, we immediately went and found Cornplanter and several other Indians at
the Mill. here we had a pretty stricking instance of the generosity of Cornplanter, for as we had told the Indians in council at our first coming 
amongst them, that we came not to trade with them, nor to use any endeavours to to get their land or skins, therefore he said he would take no pay
of us for any thing we got from him, but that we might have as many boards as we wanted without pay, we got 1000 feet and acknowleged the old Mans
kindness and offered him the Money which he refused taking as pay for the boards but as he was in need said he would borrow it until he received
his annuity from government, and then he would return it again, which he did accordingly 7th of seventh month Cornplanter and one of our neighbour
being at our house, the latter having a short time before erected a sign on the bank of the river at his new house with an intention of keeping a
tavern, which was a verry disagreeable circumstance to us, yet caution was requisite least we should give offence We however manifested our
disaprobation to to such a practice, in the presence of neighbors John and Cornplanter, the old chief then informed us that we must not be
frightened at it and he would try to have matters so ordered that  no liquor should be kept for sale near us but still they must keep a little to
use at times of hard labour for some times they worked very hard and then a little was necessary, Neighbour John said that he could not loose what
liquor he had on hands for it cost him a great deal of money, but when that was all sold he gave expectations of declining the practice, a few
Days after he cut down his new sign and told us it was tooscoss, which in their language is, not good 9th of the month After quiting work in the
evening I and one of my companions went to one of our near neighbours who had several hand engaged in building a House some were a little
intoxicated, my companions said to one of them who seemed awkward at his words that he drunk too much Whisky which the Indian understood and
immediately his countenance changed and looked horrible he muttered somthing to himself we did not understand we then withdrew from the place,
when we had got a few steps from the House he he took up his axe as tho he had a mind to follow us, but did not, we expected to  have been
troubled with drunken Indians that night but they came no nearer than than their Cabins which were a few rods from ours. This was almost the first
striking instance of the bad effects of Spirituous liquors that we had seen in our neighbourhood. A few weeks after the Indian brought a large
fish and gave to my companion and shook hands with him as a token of friendship, and appeared convicted for his misconduct 2nd of 9th month A young
Man namedBenjamin Shaw who had been employed in clearing Land near the waters of Oswaya Creek about 60 miles from this place having occasion to
return home which was in the Genesee near Bath, about 50 miles from his employment, and on his way thro, the woods crossed his path and bewildered
and after traviling six Days arrived at our house and enquired if we could tell him where he was said he had lain in the woods 6 nights by himself,
and 4 of them without fire and the last night the wolves killed a deer a few rods from him as he was laying without  fire, he fortunately had with
him a little sugar and Cheese on which he subsisted, we let him have some provisions and informed him his right course homeward 8th of the month
Arrived at our House Joseph Ellicott head surveyor for the Holland company, Jasper Parrish States interpreter, Farmers Brother the chief Sachom of
the Seneca Indians, and a large company of Surveyors being on their way to Cornplanters in order to have matters agreed on repecting the Indians
reservation on this River, the evening being wet they stayed with us all night which gave us an opportunity of a short conference with the Farmers
Brother in which we informed him of our motives in coming amongst these Indians, and had our Certificate explained to him by Jasper Parrish, the
old Chief appeared to be pretty well satisfied with our proceedings and said "he was glad to hear of our coming among these Indians, and was in
hopes we would be of use to them, and was glad at this time to see us and have the opportunity of conversing with us,  and said he had somthing to
tell us, which was, that we had an arduous task before us and must have many hardships to pass through in the undertaking, he also thought that
the Indians could not easily be brought off from their old habits and customs of living, and that the natural disposition in them would be hard
to change and altho' he observed that many of them were very active and with a little instruction might learn to work well yet they wanted tools
to work with And as to teaching their Children to read and write it was almost impossible unless they understood the English language yet he
hoped we would be useful to them and the tools we brought would be a great help toward geting them to work And that him and his people would wait
to see what progress these Indians would make in the way of farming, and would be glad to hear of our success in the business, and hoped we would
faithfully discharge our duty and often caution the young Men to sobriety  and against the use of strong Drink We informed him that we were glad
to see him and that he used so much freedom in telling us his mind, that we expected bfore we came to have many hardships to pass through &
therefore were prepared for them, but we had found things much easier than we expected. That the Indians were very kind to us and as to their
learning to work we thought there was encouragement and were of the mind that their Children might be learned to read and write; but we did not
expect a great change would take place very soon but were willing to wait until the Indians saw the advantage of a civilized life Next day they
proceeded on to Cornplanters Village where a large council was held & all matters agreed on respecting the Indians reservation- A statement of
which out of R Morris's purchases as follows Conewangus - 2 square miles Big Tree - 2 square miles Little birds town - 2 square miles Squawky hill -
2 square miles Gardo - 4 square miles Canideer - 16 square miles Allegany - 42 square miles Cataraugus 42 square miles Buffalo and Tonewante - 200
square miles 24th of the month Henry Obeal and several Indians called at our house with whom we had some conversation, respecting their going to
work and geting a living by their industry, one of them said that some birds had lately come about and told them that we intended to go home next
Summer and some others were coming to take our place. We told them we had not yet concluded how long we would stay amongst them, but when we went
away we would let them know our reasons for going, and that it was likely some others would come that would be of as much benefit to them as
ourselves  and that they must not believe all that these fires told them. -- But still they seemed uneasy with their information and said you
have told us what to do and if you go away and some others comes they will tell us another story, then how shall we know which is right: we reply
that the Quakers would all tell them the same story and that they need not be uneasy in that respect.  after the foregoing information they seemed
pretty well reconciled and began to enquire if we had wives and children &c. 1798 21 of 11th mo. About this time Henry Simmons opened a School at
Genisshadego which was atended by several little boys who seemed very anxious to learn the letter and very inquisitive for knowing the english
names of things. Cornplanter bought 50lb. of flower and 100lb. of Pork and some Vennison to accomidate the School-master -- 1799 20 of 1st month
had a visit from H Simmons who informed us of the Death of Cornplanter's Daughter who had been a long time under a consumption, the day of burial a
few men and a great number of Women collected to the house of Cornplanter, the Men assisted in carrying the corps to the grave, after the
internment the men withdrew and the Women returned again to the House where they exhibited a melancholy scene of mourning which lasted several
days, all kinds of the best provisions that they could procure was brought to entertain the mourners 2nd month, first 1799 We received a letter
from T.W. of Philadelphia expressive of a dispensation of more general health in the City than was experienced a few weeks past, but that in the
course of about three Months 3500 of his fellow Citizens were removed from works to rewards, and many had ended their lives in the adjacent
Country We also received one from J. Sharpless our fellow traveler in the commencement of this work, in which he expressed much love and sympathy
with us in our undertaking also some pertinent communication concerning the weighty business in which we were ingaged, a circumstantial account
of the Yearly Meeting and the recent visitation of sickness in Philadelphia and parts adjacent- 19th of the month Some Indian traders called upon
us for lodging, amongst whom was the young War Chief of Catarugus Village, one of the company being a good interpreter we informed the Chief that
one of us had lately passed thro their Village and taken a view of the situation of some of  of their Land and thought it very good, and well
situated for cultivating, to which the chief replyed, that him and his people had it in contemplation for some time past and was very desirous of
being instructed therein, that they had a prospect of building a Sawmill and had come to a conclusion, that every young man should advance a part
of his annuity from Government into the hands of a treasurer until they had enough to build the Mill, that they were very desirous of having some
person amongst them to instruct their children but knew not where to apply, for when the Quakers came amongst the Indians to settle Cornplanter
kept us among his people, and now they saw and heard what we had done here and that made them anxious to go to work, but they wanted some tools to
go on with but ware not able to purchase them; and if they should succeed in building the Saw Mill they would want some instruction how to go on
with it We then informed him of the motives of our society in settling amongst Indians, that our prospect was not from any lucrative views but from
 a desire to be useful to them, and instruct them in the cultivation of their Land, and wanted nothing from them for our trouble. And that our
prospect was not confined to any particular tribe of Indians, but were willing (as much as lay in our power) to assist any that made application to
us, and that we did not wish to go amongst them where the Chiefs and leading Men were not willing to receive us, and the reason we came to
Cornplanter's people was that a general circulatory Letter had been addressed and sent to these Nations of Indians to know if any of them were
desirous of having friends to instruct their Children in the useful habits of good and honest White people, Cornplanter was the only Chief that
consented to receive us and therefore we came amongst his people but that the way was still open for others to make application, and if the Chiefs
and warriors of Cataraugus Village were desirous of having any assistance from our society and would send their minds to us in writing we would
forward it to our friends in Philadelphia, and perhaps some assistance would be given them-  we then asked him if they were desirous of aplying to
our society or to the United States To all which he replyed I am very thankfull of an opportunity of such information there is no people affords
such encouragement as you do. We have often heard from Cornplanters that they had found you punctual to your words in every thing you told them
in the begining, and that they could not find the least fault with you in any one thing. And now I hear you with my own ears and believe what you
say, and am determined to apply to you before any other People in the World and as soon as I return home we will hold a council and send our minds
to you in Writing for you to forward to your Friends, And if any of your People should come amongst us, they shall have Land to settle on where
ever they want it, or anything that is ours that they stand in need of. 16th of 4th month we received the following Letter from the Cataraugus
Indians near Lake Erie- April 11th Cataraugus, To the Allegany Quakers This Day we have met with our brothers as opportunity to return thanks to
our Maker for opportunity to proceed, Our business is to desire our friends to take into consideration we desire to get the knowledge of farming
from our friends as one God made us both, we have advanced ourselves but still think fit to imbrace opportunity, this offer'd us by our friends if
we have any gift that we may have our Eyes opened We first lay our matter before you our friends, as you have come forward and offered to assist
in our undertaking, as there is three Hundred and sixty one souls in this Village that have agreed to receive instruction from you, as we desire
to be instruced in all the various branches of learning letters, pen, and tilling the field; as we have seen great benefit by Captain Obeals, We
desire to be instructed in the same rules Brothers, If you will take into consideration to favour us according to our desire and send such Men as
you think fit to instruct us they shall have House and Land to make themselves comfortable, and shall not be molested by friend nor foe, but be
protected according to the best of our abilities- and Brothers If you conclude to assist us in this time of need and necessity we desire you would
help to a set of Saw mill Irons- We are your friends Ta con on gee Wain tau guh taugh Tenianore & others In this Year of our Lord 1799 10th of 5th
month About this time a number of Indians arrived from Pittsburgh where they had been to dispose of their Skins furs &c. and brought in return a
great quantity of Whisky which they sold to other Indians at home which soon caused much confusion and intoxication amongst the Indians at 
Cornplanters Village insomuch that we felt a disposition (or rather a freedom) to have the Indians generally collected that we might endeavour to
make them sensible of their misconduct and press upon them the bad affects of that pernicious and destructive article, accordingly a time was
agreed on and about 20 of those that were sober attended, where we communicated to them our concern for their wellfare and happiness and also the
many bad affectsthat the use of strong drink produced and solicited them to lay out their Money in future for clothing, farming utensils, domestic
animals, and such like necessary things: and in a short time they might become farmers and have Milk, meat, and Clothing plenty, instead of the
Elk they might knock down the Cow and instead of the Deer they might kill the Sheep, and Swine, which would supply them plentifully with good meat
without exposing themselves to so  much toil and hardships wandering thro' the Snow when it is 2 or 3 feet deep, The Indians sat pretty quiet and
some of them appeared somewhat convicted, they informed us that they would consult each other and others of their people when they get sober and
give us an answer another time. A few Days after the Indians assembled again and made reply to what we had said to them the substance is nearly as
follows We have made enquiry and conversed with each other concerning you, but can find no faith in all your proceedings, but find you just and
upright in all your ways amongst us, and that the fault and bad conduct lies on our own side We wish you to make your minds easy concerning us,
for we intend to take your advice and try to do better. And we are determined not to let any more Whisky be exposed for sale amongst us. We have
appointed the young Chiefs to have the oversight of those that misconduct in future. We will now take up work and assist our Women in the labor of
the field- About this time we received a Letter from our friends in Philadelphia desiring one of us to go to John Wilkins farm at Hickory Town
about 50 miles down this River for a yoke of Oxen which journey fell upon myself, and I employed an Indian lad and embarked in a Canoe with
several others Indians bound for Franklin, and arrived at Hickory Town in about one Day and having had a prospect before I left home of geting a
Milch Cow at this place and not find ing any here for sale, I concluded to extend my enquiries farther and accordingly went on foot as far as
Hickory Town but found none for sale. I then returned again to Hickory Town got a yoke of Oxen and proceeded homewards, the first days travel
found the road very rough and Mountainous and in some places no path to be seen at all. The second day about dark got within 3 or 4 miles of
Cornplanters Town where we were oblidged to lodge in the woods without any provisions or go home in the dark which  would be a very disagreeable
journey, however we concluded to leave the Oxen in the woods and try if we could get to the town, which we did with some difficulty being pretty
tired and hungry, next day the cattle were brought home by some Indians After my return I was for several days engag in the Carpenter-works of a
School House about half a mile from Genisshadego where the Indians propose building a new Town, while I was thus engaged I received information
that agreeable to Cornplanters orders three of his men had taken the life of an Indian Woman, who had been for some time past strongly suspected
by the natives for having the art of witchcraft and was so despised that her husband put her away and took another woman for his wife, (which as
the story goes) so enraged her, that she threatened to take the life of a young child a relation to her former husband. This circumstance very much
agitated the minds of some of the Indians insomuch that Cornplanter ordered three of his men immediately to take her life, she being at that time
at work in the cornfield with a number of other Women who were much alarmed to behold their companion stabed with knives 12 of 9th month arrived
our beloved Friends Joshua Sharpless, Isaac Coates, Thomas Stewardson, and James Cooper, the sight of which was truly pleasing to me as I had not
seen any friends since John Pierce and Joshua Sharpless left us in the sixth month 1798 they brought with them a number of satisfactory letters
from our friends, and relations, during their stay with us they had a council with the Indians, admonishing them to useful habits of industry, and
read to them the following address which they committed to paper at our House Brothers You have now heard that our coming here was to see how you
and our young men who are living among you are getting along. We are glad that the Good Spirit has favoured us to meet you in health and given us
this opportunity of taking you by the hand and brighening the  Chain of friendship. Now Brothers we should like to hear from your own mouths if you
are quite satisfied with our young men living amongst you they came here with an hope of being useful by instructing you in a better way of
managing your Land and providing for yourselves and Cattle, we desire you to speak freely Brothers it has been some satisfaction to us in riding
thro' your Town to see marks of industry taking place, that you are building better and warmer Houses to live in and that so much of your cleared
Land is planted with Corn, Potatoes &c. and to see those articles kept in good order Brothers We observe where your new houses are building that
the timber is very much cut off a rich flat which we wish you encouraged to clear and make it fit for plowing we believe it to be very good Land
for Wheat as well as Corn and as the White People are setting around you the Deer and other game will grow scarcer and more difficult to be taken.
We therefore hope that more of your Men will assist in clearly Land, fencing it,  planting it with corn and sowing it with Wheat. you will then
have a supply of provisions more certain to depend upon than hunting Brothers we were pleased to see your stock of cattle increased. The rich bottom
on the river will yield plenty for them to live on in the Summer Season, but as your winters are long and cold it will require some thing for
them to live on in Winter. Now the white people keep thin cattle on hay, straw and cornfodder, straw you cannot get until you raise wheat or other
grain, the rich bottoms if they ware put in order would produce a great deal of hay, but for an immediate supply, we think as soon as you gather
your corn you should cut the stalks close at the ground bind them in small bundles and put them in stacks as our young men do they would keep the
cattle part of the cold weather Brothers We are pleased to see a a quantity of new fence made this summer near where our young men live  and we
would not have you get discouraged at the labour it takes for if you will clear a little more land every year and fence it you will soon get enough
to raise what Bread you want as well as some for grass to make hay for winter Brothers we understand you are desirous to discourage whisky from
being brought among you with which we are much pleased and should be glad if you would entirely keep it away, for to get it you give your money
which you should have to buy clothes with and to buy Oxen and ploughs with to work your land, and it does not do you any good After the foregoing
writings wore read one of our friends was favoured in a lively manner to communicate some suitable hints of advice to the Natives well adapted to
their present state Before the council ended Cornplanter told our friends that he had made inquiry concerning us, but could not find any fault 
fraud or deception in us at all, but were perfectly satisfied with our being amongst them On the first day following we had a very satisfactory
meeting in our house at Genesinguhta which was a tendering time to me and I believe our little assembly was livingly owned by the true sheperd of
Israel the silent The next day Joshua Sharpless fell through a trap door in a cellar which stunned him, so that he lay for a considerable time
before he came again to his senses, after he had a little recovered we found that he was not very badly wounded, tho we were doubtful of his being
able to travel next day which was the time appo inted for their departure, but they got themselves in readyness (Joshua being anxious for going)
and took an affectionate farewell opportunity with us and set off about noon intending to go about 100 miles to the north into upper Canada in
order to pay a visit to some of the scattering friends in that quarter, they being on a committee appointed by the Yearly meeting for that purpose
7th of 10 mo Henry Simmons took his departure from Genesinguhta and set out for his native land Cornplanter and one of his men accompanying him as
far asCanadarque now were are left but two in number about this time we killed a fat hog and a very fat beef we have a pretty plentiful supply of
Corn and Potatoes and some buckwheat have this fall erected a small log barn and a smith shop and seem to have things pretty plentiful about us
and we now begin to enjoy the fruits of our labour from the field 28th of 12 mo About this time two chiefs came from Cataraughus being on their way
to Cornplanter, Village who delivered us a letter wrote on behalf of the Chiefs of that Village informing that they had received letter that was
wrote and left at Buffalo Creek last fall by Joshua Sharpless &c. which pleased them generally, and that they intended to follow the advice
contained in it for they had already swallowed it in their breath and Hearts that they were going to lay up several hundred  Dollars of their
annuity to buy cattle and other usefull articles, that they ware very anxious to have their friends the Quakers to instruct and assist them in
building a Saw Mill, that they were determined to throw up drinking whisky and if any traders brought it amongst them they would order them off the
ground. We returned them the following answer by the aforesaid Chiefs. To the Chiefs and others of Cataraugus Friends and Brothers We received your
letter in company with one to Captain Obeal and are glad to find that you got a good understanding of what our friends wrote to you at Buffalo
Creek and that the instruction they gave pleased you generally, Now Brothers we did not see that speech that our friends left at Buffalo Creek for
you but as you are determined to take their advice and have already swallowed it down in your breasts we hope you often remember and consider it
Brothers we are glad to hear that you have come to a resolution to lay up so much of your money in order to buy Cattle and other useful articles,
and that you are determined to quit drinking whisky and not to allow any traders to sell it on the ground- Now Brothers this is a very wise
resolution in you and we hope you will be sincere and keep to it, we heartily wish all the Indian tribes would join you in driving Whisky and Rum
out of the Land. We hope some of you have got you Eyes opened to see that Whisky and strong drink has been the cause of much evil and wickedness
amongst you, and that it has taken away much of your money, your skins, and your furs which the Great Spirit has given you to buy blankets,
clothing, axes, hoes, and other useful articles to assist you in tilling the field. And we fear in time past it has taken away some of the corn
your poor Women has worked hard at raising with their hoes Brothers you must know that there are many white people that love money and they know
that you love Whisky and this is  the way they take to get your money and property from you, But if you keep to your resolution not to drink it
then there will be no danger, You will then have money to buy Oxen and ploughs to plow your ground and raise a great deal of corn, and to buy
Axes, and hoes, and other useful articles to go to farming with; And then when your Brothers the Quakers hear that you are trying to do good for
yourselves and making good use of your money it will encourage them to help you more Brothers we want you often to think on the Great Spirit and to
pray to him in your Hearts and then he will show you what is good and what is evil. And we desire you to take up work like the white people, for
your land we believe is very good and will produce a great deal of grain if you are industrious; And when you get plenty of cattle, Swine and Sheep
they will afford you plenty of meat and be much easier taken than the Elk the Deer and  Bear, then will your old men, your wives, and your
children, be happy and enjoy the comforts of life, and you will look on your flocks your fields and your fruit trees with contentment and
pleasure Brothers and Sisters we are young men and can't say a grat deal to you but we intend to send an account how you are coming on to our
elder brethren in Philadelphia and we can assure you that they will be your friends and council you wisely in every thing for your good, and we
hope your ears will always be open to listen to their talk We commend you to the care of the Great Spirit and are your friends and brothers Joel
Swayne Halliday Jackson 8 of the 1st month 1800 Cornplanters sister brought one of her sons to place him with us in order to have him educated in
school learning and brought up like  white children after some consideration we complyed with her request and she left her son with us- 10th of
second month About this time the Indians collect'd together to perform their half years devotion, at which times they are mostly careful to collect
all the Silver tinkling ornaments, and fine apparel that they are master of. I changed to see a broad cloth wrapper that belonged to one of our
neighbour women the lower end of which contained 790 silver broaches which would average at about one shilling a piece exclusive of about 60 dols
worth of silver crosses, the upper end was faced with broad ribones which was computed at about 15 dols price the whole amount of the wrapper was
estimated at 180 Dollars. Yet altho she had abundance of superfluous clothing she lived in a poor little dirty House. I was afterwards informed
that she obtained this property by selling whisky to other Indians,  the Indians continued about 20 Days in their usual mode of worship and dancing
which I shall probably describe at a future time when I may have an opportunity of seeing them 25th of 3rd month By the arrival of T. King from
Philad. we this Day received several Letters from our Relations and friends, amongst which was one from the Committee on Indian affairs which
amongst other things contained the fllowing information viz Various consideration has induced us to believe it right to withdraw our friends from
the Oneida Nation, several of the Indians have been instructed in the best mode of tilling this Land, and two or three young men have acquired so
much knowlage in the Smiths Business as to be able to do what may be wanted in that line for the use of the Nation, so that by a proper
application on their part, they will be assentially benefited by the Labours bestowed on them and that Jonathan Thomas & Jacob Taylor neither of
them felt released from further service amongst the Nations, and that the Committee  expected in a short time they would be willing to come to this
place with a prospect of residing some time among the Allegany Indians 25 of 5th month This morning arrived the above named friends which seemed
to open the way with cleanness for Halliday Jackson to return home as he has for some time had a prospect of being released from his present
engagement. They brought with them several friendly and sympathetic Letters from my Friends at home. 6 mo 8th an express came from Cattanaugus
requesting some of us to assist them in viewing a seat for a Saw Mill, accordingly H. Jackson & J. Taylor went for the purpose and returned again
in six Days informing that they had a satisfactory interview with the Indians, fixed on a place to build the Mill, and were of the mind that there
was a pretty favourable openness for a settlement to be made at that place. a few Days after their return we met the Indians in council at
Cornplanters Village after a certificate of  recomendation for Jacob Taylor & Jonathan Thomas was read, the Indians expressed much satisfaction
with the Quakers being among them and that they thought the Indians and the White People would in a short time be all alike, after the Indians had
done speaking we reminded them of 20 Dollars that they had urged us to accept at the time of the division of their yearly anuity and that we
thought it would be best to add as much to it, as would buy a yoke of oxen for the use of the Town which some of them seemed to consent too with
some reluctance, H Jackson next informed them of his intentions of returning to his native Land and Cornplanter appointed two Indians to
accompany him as far as Cerestown, 55 miles up the River accordingly on 17th of this month he bid adieu to oldGenesinguhta and departed I bore
him company to Cerestown as I had some business there and returned home in four Days having lodged comfortably two nights in the woods, and partook
of a plentiful  supply of venison and fish which the Indians killed by the way An unfortunate circumstance happened among a company of Indians that
was lately hunting on the waters of Beaver and had pitched this tent near a white mans house who kept Whisky to sell which occasioned some
difference between the White Man and one of the Indians the White at length got other ruffians to assist him in taking the lives of the Indians
who were not aprised of their intentions, in order to prosecute their horrid plan they went to the Indians camp with Guns and imediately shot one
of them dead on the spot another seeing what was done immediately attempted to make his escape with a child under each arm but was followed by a
ball which wenet thro' his breast and thro' the shoulder of one of the Children and the wrist of the other; one of the murderers is now secured
in Pittsburgh in order for tryal- 1801 1 mo 25th About this time considerable uneasyness arose in the minds of some of the Indians from being
informed by a  malicious white Man that my motives in coming here was to try to get a mile square of Land from them as I had been here ever since
the settlement was first established for the improvement of the Natives, two Indians came to talk with us on the occasion and we endeavoured to
convince them that the report was intirely groundless and that we did not want any of their Land nor other property for any of our service amongst
them 26th of the month we received informa of the Death of Hyute a young indian man that had been lately married who after about eight days
illness died at his hunting camp in the woods about 17 miles from home. The above information caused me some serious reflections, as he was a
young man in the bloom of life and flower of his Days, and in health just a few days before, I was led to reflect on the uncertainty of our
existance here in this world and how very necessary it is for every one to be prepared at any hour to meet the messenger of Death The death of
Hyute led me to enquire of one of our neighbours how the Indians divided the property of a deceased person. I was informed that it is commonly
divided amongst the brothers and sisters of the deceased. the Wife or Children having no claim thereto, but in former times they buried the
apparrel with the corps and then burned the House with all of its contents 30 of the month 20 or 30 Indians called at our house being on their way
to Genisatego to perform their half years worship and notwithstanding I have never been to see them I will en deavour, to give a brief account of
their proceedings which I had by information. In the first place they are very zealous to have their people generally collected some that are not
able to walk are hauled by two or three of their friends ten or twelve miles on the ice or snow wrapped up in Blankets, buck-skins, when the
necessary preparations are made they place themselves in a circle round a large image which is  erected on a pedestal about six feet high and
having a white Dog skined and dresed they lay him on a hot fire which is previously prepared for the purpose, and while he is consuming one of the
Chiefs on behalf of the people addresses the Great Spirit in thanksgivings for the game they have been permited to take in their hunting hours,
after this is done another Chief takes about half a pound of Tobacco lays it on the fire and addresses the people by way of admonition and
exhortatin During the rendevous they are dressed in their best apparrel and many of them have their faces painted in many frightful wild looking
figures and their heads decorated with feathers painted different colours and beaded belts & Mockasons which altogether forms a very wild ro
mantic appearances to one not acquainted with Indians. They continue their dancing and different manuevers about six or seven Days with an
abundance of rattling and tinkling ornaments about their feet and legs and their clothes decorated with hundreds of silver broaches, breasplates
&c.  on their way home many of them called at our House amongst them was an elderly female Chief with whom we had considerable conversation,
amongst other things she observed that the Indian Women had too great a burden to labour under for the Men would work but little, the Women had to
cut and carry home all the fire wood, plant & raise all the Corn pound it & prepare it for eating, and when it was ready the Men must eat first,
and when the Men killed any Deer the Women had to carry home the meat and what was worse than all the Men often got Drunk and then they would beat
and abuse the Woman and yet they had to bear it all. I was a little pleased with the old Womans remark as many of them do not seem willing their
husbands should work. 4 Mo 27th I set out in company with two Indians in a Canoe loaded with wheat intending to go to Oil Creek Mill about  eighty
miles down the River. but being informed on the way that the Mill was out of repair, I concluded to go to a mill about twenty miles further on the
waters of French Creek, after getting the grinding done set out homeward of the being very rainy and disagreeable traveling: the most of the way
the Indians had the fortune to kill a very large Bear. As he was crossing the River, which afforded us plenty of good meat on the journey. The 6th
of 5 mo We arrived at Cornplanters Village having travelled about 200 miles in the whole rout and lodged five or six nights in the woods on the
banks of the River 7th Mo 18th Received two Letters from friends in Philadelphia one directed to the Seneca Indians of Allegany, the other to the
Munceys at Cattenaugus respecting the late difficulty that subsisted between them on account of supposed witchcraft also two from the Governer of
Pennsylvania directed to the above mentioned Indians on the same subjuect. 8 Mo 4 78) Received letters from my connections in New Garden informing
of a Prospect of a visit this summer of some of the Committee on Indian affairs, also that a young many by occupation a Black smith had given up
to come and spend some time in this settlement which was very satisfactory news to me, 8 mo 17 This being the time agreed on by some of the Indians
to have the Governnors letter explained to them, two of us went to Gineshadago for that purpose where we found the most of the chiefs and a number
of others collected for also an Ancient man who was a very great Speaker belonging to the Onondago Nation, and held in much esteem by the Senecas,
he having received some previous information of the contents of the Governors letter Cornplanter having opened it and had some parts of it
explained before it came to our and seemed somewhat disaffected towards the Governor, and intimated to some of his people that the letter should be
burned before the letters were read the Onondaga Chief spoke a considerable time requesting them to pay attention to the Governors advice said he
thought none of the letters should be destroyed After the aged chief had done speaking the Governors letter and one from Friends in Philadelphia was
read and interpreted to them which very much contradicted their absurd belief in witchcraft which seemed considerably to agitate the mind of
Cornplanter, yet some others appeared to receive it pretty well and appeared to be somewhat ashamed for having before entertained such foolish
notions After the letters directed to the Senecas were read Cornplanter insisted on having those read, which were directed to the Munceys we
informed him that the Governors Letter was sealed and that we did not wish to break it open, but if he had a mind to open it we would read it at
the same time cautioning him against it but the Governor or the Muncys might be displeased Still the old man insisted upon opening the letter and
having it read which was done he afterward signified that it should be burnt for said he, it will do the Muncys more harm than good- another Chief
said he was not of the same mind and he thought it would be best for all the Chiefs to shead their sintiments on the occasion, that it was his
mind that it would be best for the letter to be forwarded to them- it was afterwards agreed that all the letters to both parties should be
explained to all the Seneca Chiefs at Catterangus and Buffaloe, and then the Munceys letter carefully conveyed to them the writing were according
by forwarded by the Onondago Chief how the matter will end is uncertain A few days after Cornplanters Brother Connudiu or Handsome Lake collected a
num ber of Indians and told them he had lately needed instructions from Heaven by three men whom he stated he had previously seen these men had
told him many things, that the Indians shamed keep up their old practice and manner of claiming for that was right and if they did so the Great
Spirit would send into their woods great plenty of game and cover their ground with a new and rich soil whereby the Indians may live plentifully
without much labor and that it was not right for them to raise wheat and corn to sell to one another but they were right in wearing old and ragged
clothes and in painting their skins and tanning often which was pleasing to the great spirit. These and often such like foolish and supersitious
doctrines and nations tends very much to obstruct the work of civilization being calculated to suit the weak ideas of the natives, and retard our
endeavours for their good - About this time while their minds were in much agitation some of them gas a little displeased with the Quakers being
amazed then and as we were informed came to a conclusion that we should have the plan Henry Obeal, the son of Cornplanter being as far our with us
had a very warm debate with them on the ocassion and told them what we had done for them which served to put a stop to their proceedings. 9 mo 15
This day John Pierce Tho Stewardson and Vincent Wiley arrived at our house, the sight of whoom was truly satisfactory to us particularly to my
self, I having for a considerable time part had a prospect of being released from my present engagement & W being a Blacksmith will now release me
I having had to act in that capacity in many instances although previously acquainted with the  look forward to a return my nation land having
been engaged in the Indian concern upwards of three years 18 of the month being the time appraised to have an interview with the Indians
Cornplanter and several other Chiefs attended and about 20 of their young men and warriors attended also with two of the principal men from
Buffaloe and two from Tonewanto, our friends read a certificate from the committee on Indian affairs which was interpreted to good satisfaction by
Henry Obeal also one for V Wiley who intended stay my someimte amongst them after matters were treated or Friends informed them of the great
satisfaction is afforded them to obey over the inform many of them had made in clearing and farming this land, building houses & the unease of
their cattle since they were among them before, and that they had taken up a resolution to grant drinking whiskey and of her strong drinks it was
a very satisfactory conference 9 Mo 22 Took my departure from Geneshingutla in company with the Cornplanter after a solemn leave of those we left
behind and a number of Indians that collected to witness our departure travelled about 20 miles through the woods having a very rough road and some
rain encompassed about 4 oclock and rested pretty comfortable next morning set forward and found the road find some places upstream by bad until
we came to Cattaraugas kind man which there is abundance of land of the best quality and the most beautiful timber I ever saw chiefly Black Water
and Poplar bar after passing about six miles down the river we came to the Cattaraugus Village and lodged in the house of the Chief Warrior and
was kindly entertained, his wife endeavouring to make us as comfortable as possible 24 Left Catteraugus about one oclock, followed a rough
disagreeable path about 7 miles to Lake Erie which opened to my view a very gratifying and agreeable prospect the beach afforded a very good road 
and abandoned with many curiousities formed by nature and is very instructing to a contemplative mind we rode at the rate of about five miles per
hour, until we came to a stream of water called Cariguaga where we encamped by the side of the lake and represented ourselves and know with
provisions we carried with us, we pushed out tent and had a pretty comfortable night lodging although cattle are frequent in these parts & fed
our horses and took breakfast and set forward on our journey about six o'clock being pleasingly entertained by the curious lands of the Lake which
in some places we thought was 80 or 90 feet perpendicular and interested with different kinds of stone many of the rocks being over and by wrong
by the waves into coves and curls in a fantastic manner about 11 we arrived at Buffaloe Creek which we crossed in a small flat toBuffaloe Village
on the opposite side where we remained till next day having about 80 miles from Genesingatta 27 crossed the Niagara at Fort Erie about one mile
wide and the water run my very rapidly although it was thought to be a very favorable time to cross on account of the wind blowing up the oven
which prevented all high from the lake, after landing in Canada we travelled about 10 miles up the Beach thence one mile inland to a friend from
Jersey where we staid all my were kindly entertained & went about 2 miles to Asa Schooleys where we met with Rowland, Isaac Wilson on Rachel Hunt
Lydia Sharpless and Jane Crosson who were apart of the committee appointed to visit friends in Canada, a meeting was held at B Schooleys house,
where about 40 people attended mostly friend it appeared to be a satisfactory opportunity in the afternoon by William & myself took leave of J
Pierce T Stewardson and other friends present and departed intending to neturn immediately homewards, we lodged that night Danl Pounds 28 set out
for Ng early and rode about 20 miles to the falls of Niagara the greatest Phenomenon and the most gratifying sight I had ever beheld the water
beginning a very rapid descent about three quarters of a mile above the cataract, there is an Island of 10 or fifteen acres just above the
precipice which divides the sheet of water in its fall at one patch of 150 feet, a continual mist arises which may be seen for many miles and it
is thought the roaring of the Cataract may be heard for 20 or 30 miles on a still morning, a short distance above there are erected a Grist mill,
Saw mill, and Forge and excellent seats for that purpose there are 17 saws in one frame which cuts a log in to boards at one through, and would I
should suppose cut 10,000 feet of boards in a day, several other miles are in contemplation at the same place after viewing the falls from the top
we went about half a mile down the river, and descended about 35 feet by an Indian Ladder that was created for the purpose thence down a  very
steep hill to the water and went up to the Cataract when the mist is continually falling, was passed on a little farther until we got within the
edge of the sheet of water, at this time the wind varying a little blew some of the water on us, it was a beautiful yet awful sight, we then
ascended the bank and went on foot to the Chippiway, where we had left our horses, then rode 20 miles to an inn near the outlet of the Lake. heard
the roaring of Niagara very plain 29 Crossed the river and rode about 40 miles the most of the way good roads across an open Country called the
Whitecoke Plains the two last miles being very muddy & deep which we traveled after dark but kept the road without much difficulty 9 mo 30 Left
Davison and travelled to theGenesee River mostly by muddy River the land pretty good, on the east side of the River we found very good roads and
the country pretty by inhabited many elegant dwelling house mostly farm and some of these painted white, the inhabitants living mostly from New
England and are generally remarked for bei a very industrious and enterprising people, the land from Geneseting Canadarque is g
