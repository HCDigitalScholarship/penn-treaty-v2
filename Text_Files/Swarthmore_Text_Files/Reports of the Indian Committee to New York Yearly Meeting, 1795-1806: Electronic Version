 New York The attention of the Meeting was turned towards 
the situation and circumstances of the Indians in the Western 
parts of the States and aconcern took place for the promotion 
of their Welfare and the Subject spreading with weight much 
sympathy was felt with them in their Scatter’d & remote 
situation and under a deliberate view thereof there appeared 
apropiety and hope of usefulness in placeing the Subject under 
the consideration and care of the Meeting for Sufferings who 
on examination into their circumstances are authorised to 
afford them such assistance as may appear necessary to said 
Meeting and the following Friends are appointed to set 
with the Meeting for Sufferings in the consideration thereof

Frost John Caste Thomas Eddy Isaac Legges Joseph Talket William 
& attentive Dan Titus Joseph Griffin Willis Seaman Henry Hull 
Abraham Underhill & Rich. Lawrence & John Ferris Adjourned to the 9th hour on 2d day Morng New York 27th. The Meeting assembled according to adjournment We find by the Minutes of our Meeting for Sufferings that 
the concern of this Meeting relative to the Indians in the Western 
parts of this State had been attended to by that Meeting in Company 
with divers Friends appointed last Year to unite with that Meeting 
on this Subject that their care and attention thereto had induced 
an appointment to visset that People to inform themselves of 
their situation and circumstances that the report of the Committee so 
appointed claimed the attention of that Meeting and impress’d 
a concern for that People that led to aprospect of some further 
steps on their behalf and in an especial manner for the 
discouragement of the Spirituous liqueres being introduced amongst 
them but in attending to the prospect way did not open to 
proceed therein for the presant – The care and labour of that 
Meeting with the Friends who were united with them 
therein appear to have been great and manifests their regard 
to the concern and recommendation of this Meeting and it is 
satisfactory to find by the information now before us that 
many amongst that People have become sensible of the 
sorrowful effects of the use of ardent Spirits, and their openness 
to advice and council, and a renewed weight attending the 
Subject at this time, our deliberations result in the appoint- 
ment of a Committee to the solid Consideration & attention 
to the concern of this Meeting on the Subject and that they 
move forwards with care and caution as way may open 
and thereto the following Friends are appointed viz 
Joseph Cooper , James Mott , Sam Bowne James Parsons Trip

Sufferings is desired to give their advice and assistance of the 
Committee should see occasion to call for it and to call on our 
Treasurer for Money in their favour if the Meeting for Suffergs 
should see it advisable – Adjourned to the 4th hour afternoon – New York A report from the Comm.ee on Indian affairs is now read asolid quiet 
took place thereon and arenewed sympathy felt for that People and 
the further consideration thereof is refer’d to afuture seling the 
report is as follows viz To the Yearly Meeting now seting The 
comm.ee appointed last year of Indian affairs now report that we 
have had in the course of the year past divers Meetings on the 
weighty subject refer’d to us and have at times been drawn into 
sympathy with the peculeir situation of the Natives and while 
deliberating on the best means that might be adopted for 
promoting their welfare if appear’d to the Comm.ee that there would 
be aprobable usefulness in selecting some of our number to pay 
them avissit and some Friends were accordingly named for their 
purpose but circumstances which afterwards took place presented 
them from proceeding on the journey and soon after this the 
advanced season of the year rendered it very difficult to proceed 
so that avissit has not taken place – It would have afforded 
satisfaction to us if we could have possess’d the Yearly Meetg 
with more full information of the State of the Indians which 
mights probably have been done if the intended vissit had been 
made We can only now say that from some information 
obtained anumber of the Indians have lately shewn agreater 
disposition towards sobriety of conduct and agricultural 
improvement that heretofore – And altho’ asufficient attraction 
to this interesting concern will probably require patience and 
perseverance yet under right direction we are induced to 
believe it will lend to the benefit and advantages of the Indians Signed by direction & on behalf of the Comm.ee 5 mo 30. 1797New York by 
Samuel Bowne New York The Meeting gathered at the 2d hour - 
Renewed attention was given to the Subject referr'd 
from last seling relative to Indian Affairs and as we 
find that the Comm.ee had aprospect of asrvice for them 
to perform which they had been prevented from going 
into 'till the season was too far advanced and a desire 
being witness'd for their encouragment in the extention 
of further care this important Subject is therefore continued 
under their care with the following Friends added to them 
in this concern viz Thomas Titus Stephen Rogers - 
Leonard Lawrence & George Bowne - Elias Hicks 
is releas'd from this Service at his request - New York The Committee continued on this Meetings concern relative 
to the Indian Natives in the western parts of this state, make 
the following report in writing viz - New York The Committee appointed by the Yearly Meeting on 
its concern Relative to Indian affairs, report that they have 
so far paid attention thereto that a visit hath been paid by 
some of their number, to the Indians of Brothertown, Stock- 
bridge, Oneida, and part of the Tuscorora Tribes, by whose 
report it appears, that several of these tribes have of latter time 
not only appear'd convinced of the necessity of their becoming 
more acquainted with habits of civilizasion, but have given 
some proofs of industry, and attention to agricultural pur- 
suits, which gave encouragement to hope that by a perse- 
virance therein, they may be enabled to acquire a more 
certain, and comfortable livelihood, tho at present they are 
mostly poor, and in streighned circumstances; and particular 
-lysed, while the Committee were there, by reason on an unfavour 
-able season, the last summer, and a very trying long Winter 
which induced them to afford some of the most necessitous 
some pecuniary assistance, mostly to procure Bread Corn; 
that divers of the Indians appear to be religious sober minded 
persons, and very sensible of the perniceous effects of storng 
drink, and concern'd for their People on that acccount- 
yet others still gave way to that weakness - That they 
found several young Men from Pensylvania Members 
of our Society residing amongst them, from their own concern 
and under the direction of a Committee, of the Yearly 
Meeting of Philadelphia, for the instruction and Improve 
-ment of the Indians; who informed them, that altho they 
met with many discouragements, yet on the whole there is 
an improvement amongst them, that the Indians form a 
desire that their Children, may have some School learning, 
have several Schools amonst them, one of which is taught 
by one of the forementioned Friends; the other by their own 
People; several of the Tribes, express'd the satisfaction they 
had in the visit paid them by our Friends in 1795, signify- 
-ing that it had been useful to them, which appear'd to have 
been the case - The Indians viewed the visit kindly, 
express'd their gratitude for this further attention of care 
and regard for them - That tho the visit was attended 
with some fateague yet they had a good degree of satisfac- 
-tion therein - Sign'd by direction, and on behalf of the Comittee 
John Barron The care and attention manifsted by the Committee, to those 
people is satisfactory to the Meeting; and the comfortable quit 
that 
that attends the present consideration, together with a free com 
munication of concurring sentiments pointing thereto leads to the 
prosperity of an appointment, to continue a care to the subject. 
and in encourageing them to step forward therein, in the way 
that may appear most likely to contribute to the well doing of 
the Indians, and answer the present views of this Meeting, particu 
-larly, in endeavouring to turn their attention to agricultural Im 
-provements, and a state of Civilization, and should a suitable 
Friend or two, from a concern to be useful to those People, be dis- 
posed to step forward in residing among them for a time, in order 
to effect those desireable purposes, that the Committee encourage 
and make way therefor - And as occasion will probably require 
some pecuniary aid, for their and other purposes, the Committee 
with the advice and approbation of our Meeting for Sufferings 
are authoritative to call on their Meetings Treasurer to answer such 
demands, and to the service the following Friends are apointed 
Viz John Barron , Samuel Learing , Charles Frost , Gideon Seaman , 
Samuel Bowne , John Murray , Thomas R Robinson , Peter 
Lossing, Trip Mosher , James Mott , Fiddeman Hull , John 
Barker, Robert Bowne , and Oliver Hull - Adjourn'd to the third Hour tomorrow afternoon New York The Committee appointed to the 
Important concern, appertaining to the welfare of 
the Indians made the following report in writing viz.- New York That during the last year they have several times met 
and the subject of their concern has engaged their attention 
and that one of their number, in company with our friend 
Hugh Judge , has paid a visit to some of the Tribes situate 
in the Oneida Country since last year, to a good degree of 
satisfaction; having reason to believe there is a progressive 
improvement in civilization and agricultural pursuits. - There are a number of Schools established amongst 
them; one of which has been taught by a man friend from 
Pensylvania, who appeared likely to prove useful to that People, 
having course to believe that his undertaking originated 
in aright concern - Another School was also taught 
by a woman friend, whose devotedness and attention 
to this arduous undertaking, gives reason to hope that 
considerable benefit will result from her labours. - 
Yet we observe with concern, that owing to a disposal 
of some of their Land to the State, adjoining to the 
main road, leading through their settlements, which 
 by the introduction of Taverns, opening an easy access 
to the use of ardent Spirits, which has hitherto proved so 
 painfully detrimental to their civil & religious improvement, 
for altho many of them appear sensible of its baneful effects, 
and consider it as their most potent Enemy, yet their 
 weakness is such, through the power of habit, that when 
it is introduced amongst them, they give way - Yet from 
the covering of solemnity, & heart felt sympathy generally 
felt on the first opening of this weighty concern for their 
wellfare, the evident revival of it at times in our deliberations 
on the subject, affords encouragement for friends to persevere 
in their benevolent designs, apprehending it may be 
 ranked amongst those cases, where obstructions ought to 
stimulate to an increase of care & attention - The Meeting in arenewed attention 
to the subject relative to that People, and the communication 
& feelings thereon, evidenced arevival of the concern, & 
 asatisfaction with the report of the Committee - who are 
desired to continue their care, & attention thereto, agreeable 
to the minute made on this subject last year, with 
ahope they may be encouraged to persevere in the work 
under right direction - and as their number is small, 
& reside much scattered, it is throught a usefulness might 
arise from an addition being made to the Committee -
 and the following names being proposed were united 
with, & accordingly appointed to that service viz.& - 
Shadrach Ricketson , Ebenezer Haviland , Benjamin 
Cornwall, Willett Seaman , Thomas Franklin , Hugh 
Judge, Andrew Cock , Thomas Eddy , Browning 
 Wilbor, Zebulon Hoxie , Isaac Leggett & David Haight Adjourned to the 5th hour Afternoon. New York 31st of 5th mo. The Meeting again assembled - The subject relative to the Indians being revived, 
it is thought an advantage would result form endeavour 
to render the concern more diffusive - and aprospect 
opening to spread the consideration thereof in our 
Quarterly Meetings, which being united with, a copy 
of this Minute is accordingly directed to our Quarters. New York The Committee on the concern of this Meeting 
relative to the welfare of the Indians, now made 
the following report on that subject - viz. - New York The Committee appointed by the Yearly 
Meeting on its concern relative to Indian Affairs Report - That during the course of last year, we have frequently 
met, and the subject of our appointment weightily 
claimed our attention, often leading our minds 
into anear sympathy with the natives; and altho 
the exercise presented at times many discouragements, 
yet as we were from time to time made sensible 
that the concern was owned, we were encouraged to 
believe, that as friends attend to the pointings of 
duty, and persevere therein, that they might be very 
useful to this People - In the course of last year 
two of our number, altho not appointed particularly 
to the service, paid avisit to some of the Tribes from 
areligious concern, which was to the satisfaction of 
the friends, and appeared very acceptable to the Indians. 
The Stockbridge Tribe expressed a desire that some 
suitable Person might be sent among them to instruct 
some of their young Men in the Blacksmiths business - 
as if may be difficult to meet with a Friend, suitable 
& free, to reside among them, the Committee turned 
 their attention to endeavour to serve them by procuring 
suitable places, where some of their Youth might be 
placed to get instruction in that Trade, - and as this 
may greatly forward them in civilized life, it is desirable 
that friends generally may aid the Committee in 
 finding places for them - After having made 
some progress in improving the general state of things 
in the settlement in and about Oneida, we find that friends 
of Pensylvania Yearly Meeting have withdrawn their members 
who for sometime resided with the Indians there, with 
aview of extending their services farther westward - 
As those Indians are now left by Friends, who have 
at a considerable expence helped them with Farming 
Utensils, and assissted them in erecting Mills and 
other improvements, their labour may in some degree 
be lost, unless attended by friends of this Yearly Meet.g 
and as those Tribes are much more convenient to us, 
the Committee are desirous they may claim the 
sympathy & attention to friends - all which is 
submitted - signed by direction & on behalf 
of the Committee Saml Bowne 5 mo 26-1800 In attending to the preceding report, 
the Meeting was led to the expression of arenew'd 
feeling towards that injured People, and asatisfaction 
with the attention & proceedings of the Committee - 
and they are encouraged to continue their care and 
solicitude for the promotion of the religious & temporal 
good of that part of the human Race, agreeably to the 
concern of this Meeting as expressed in a Minute on the Subject in 1798. New York 27th of the month friends met agreeable to adjournment The committee on the conern, relative to the Indian Natives, 
produced a report in writing, it obtain'd the deliberate attention of the 
Meeting, and is satisfactory, - by this report it appears, that the prospect 
of friends being useful to those people, is encourageing, as by the informa 
-tion of two friends of the committee, that have made a visit to several 
of the tribes, since last year, they appear, progressing in the knowledge 
of agriculture, and a disposition ot civilisation; the committees conti 
-nued attention to the subject, is requested, and they encouraged to 
step forward, in a way, that may appear most likely to answer the 
views of this Meeting, in promoting the welfare of that people In the attention given to this concern, the meeting was led to 
consider, that in friends endeavouring to be useful to them, some necessa- 
ry expenses are attendant; and a prospect was open'd and united with 
of recommending to the Quarterly Meetings, the opening subscriptions to 
raise a fund for the promotion of so desireable a purpose, and it is 
requested, that the Money raised by voluntary contributions, in the 
Quarters, be by them placed in the hands of the Treasurer to the Com- 
-mittee, and the amount reported next year New York A report in writing was received from the Committee 
on the Indian concern, by which it appears that those friends 
have given attention to the subject, that a visit has been made 
by me of their number since last year to divers of the Indians 
settlements, whose report, together with the accounts received from 
a friend resident amongst the Natives, furnishes encourage- 
ment - and gives reason to believe, that the case of this May 
 towards that People has been useful; the Committee also state 
that as our friends of Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting, have with
-drawn their attention from some of the Tribes, heretofore under 
their care; and extended their views to the westward, they 
find it increasingly incumbent on them, to continue their care 
to those tribes, who have from the early part of this concern more 
immediately claim'd their attention - the information 
contain'd in the Report, appears to afford satisfaction, and 
the Committee are continued to the service, and encouraged to 
attend to the concern, in such way as may appear most 
likely to answer the views of the Meeting, in promoting the 
welfare of these Indians New York 5th day morning 28th the meeting again assembled It appears by the report of the Committee, continued by last Year
-ly Meeting, on its concern relative to the Indian natives, that the 
subject, hath divers times engaged their close attention, and that a visit 
has been perform'd by some of their number, to satisfaction, those People 
 being improveing in agriculture, and School learning, and that there is 
cause to believe, some of their minds, are at times impress'ed with religious 
thoughtfulness; the subject renewedly claim'd, the attention of the Meeting, 
under which, a desire is afresh witness'd, for the religious, and temporal 
welfare, of that part of the human race, the committee are continued to 
the service, and encouraged to move forward in the concern, as may apear 
to them most likely to answer the views of Friends, in promoting the good of 
that People, Richard Mott , Willett Hicks , Adam Mott , Joseph Bird , 
Charles Webb , Leonard Cook , John Grifin Jun.r and Isaac Thorne Jun.r 
are added to the committee; and Charles Frost , is at his request releas'd from 
the appointment. New York The Committee on the Concern of this Meeting relative to the 
Indian situated on the borders of this States, made the following 
Report - To the Yearly Meeting. The Committee on the concern 
relative to the Indians situated on the borders of this State, Report, 
That in the course of their attention to the service much as not been done 
in the course of the present year, although it may be acknowledged, 
the field for exercising our benevolence, and promoting the good of that 
People seems to be more enlarged. - Three of our number have 
visited several of the Tribes, and from accounts communicated by 
 them, as well as from other communications, we are fully impress'd 
with abelief, that there is encouragement for friends to persevere 
in endeavouring to promote the Objects which first engaged the 
attention of the Yearly Meeting - Civilization & Agricultural 
improvements appear gradually progressing, and there are those 
amongst them who appear to have their minds impressed with 
 a degree of religious thoughtfulness; and the Committee conceive 
it right for them to mention, that this appear to be the case in 
 aparticular manner amongst anumber of the Indian Women 
at Stockbridge, who in the course of several visit paid them by 
different friends, seem'd to claim their sympathy & affectionate 
regard, and as they are equally entitled to our assistance as the 
Men, and it may be the means of increasing usefulness to 
both, the Committee suggest to the Meeting, the propriety of 
spreading this concern before the Womens Yearly Meeting - New York 5th month 29th 1804 
Sign'd by direction & on behalf of Committee 
Tho. Franklin Clerk. The foregoing communication rec.d from the Committee 
on this interesting concern, appeared to afford the Meeting, 
not only asatisfaction, but a comfortable prospect, that as 
friends continue to bear in mind the situation of that 
injured People, and of the motives which led to the concern, 
we shall be enabled to persevere therein, & stimulate 
the Committee to move forward as way may open in promoting their welfare. New York The Committee on the concern of this Meeting relative to the Indian 
Natives, more particularly those situated on the Frontiers of this State 
now made the following Report vizs. To the Yearly Meeting - The Committee appointed on the 
concern of the Yearly Meeting relative to the Indians, have had divers 
opportunities of conference thereon during the course of last year, and 
given such attention to the subject as way open'd - Three of the Committee 
appointed to visit that People report - They spent about aWeek among 
the Brothertown, Stockbridge, and Oneida Tribes, and inform, That 
altho in some respects things among them look discouraging, their 
easy access to spirituous Liquors, from the Whites settled around them, 
induces too many to the excessive use thereof, which joined to their 
common habit of Indolence, greatly obstructs the cultivation of their 
Land, and improvement in other respects; yet they found in each 
Nation those that were sober and industrious, and making agreeable 
improvements - That notwithstanding the many difficulties and 
discouragements, they labour under, the Committee thought they were 
making advancement in Agriculture; and that there were among 
them, who are not only sober and industrious, but religiously disposed, 
particularly among the Females, and visits from friends appeared to 
 be very acceptable, and particularly so to this Class, and that on the 
whole they believe, a continuation of care suitably extended towards 
that People, may probably be attended with salutary effects. A communication in Writing from the Brothertown 
Tribe, sign'd by a number of both Sexes, and addressed to this Committee 
hath been received, and we apprehend it proper to subjoin a copy of 
it to this Report, That the Yearly Meeting may have it read should 
friends incline to it. Being impressed with a desire to aid 
and encourage our brethern the Indians to pursue those Things 
which will be promotive of their present & future welfare - the 
committee thought it right to communicate with several of the 
Tribes through the medium of Epistles, which being prepared, 
were accordingly transmitted to the Brothertown, Stockbridge, & 
Oneida Nations - And altho we still feel the concer to be interesting, 
yet it must be acknowledged, the work of Civilization is a gradual 
one, and that a considerable time necessarily must elapse in much 
fruit may be the result of the labour bestowed, yet while there is 
an evidence of the rectitude of the concern, there is reason to hope, 
 Friends may be enabled to facilitate the gradual improvement of the 
Natives to amore civilized State - and that in the issue they will 
have no cause to regret the part they have taken, in order to promote 
their present and future wellbeing Sign'd by direction & on behalf 
of the Committee - Tho. Franklin Clk 
New York 5th month 26 1805. The attention of the Meeting being feelingly & renewedly impressed with 
asolicitude for the welfare of our Indian Brethren, attended with the 
 expression of satisfaction & concurrence with the foregoing Report, a 
 desire and concern was evidenced to prevail, that friends on that 
Committee may be encouraged to persevere in the Work assigned them, 
that so they may be enabled from time to time, to extend such care 
towards that part of the human race, as way may open for it - & 
as it is desireable that the Committee should be furnish'd with the 
means of aiding those People in apecuniary way, as circumstances 
may render it proper & expedient, in order more fully to carry into 
effect the benevolent views of this Meeting, it open'd to aprospect of 
propriety in authorizing the Committee to circulate subscriptions 
among friends in this Yearly Meeting as extensively as they may 
think proper for raising a Fund for that purpose. - It being 
suggested that an addition of a few names to the Committee would 
probably be useful, with which the Meeting concurs, and appoints 
Matthew Franklin , Samuel Mott , of Mamaronik, Abram. J. Underhill 
and Samuel Parsons . Adjourn'd to the 4th hour tomorrow afternoon New York The Committee on the concern of this Meeting relative to divers 
 Tribes of Indians, furnish us with areport on that subject, which 
 was read, and is as follows - viz. To the Yearly Meeting - The Committee on the concern of this Meeting relative to the 
Indian Natives Report - That during the last year we have 
had several conferences together, and have felt our minds 
engaged in sympathy with, and earnest desires for the promotion
 of the civil & religious welfare of that People, so as to engage the 
attention of several of our number, who have visited them, and 
from the report received from them, there appears an openness to 
receive the advice and council of friends - And altho the use 
of spirituous Liquors continues to retard their improvement, 
yet we have reason to believe that anumber of them are guarded 
in that respect, and we think they progress in the Arts of 
civilized life - They give us apleasing account of one School 
 being taught by an Indian at Stockbridge, and another School 
House erecting at the same place - The School at Brotherton 
is kept up, and another School House in erecting - we are encourag'd 
to believe, the care and attention of friends have been useful to 
them - Subscrptions for raising money, agreeable to the direction
of the Yearly Meeting, has been forwarded to friends in the several 
parts of the Yearly Meeting, but we have as yet received but little 
thereon; and the Committee apprehend it may be right for them 
at this time to suggest to the Yearly Meeting, that they continue 
to feel solicitous that a Fund may be raised, so as to encourage 
some suitable friends to go & reside among them, as one principle 
means of promoting their welfare - New York 5th mo 25. 1800 by 
Thomas Franklin Clk The communication now received from the Committee on this 
concern, affords asatisfaction to the Meeting; and altho the work 
of civilization, and promoting the welfare of that poor and injured 
people is a gradual one, and attended with many difficulties, 
yet it is desireable that friends may not be discouraged, in the 
extension of such farther care towards them as way may open for it; 
and from what is felt and expressed in the Meeting, during its 
deliberation on this interesting subject, the Committee are 
requested to give renew'd attention thereto, and avail themselves 
of every prudent means, which may be within their reach, to 
promote the comfort, & good of that People - And as it appears 
 by the report, there has not been much raised during the last 
 Year, in order the better to carry into effect the benevolent views 
of this Meeting, it is proposed that the subject be recommended 
to the attention of our Quarterly Meetings, as the most likely way 
to encourage friends to aliberality equal in some good degree to 
raise a fund for the important purposes contemplated by the 
Committee, (one principal object being to encourage a friend, and 
his family to go, and reside among them) and the Meeting 
appearing to be united with the proposal, it is therefore recommended 
to our Quarterly Meetings, as asubject deserving of the attention of Friends, 
and that Subscriptions be open'd accordingly by our Monthly Meetings, 
and that the Money which may be raised be forwarded to Thomas 
Franklin in New York Treasurer to the Committee - John 
Dean & Joseph Talcott being proposed as additional Members, the 
same is united with, & they accordingly appointed thereto, - and 
Willett Seaman at his request is released from that appointment. Adjourned to the 9th Hour tomorrow Morning.
