for the Western Shore of Maryland and the
adjacent parts of Pennsylvania & Virginia by
adjournments from the to the of the 10 Mo 1795 A weighty concern being opened in this
Meeting respecting the difficulties and distress to which
the Indian Natives of this land are subject—it obtained the
serious attention of Friends, and many observations ware made
on the kindness of their ancestors to ours in the early
settlement of this Country—exciting to a deep consideration
and enquiry whether, under the influence of that exalted
benevolence and good will to men which our holy Prof-
ession requires; any thing, remained for us as a Society
to do, to promote their Welfare, Religious Instruction,
Knowledge of Agriculture and useful Mechanic Arts,
a solemnity and uniting Calm prevailing over the Meeting
the further consideration of it is refered till tomorrow. The Subject of the distressed Indian natives being
again revived, the sentiments of many Brethren expressed,
and a prevailing Sympathy felt, it appears to be the
united sense of this Meeting that it be recommended to
our quarterly and Monthly Meetings to take this
concern into serious consideration and open subscriptions
among our Members for their relief. The encouragement
of School Education Husbandry and the Mechanic
Arts amongst that people, and it appears their
situation demands immediate attention we hope a
spirit of liberality will be manifested and those
who find freedom to subscribe are desired to put their
contributions into the hands of the following Friends
who are now appointed to receive and apply the
same in such manner as will best answer the
benevolent intention carefully guarding against
giving offence to government org.

Indian affairs held at Baltimore 10 Mo 16 1795 the members being generally present some time was
spent in a weighty attention to the subject Elias Ellicott was appointed to receive the several
sums of many subscribed in the Yearly Meeting and also
such sums as may be subscribed in the different Mon-
thly Meetings within the limits of the Yearly Meeting. John Brown and John McKim were appointed a
committee of correspondence. On consideration of a time for the Committee again to
meet it is agreed to be at Pipe Creek in the 5th Mo next at
the tim of Warrington Quarterly Meeting unless it shall
appear to the corresponding Members from Accounts, rec-
eived to be necessary to meet at an earlier period, in which
case they are requested to appoint the most convenient
plase and time for meeting and notify the members
thereof. At a Meeting of the committee
on Indian affairs held at Pipe Creek 22 5 Mo 1796 10 Members being present a letter from the corresponding
Committee on Indian affairs in Philadelphia being
produced was read being as follows. Philad.3rd Mo 22, 1796 
 Dear Friends The Committee under appointment
of our last yearly meeting for promoting the welfare of
the Indian natives have had divers conferences on
that interesting concern, and selected from their
Number a sub. committee of 15 friends to afford a
close attention thereto in the intervals between the
adjourned Meetings of the committee at large
and among other services particularly enjoined on the
said sub committee, they were requested to corres-
pond with such committees of the neighbouring
Yearly Meetings as are or may be appointed
for the like perpose. It is desired that letters and communications on
the subject may be directed to Thomas Wistar 
our Clerk who will on nessary occasions call
a Meeting of the said 15 Friends. They now
conceive it seasonable to furnish you with some
information of their progress and movements in
the business intrusted to their care. The committee at large concluded to address our
quarterly and Monthly Meetings thereon and to
circulate the same in all the particular Meetin-
gs together with the minutes on our Yearly Meeting
and extracts from divers Speeches and Letters of
Indian Chiefs all tending to spread useful information
and draw the attention of our Members to the situ-
ation of these distressed people, which we hope will
have a beneficial effect by exciting in the minds
of Individuals a feeling sympathy with them
and an increasing desire to be helpful in promoting
their civil and religious improvement, several
Sober religious minded persons having already 
signified a willingness to devote their time and to
go and reside amongst them for that purpose We have also written a circular letter to the
different tribes of those called the Six Nations opening
before them the desire we have to assist them in attaining
a more comfortable, quiet and peaceful mode of life
than they have been accustomed to desiring they would
in their councils solidly weigh and concider our proposal
and send us their result as early as may be. Some of us have wa-
ited on the President of the United States and acqua-
inted him with the views of our religious Society in
the exercise of endeavours for the instruction of the
Indians in the cultivation of their Lands and in other
respects tending to their comfort and improvement
 in a more civilized state which he assured us
ware objects he had endeavoured to promote and
ware fully approved by him. The secretary of state who has the Mangement
of all concerns with the Indians, under his particu-
lar care has also been conferred with and manifests a
desire to cooperate with our society in promoting the
welfare of the Indians which will appear or perusing
a copy of his letter to the six nations herewith sent, And we may further inform you that Israel
Chapin, Superindendant of Indian Affairs who
resides at Conadarque in their country and
we have reason to believe has great influence
 among them, being lately in this City, we
 have fully and freely confered with him on
the present concern and had the satisfaction to
find him thoroughly disposed to render his best
Services therein, in which we believe he may
be singularly useful. The distresses and difficulties
which these poor people labour under we believe
may in a great degree be attributed to their pro-
pensity to the use of Spirituous Liquors introduced
among them by Traders and Evil-minded men
who have been in the practice of taking advan-
tage of this weekness and cheating them of their
Skins and Furs, which instead of being applied to
the purchase of Cloathing and necessary articles
are too generally bartered for Rum and Whiskey
and thus through their attachment to this de-
basing and destructive Enjine of Satan, they are left
destitute and miserable, their morals corrupted and
as they come to reflect with coolness their minds are
embittered against the white people. The Committee
have used some endeavours to excite in the minds of our
Rulers a due sense of this envimity desiring they would
devise means for restraining or prohibiting the iniquitous
Traffic. The plea offered by some attempted on the part of
the United States it would avail but little in remedy-
ing the evil while the British Traders from Canada
 deal so largely with the Indians in this article.
We nevertheless hope that a representation to the
British Government & this shewing the gross iniquity
of this reproachful trade, may have a Tendency at least
to check it inpart, if not fully. As in our attention to this concern any thing
shall arrise that may be deemed useful & proper
to communicate we mean to impart the same
desiring like care may rest with you, that what
may occur as useful herein may be intimated to
your loving friends To

Dear Friends The committee of our
yearly meeting having now met at this place
your letter dated the 23 of the 3 Mo last was produced
and read which was satisfactory, as also your
proposal of corresponding with us when subjects
relative to the weighty concern respecting the
Indian Natives offer which we unite with, believing
that a mutual correspondence governed by a deep
attention to the concern bifore us may have its use The subject of our appointment having been
weightily before us it appears to us the most effect-
tual way to get information respecting the Indians
North West of the river Ohio to appoint some of
our number to pay them a visit in consequence thereof
we have appointed five friends to that service 
John Brown Jonathan Wright of Monallan Israel
Janney Moses Dillon & Joseph Bond , and as we
apprehend it may be necessary to have the perm-
ission of Government, therefore request your attention
to that subject and so far as you may think right
to make application and procure what you may
deem necessary and forward as soon as convenient
to our corresponding members John Brown & John
McKim of Baltimore which being the most parti-
cular of our business at this time we conclude
Your friends Signed on behalf of the committee by A letter to the Indians being also produced
and read after due deliberation thereon it was
concured with it being as follows To the Chiefs of the Delawares Shawanese
and such other Nations of Indians as live conveni-
ent to and North west of the River Ohio Brothers
Our friends called Quakers at their
general religious Council in Philadelphia having
agreed to take some of the Six Nations who live in
the North by the hand our religious Council
held last fall in Baltimore were also concerned
for your welfare who reside in the West and told
us to endeavor to speak with you and get ac-
quainted with your Nations for this purpose we
have sent our beloved brothers John Brown Israel
Janney, Jonathan Wright, Moses Dillon & Joseph Bond 
to shake hands with you in your tents and to ask
if you wish to be instructed how to raise Corn
wheat for Bread on your own Lands as we do
and to get meat at home without hunting & to 
take blankets and other cloathing for yourselves
 Children, and also whether you desire to have your
Children taught to read, write and do such other
things as will make you live comfortably under
the Shade of the great tree of Peace. We wish you
speak to us freely with the mouths of your Nati-
ons and if it is agreeable to you we will talk
to you again 
Farewell
Signed on behalf of
Your aforesaid religious Council of the People
called Quakers the 23 of the 5th Mo. 1796 by
 Allen Farquhar Benjamin Walker David Brown Elias Ellicott Calib Kirk On consideration of the Expences likely to attend
the visit to the Indians we think it right that
the treasurer should advance such sum as they
think necessary they to be accountable for the same Then adjourned to meet again at Baltimore at
the 9th hour on first day Morning at the time of
the Yearly Meeting At a Meeting of the committee on Indian Affairs held at
Balt. 10 Mo 1796 The committee appointed to visit the Indians brought
in the following Report,
We of the Committee appointed in the 5 Mon last to
visit some of the Indians tribes NW of the river ohio
have so far attended to the trust reposed in us as to
meet at Beesan Town at which place we were infor-
med that Gov. St. Clair was at Pittsburg but on
further inspection found that he had proceeded down
the river to Cincinnata. We then proceded to the
Mouth of Wheeling where we were informed by Ebenezar
Zane that a number of Chiefs and Hunters had lately
been about the Muskingum river & thought it likely
we could accomplish our business to satisfaction with
them. We accordingly proceded to those parts but they
were gone, particularly the chiefs, some to one place
and some to another so that it appeared impracticable
for us to have them collected in a suitable manner for
a conference. We are however of the mind that if
notice of the intention of Friends was communicated
to them, and they desired to fix on time and place, of
which Friends might have notice, would be the most
likely way to obtain a satisfactory conferrence with
them

The above Committee previous to these proceedings on
the above mentioned Journey were furnished with
permission from Government expressed in Letters
from the secretary of State addressed to gov. St.
Clair and Gen. Wayne , being as follows, Philad.
Department of State May 31st 1796Sir Mr. Henry Drinker of this city whose respe-
table standing among the Society of Friends and as
our fellow citizen you will know has informed me
that a dellegation of five president judicious men
of religious Caracters have been deputed by there
brethren of that Society in Maryland to visit the
Indian Tribes NW of the river Ohio for the purpose
of learning their situation and disposition and thence
to judge of the practicability of introducing among
them the simplest and most useful arts of civil Life
.The result of their enquiries and observations they are
to report on their return to the Society. The approbation of the President has been asked
and obtained. The object of this letter is to communicate
the same to you and to request of you towards the
delegation all the protection & countenance to which
their respectable characters and philanthropic views
entitle them. Most attempts at civilizing the Indians
which I have heard of have been preposterous. We
have aimed at teaching Religion & the Sciences before
we have taught them the simple and essential
labours of civil life. Gov. St. Clair, 
I am very Respectfully
Yr. Mo. Obd. Serv.
Tim Pickering The following report was agreed on To the Yearly Meeting in Baltimore The committee last year, appointed to attend
to the Concern opened and considered in the yearly Meeting
relating to the civilization and improvement of the
situation of the Indians have divers times met and
conferred on the Method most proper to persue in order
To obtain the necessary information respecting the
situation and disposition of those nations who
reside most convenient on the NW of the river Ohio
and believed the way most likely to answer that
purpose would be to appoint some of our number
to go into that Country and open biefor their chiefs
the desire friends had of affording them som assis-
tance in the particulars above mentioned, according
by 5 Wise nominated for that pupose 4 of whom after
being furnished with permission from Government
proceeded to the mouth of Wheeling on the Ohio river
and were there informed by Ebenezer Zane a well
disposed man of good account in that place that a
number of chiefs and hunters had lately been about the
forks of Muskinghum river and that he thought it
likely they could accomplish their business with
them to satisfaction they accordingly proceed agreeably
to this information but found the chiefs dispersed in
different directions and that it was not practicable
to get them convened in a suitable manner for a
general conference—but were of opinion that if notice
of the intention of friends was intimated to the
Indians in a suitable manner and they requested
to fix a time and place of meeting a satisfactory
conference might be obtained as the disposition of
such of them as they had opportunity of conversing
with appeared favourable
The intention of friends being now a little known
amongst the Indians unavoidably also amongst some
other people and the funds to carry any thing of this
kind being yet too small, the business we think will
require attention oftener than would be convenient
for the Yearly Meeting, and are of opinion that
if the care of it was transfered to the meeting for
sufferings it would be useful and that some addition
to our number in this weighty undertaking woud
also be useful all which we submit to the Yearly
Meeting Signed on behalf of the Committee. By
 Evan Thomas John Wilson Balt. 10 Mo 13 1796 N.B. The Stock in our treasurer’s hans in $514 90/100 Then adjourned At a meeting of the Committee on Indian concerns
Held in Baltimore the 15 of the 10 Mo 1796 It appears by a minute of the Yearly Meeting
now produced that the following Friends are added to the
Committee viz.
 Reese Cadwalader Thomas Farquhar Joel Wright James Mendenhall George Ellicott James M Grew and 
desired to proceed in obtaining the necessary information &c Joel Wright is appointed Clerk On a deliberate and weighty attention to the subject
of our appointment we are unitedly of the Judgement
that the present state of the friend is inadequate to
fulfil the benevolent intention of the Yearly Meeting
and feel ourselves streitned?? in proceeding in the business
until it is increased and are therefore induced to
request the necessary attention of friends in each
meeting in forwarding to
Elias Ellicott our Treasurer
the sums already subscribed and endeavor to promote
an increase of the number of Subscriptions in order that
to the reputation of the society we may be enabled to proceed The above was directed to be transcribed and signed
on behalf of the committee and forwarded to the different
Quarterly & Monthly Meetings Then adjourned to meet at Baltimore in
The 2nd Mo next at the close of the Meeting for
Sufferings At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
Concerns held at Baltimore the 4 of the 2nd Mo 1797 present 8 Members After some conference adjourned to meet at
Pipe Creek at the close of the Meeting for sufferings
in the 5th Mo next with liberty for the Members
of the Committee in Baltimore town to call a meeting
sooner if they should believe it necessary At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
concerns held at Pipe Creek the 20th of the Mo 1797 present 9 Members After a weighty conference on the subject of
our appointment Joel Wright having expressed a willin-
ngness with suitable company to undertake a journey
N.W. of the river Ohio for the purpose of furnishing
the committee with more full information respecting
the situation and disposition of the Indians and the
Committee present appearing to approbate the proposal
leave him at liberty to pursue his prospects and direct
him to apply to the treasurer for money to defray
the Expence Then adjourned to the 4th hour on 7th Day
preceeding our next Yearly Meeting At a Meeting of the Committee of Indian
concerns held at Baltimore the 7th of the 10 Mo 1797 present 9 Members The following report was produced & read To the Committee appointed by the Yearly Meeting
Of Maryland on Indian affairs For the purpose of furnishing the Committee
at large with more full & perfect information
respecting the situation and disposition of the Indians
the subscribers undertook a journey N.W. of the river
Ohio we set out from David Greave’s on the west
side of the Monongahila river about 240 miles
from Baltimore and traveled on a mean direction
a little S of W. about 130 miles to the Mouth
of Licking Creek on the W. side of the Muskinghum
river thence near 5 to 80 miles to Chilecothe a town
on the Sciote river, thence up this river near a N.
course 70 miles thence near W. upwards of 30 miles
to the head of Mad river a branch of the great
Miami, thence E. of N. 50 miles to the Upper San-
dusky Town about 40 miles above lake Erie. Then
S.E. 120 miles to the Mouth of Licking creek aforsaid
and thence nearly reversing our former route back. In the course of this journey having visited a
number of Indian Hunting Camps and several of their
Towns we have had large opportunity of discovering
their present situation often exposed to the inclemen-
cy of the Seasons with a very precarious and freq-
uently a scanty supply of food and cloathing &
from the knowledge we have obtained of the
extensive and valuable Country they have lately
given up to the United States and of the narrow
strip of Land yet reserved for their own use between
the line of American Garrisons from Detroit to
the Mouth of Kentucky river we were impressed
with a belief that these who reside in this Country
the Wyandots, Shawanese & Delawares unless they alter
their present mode of living must in a few years
from the scarcity of game be reduced to a state
of extreme want and distress and in order to awaken
their minds to reflection on this subject and open
before them the desire Friends had to afford them
some assistance, by using some endeavours we got
an opportunity with two of the principal Chiefs of
the Wyandot Nation together with several of their
former warriors and young men and having Isaac
Zane for our Interpretor we addressed them nearly
in the following words Brothers 
We are about to speak to you with the
Mouths of a large council of the sons of peace the
Quakers who live on the other side of the great Moun-
tains towards the sun rising. Brothers
We have thought of you we have spoken
of the 16 council fires for you he has given us
liberty to come and speak with you, in your tents
to take you by the hand. Brothers,
You being wise, you can think
what is to come—your land your hunting ground
is getting small, how will you your young
men, your wives and children live when the game
is chased away off the Lands lately given up to the
white people where many of you now hunt Brothers
The sons of peace the Quakers have
taken your brothers the Indians who live near
the great Lakes to the NE. by the hand they
are showing them how to live on little Land,
to raise corn enough for them to eat all the year
to Make Mills to grind their corn to build houses
and make clothes to keep them warm when the
weather is cold to teach their children to read
and write, Brothers
We are not able to make you great
presents but we want to know if you desire to
be instructed in these things—we want to make
for you smooth waters and a clear sky—to show
you how to spread for yourselves on your own
land a large Beaver blanket, that you your
young men, your wives and children may rest easy
under the shade of the great tree of peace, Farewell To which one of the chiefs made the following
reply, Brothers, The head chiefs are very glad
to hear what you have said to them, and thank
you for taking them by the hand, our young
warriors, our woman and children are all glad to
hear what you have said to us, as the great
Spirit above has appointed this day for us to meet, They also assured us they would communicate
our message to their general council and return
a full answer On enquiry we found that the Wyandotts were the
principal nation that every thing of consequence
must be transacted in their council, that they
can transact business by themselves but the Dela-
wares and Shawanese, have to apply to them when
any matter of importance is laid before them, Notwithstanding this information we took an
opportunity of communicating the substance of
the above address to one of two of the principal
chiefs of the Delaware nation at Sandusky, but
our Interpreter an old man of that nation not being
very perfect in the English Language, themselves
of our business, we thought did not seem so clearly
comprehended yet they treated us with civility
and informed us they would return an answer after
it had been laid before their council, Washington county Pennsyl.

 Rees Cadwalader Joel Wright David Greave George Ellicott James Mendenhall & Joel Wright are
appointed to examine the State of the Stock and
prepare a report to the ensuring Yearly Meeting
& produce it to our next siting then adjourned to
3rd day next at the rise of the first sitting of the
Yearly Meeting 10 mo 10 At the time adjourned to 14 of the committee
met and agreed on the following report to the Yearly
Meeting. To the Yearly Meeting now sitting in Balt. For the purpose of obtaining more full & perfect
information respecting the situation & disposition of
the Indians three of our number since last year
undertook a journey N. W. of the River Ohio and
traveled on a S. W. course from the Mouth of Wheeling
on said river about 100 Miles to the Scioto 45
Miles from its mouth thence up said River
near a N. course 70 Miles thence westerly upward of 30
Miles to the head waters of the great Miami of the
Ohio thence N. Easterly 50 Miles to the Upper San
Dusky an Indian Town on the San Dusky River
about 40 Miles above where it emties into lake Erie
thence S. Easterly about 120 Miles to the Muskinghum
River and thence N. Easterly 80 Miles to the Mouth of
Wheeling aforesaid making in the whole a circuit of
more than 500 Miles west of the Ohio, and in the
course of this journey having visited a number of
Indian Hunting Camps and several of their Towns
they had large opportunity of discovering their present
situation often exposed to the inclemmency of the
Seasons with a very precarious and frequently a very
scanty supply of food & Cloathing, and from the know-
ledge they obtained of the extensive & Valuable Country
the Indians have lately disposed of by treaty to the
United States and of the land they have yet reserved for
their own use believe the line which is now run
according to said Treaty and the line of Garrisons
from Detroit to the head of Wabash river which
seperates the land now belonging to the Wyandots
Shawanese & Delawares from that of the Nations
Westerly they were impressed with a belief that those
who reside in this country unless they alter their
present mode of living must in a few years
from the scarcity of game be reduced to a State
of extream want and distress and in order to awaken
the minds of these people to a reflection on this
subject and open before them the desire friends had
to afford them some assistance they had an oppor-
tunity with some of the Chiefs & hunters of the
Wyandot Nations on the great Miami & of the
Delawares at Sandusky and addressed them in a
short Speech of which the following is an extract Brothers
Being wise you can think what is to
come, your land your hunting ground is geting
small, how will you your young men your wives &
children live when the Game is chased away off the
lands lately given up to the white people, where
many of you now hunt Brothers
The sons of Peace the Quakers have
taken your brothers who live near the great Lakes to the
N. E. by the hand they are showing them how to live
on little Land, to raise corn enough for them to eat all
the year to make mills to grind their corn, to build
houses and make clothes to keep them warm when the
weather is could, to teach their children to read and write, Brothers,
We are not able to make you great
presents but we want to know if you desire to be
instructed in these things, To which one of the Chiefs of the wyandotts
replied Brothers
The head chiefs are very glad to
hear what you have said to them and thank you
for taking them by the hand, our young warriors,
our woman and children are all glad to hear what
you have said to us as the great Spirit above has
appointed this day for us to meet. Those Friends also examined the situation of
the country in the neighbourhood of the head waters
of the Miami Scioto and Sandusky rivers and
found most of the land to be of an extraordinary
quality for farming and on the head waters of the
Miami some good situations for mills, Having proceeded thus far pursuant to the
directions of our last Yearly Meeting the committ-
ee feel themselves streitned on account of the present
fund being altogether inadequate for enabling them
to fulfil the benovelent intention of the Yearly Meeting
it appearing to us that a less sum than 2000 dollars
would not answer the purpose for proceeding in
the business on a suitable plan and the sum
now in our Treasurers hands only amounting to about
854 Dollars. Submitted to the Yearly Meeting and
signed on behalf of the committee

 Geo. Ellicott Joel Wright James Mendenhall Then Adjourned. At a Meeting of the Committee at Baltimore the 12th
of the 10 Mo. 1797, present 15 Members. The account
of expences attending the late journey being produced
and admitted, amounts to L 38.6.4 the Treasurer of
the committee is directed to pay it out of the stock now
in his hands, On the consideration of a time to meet
the 4th our an 7th day P.M. preceding the Q. Meeting
at Balt. in the 2 Mo. was proposed and agreed on—
with liberty for the Members of the committee who
live on the West side of the Allegany Mts. if they
should believe it necessary to call a Meeting at Pipe
Creek sooner by notifying the members. Then Adjourned At a meeting of the Committee at Baltimore
in the 2nd Mon , the number being too small to proceed
to procede to business adjourned to meet at Pipe Creek
in the 5th Mon next, At a Meeting of the Committee at Pipe Creek
26th 5 Mon 1798, 6 Members only being present
adjourned to meet at Balt. at the close of the
Meeting for Sufferings in 10 Mon next, At a Meeting of the Committee at Balt. 16th of
10 Mo 1798 Present 17 Members. A letter to a member of the committee
from John Hickewelder Agent for the Moravian
Society to the Indians was produced which being read
appeared to contain an application on behalf of the
Moravian Indians formerly residents on the Muskin-
gum river who having been driven from their hab-
itations in the time of the late war are now
returning and represented to be in want of necessary
implements of husbandry and provisions the subject
appearing to require time time for deliberation the
Committee adjourned to meet at the 7th Hour this evening Pursuant to adjournment 17 of the Committee
met and after some time spent in a solid attention
to the subject opened at last meeting it appears to be
the united sense of the committee present that it
will be right to appoint a few friends to inspect
into the circumstances of those Indians with liberty
if they shall believe is necessary to afford them some
assistance by the furnishing them with such assistance
articles as they may be in immediate want of and report
the state of the business to this committee at a future
Meeting. Rees Cadwalader Nathan Heald and
Joel Wright are now nominated for that Service, Evan Thomas Elias Ellicott and Jonathan Wright 
are appointed to assist the clerk in preparing a reprt
to the Yearly Meeting to contain the purport of the
above minute with the state of the fund. and sign
it on behalf of the committee Then adjourned. At a meeting of the Committee on Indian concerns
At Balt. 2 Mon 4th, 1799. Present 9 Members The following Report from the com. appointed
to extend care respecting some Indians on the Muskingum
river being produced was read and their procedings approved To the Committee on Indian Concerns, In the course of an attention to our appointment we
proceded as far as George Town on the Ohio river 65 Miles
from Redstone, with an intention of visiting the Mora-
vian Indians on Muskingum and being there informed
that John Heckewelder their agent had lately gone
home to Bethleham and before his departure had
procured a supply of provisions for the winter for those
Indians, that they ware dispursed in hunting camps
and few of them at their Town, we did not think it
necessary, we proceded in that direction, but Thomas Smith 
a friend who lives near Georgetown, having informed
us that 8 or 10 families of other Indians dispersed
in hunting parties on the braches of Tuscrawas
were very desirous of being instructed in farming
and were in want of a temporary supply of
Provisions, we believed it wright to turn our
attention to them, and having sent for some of their
active men to meet us, we were at last prevented
from an interview by the ice running in the Ohio. After leaving a supply for their relief when they
could get over the river we returned to redstone and
engaged with a smith to make a few farming utensils We have not received any answer on the
subject communicated to their chiefs last year, and
have reason to believe it is accasioned by the alarm
spread among them last spring, which probably
prevented its being laid before their general council
which is held at that season of the year at the 
lower Sandusky Town—and from the information received in
this journey we are free to inform the committee as
our judgement that it would tend to increase among the
western Indians a confidence in us as a people if Friends
could believe it right to send a few suitable persons
to attend next spring at their general Council in
which the chippeways & ottoways two powerful Nations
have considerable influence and who have not yet
been addressed on the subject proposed to the Wyandots

received since last meeting were read To The committee appointed by the Meeting of MarylandYearly
 to promote to gradual
civilization of the Indian Natives Dear Friends
We have for a considerable time
past believed advantage might arrise from an
epistolary intercourse with each other for as our
respective appointments direct the promotion
of simular concerns a knowledge of each others
prospects of labour (should any have opened) amongst
the Natives west of the river Ohio may be more
especially useful the Miami Nation have made
a request to us for some friends to settle amongst
them and a speech we have lately received from
the Delawares leaves scarce a doubt but a like
request will be made from that nation—hitherto
we have proceeded no further than to furnish the Mia-
mies with two plows a Harrow, gears, and sundry
useful articles nor is there a prospect of our
making a settlement amongst them soon Accompanying the Delaware Speech was
one from the Wyandot Nation a copy of which
we enclose you they were both delivered us by
Jonathan Shefflin superintendant of Indian
affairs in that Country as we have had no com-
munication with the Wyandotts, save some
friendly attention to two of their chiefs who
were in this City conformable to our usual custom
when Indians come here we enquired of Jonathan
Shefflin if he knew on what their expectation of
a visit was founded as we had given them none
he informed us it was an answer to a few lines
which were signed by two or three friends and left
at their Village as when they were there the
Indians were generally out a hunting—We suppose
it must have been those friends of your Committee
who were in that Country as from us none have
as yet been amongst the Nations West of the River
Ohio. If you have any answer to make thereto
it is probable Jonathan Shefflin will remain
here until the end of next month, it is desirable
the same may be forwarded as early as convenient
we are aware that Indians very generally take as
promises what may be suggested to them for
their consideration as probable to take place if
they unite with it, we have of late been very
guarded in our communications with them as
the more we become acquainted with the Indian
Character the greater necissity we perceive for
it Signed on behalf and by direction of the

Phila. 2 Mo 27 1799 Speech delivered by the Crane principal
Chief of the Wyandot Nation of Indians on
behalf of the whole of said Nation at Detroit
8 day of Sept. 1798 Addressed to the people called Quakers Brethren Quakers
You remember that we once
met at a certain place; when we had met at that certa-
in place a great many good things were said, and
much friendship was professed between us, Brethren—
you told us at that time when we met together: That
you not only took us by the hand, but that you
held us fast by the arm, That you then formed a
Chain of Friendship: you said it was not a
Chain of Iron, but that is was a chain of
precious Metal, a chain of silver, which would
bind us in brotherly affection forever, Brethren; you then said, That this Chain
of Friendship would bind us together so fast
that we should never part. It is our sincere
wish that the Chain of Friendship so made
should never be Broken, nay not by the efforts
of the evil Spirit himself. Brethren; These are only a few words that
I recollect of a great many that were said at
that time and place. We have no records or place
of security for our Speeches as you have—Nor
can we write as you do—Our Belts of Wampum
are our only records, But if you examine your
old Books and papers you will there find written
all that passed between your Forefathers and ours Brethren listen
The Wyandat Nation your
Brethren, are happy to hear that you have not
forgot what our Grandfathers agreed on at that time We have often heard—That you were a good and
Faithful People, ever ready to do Justis and good to all
Men whether they were white or black—Therefore we
love you the more sincerely, because of the goodness
of your hearts, what has been talked of amongst our
nations long since, Brethren, My brethren the wyandots are
happy to be informed, that some of you express
a wish to pay us a visit, When you do come forward
for that purpose we will then show you, a 
of Wampum which was given to us by your
forfathers, with a piece of written parchmen affixed
thereto when you see the belt of wampum and have
read the writing on the parchment you no doubt will
then perfectly know us and will concider us brethren
united by a chain of friendship which never be broken
whilst Memory lasts. Brethren listen—As I have mentioned before
so let us procede. We are much pleased to hear
that you still hold in remembrance our nephews
the Delaware nation, The promisses and obligations
made between your grandfathers and ours included
our two Nations (Wyandots and Delawares) in the
Chain of friendship and brotherly love, concidering us
as one and the same people, which chain we pray,
that the great Spirit will never permit to be
divided, Brethren Listen!
By strictly adhering to the
treaty of brotherly love which our Grandfathers
(who now exist no longer) formed for us and our
future generations we will the more peaceful-
lly and quietly wander upon this earth, on
which the great Spirit, the master and all
things was pleased to plant us, the read People
and then you our white Brethren among us
and our and children will walk the
longer—likewise our young men—and old people
upon the earth, Signed Tarhie (Crane) Ska hon wot (Standing Tree) John Adams Mai i rai (walk on ye water) After some time spent in a solid & weighty
attention to the pact of the communication
from the Chiefs of the Wyandot Nation of Indians
relating to a visit at the time proposed, the follow-
ing friends are added to the committee heretofore
appointed, who are desired to endeavour to visit
those Indians agreeable to their request in order

in answer to that rec. from Philadelphia being
approved was signed & directed to be forwarded
being as follows To the Committee appointed by the
Yearly Meeting of Philadelphia to promote the
Civilization of the Indians Dear Friends
The corresponce has on
our part been suspended till some Acc. should
be received from the Western Indians which
is now communicated to you they probably
conceiving that Friends wherever situated act
as one Body united—and as Friends in Pensylv.
have had a correspondence with them at
times from the first settlement of the Country
and as they in their present address have aluded
to former transactions it seems the more necessary
for us to apply to you for information on
that head—Aware of our own inability at present
to do any great matters we have endeavourd to
guard against raising their expectations—A speech
was sime time ago communicated to some of
the chiefs of the Wyandot Nation at the Upper
San Dusky, with a view to inform them that
we were desirous of turning their minds to some
of the most simple arts of civil life and wished to
know of them whether it would be agreeable to
make such a movement they informed us
that they would lay the subject before their
Council and return an answer—a Copy of
the Speech was left with them address to the Chiefs
of the Wyandot Shawanesse & Delaware Nations
and of which we herewith hand you a Copy We should have been pleased with the
reception of the orriginal Speech of the Wyandot
Chiefs and the belt of Wampum, with a Copy
of that from the Delawares & Miamies the
latter being we expect of the Shawanese Nation
five of our number are now appointed to
attend at San Dusky at the time the Wyandot
Chiefs have proposed of which you will please
to inform the Superintendant and communicate
to us such further information on the subject
as you may conceive to be necessary we also
suggest the propriety and usefulness of your app-
ointing few friends to unite in the visit, since
the prudent conducting of the matter may be of
great importance As you are better acquainted than we are
with the mode of conducting business with the
Indians if you think a Belt of wampum will
be necessary on our part you will please to
procure one for us suitable for the purpose to
be forwarded with the orriginal Speech &
Belt received by you and we will remit you
the Amount as soon as you advise us thereof Signed on behalf of the Committee

should believe it necessary to afford them some

made some provission for 8 or 10 families on the
Turkerawars branch of that river who appeared in

whom proceeded on the Journey and have produced
the following Report Pursuant to our appointment we set out
on a visit to the Indians the 7th of the 5 Mo last
and after passing through two of their towns arrived
on the 3rd of the most month at upper Sandusky
the principal village of the Wyandotts where we
met with a friendly reception from Tarhic the
head Chief and others of that Nation Upon confering with them we found a mis-
take had been made in the translation of the
speech which they sent to friends, respecting the
time of opening their great Council which they
now informed us began annually at the full
moon in this month and finding it would be
difficult to procure subsistance for ourselves & horses
here until that time We concluded it would
under our present circumstances, be best to
propose to Tarhic a conference with him &
the other Chiefs who were then at San Dusky
which was accordingly agreed to, and at the time
appointed we met him and two other chiefs at
his own house, when we had a full opportunity
with them on the subject of our visit Our communication appeard to be rec.
with great satisfaction by them and in their
answer deliverd to us on some strings of Wampum
which we were desired to take with us to Friends they
expressed the gratitude they felt for the care and
friendship their beloved brethren the Quakers had always
manifested for the Indians & informed us that as
soon as the grand Council met they would communi-
cate to it the concern which our society now felt
for their improvement and inform us by a written
speech of their conclusion thereon While we were at San Dusky and other
Indian Villages our minds were often deeply
affected under the sorrowful consideration of
the baneful effects of spiritous Liquors on them
they being supplied with it in almost every village
by Cannadian Traders residing amongs them and
we are confirmed in the opinion from furnishing
them with this distructive article in exchange
for their skins & furs they will not easily be
persuaded to turn their minds towards agriculture
and the useful arts. At the same time we have
no doubt but these unprincipaled men will make
use of the great influence they have over the Indians
to keep them in their present way of living as most
conducive to their own interest, notwithstanding
which present discouragement, they great affection
they have fore our society manifested on all occasions
while we were amongst them, induces us to
wish friends may endeavour to keep under the
weight of the concern and be prepared to proceed
in this benevolent word whenever the way may
open for further service amongst them Signed

Follows To Tarhic Buckengihilas and other chiefs of
the Wyandot and Delaware Nation of Indians Brothers
You sent us a speech & Belt of Wampum
from your great council held last fall was 2 years
at Detroit. In that speech you told us that then
was a Chain of friendship formed between your
forefathers and ours, that you were then told it
was a chain of precious metal, a chain of
silver that would never grow rusty and that it
would bind us in brotherly affection forever Brothers We were glad to hear, that you still
keep in remembrance this agreement between your
grand fathers & ours when they first met on your
land on this great Island—ever since that time we
have held fast our end of this chain of friendship Brothers In that speech you told us, that if any
amongst us were sent to visit you in your
tents the next summer that they would be likely
to go by San Dusky and that you would then
take them not only by the hand but by the arm
and conduct them safe to the grand Council
fire of your great Sasteretsy where every thing
good is transacted & nothing bad is permited to
appear Brothers We accordingly sent out some of
our friends about 2 years ago, these went as far
as upper San Dusky—you received them like brethren
but they found that they had got there too soon
for your great council and having little pro-
vissions for themselves & horses and not being accus-
tomed to live in the woods, they were discouraged
from proceeding any further and proposed to hold
a talk with some of your chiefs then present
these chiefs agreed to it and when they met our
friends made a speech to them and they ret.
an answer on 4 things of Wampum, but the
young man that talked between them, could not
speak plain and our friends were sorry they could
not fully understand what was said at that time
and expect that your Chiefs did not understand
what our friends said for they told us you intended
to send us soon the conclusion of your great council respecting our business with you &
we have had no account from you since Brothers They were also discouraged on account
of the abundant use of Spiritous Liquors amongst
your people apprehending it did them much injury &
if continued you might prevent our being capable of
rendering you much service Brothers We are listening to hear what you have
to say to us and have sent you this speech appre-
hending you have not understood what has been hereto-
fore communicated to you and lest you have not
understood it we again ask you if you are willing
to have your children instructed at home on your
own lands how to raise plenty of corn, make
cloathes & build houses, to keep your old men, your
women & Children warm when the weather is cold
and that you may not suffer for want when game
gets scarce in your hunting country Balt.4 Mo 17 1801

Turtle and the Five Medals, and do hereby
certify, that they are taken down with ac-
curacy.
WILLIAM WELLS, (Interpreter)
and Agent for Indian affairs. Proceedings of the first Conference.
A member of the society of Friends open-
ed the conference by addressing the
chiefs as follows: Brothers and Friends,
I AM desirous that in the early part
of this opportunity, you may be inform-
ed, that the people called Quakers con-
sider all mankind as their brethren; that
they believe the Great Spirit and Father
of Mankind created all men of one blood;
and that it is the will of Him who also
created the Sun, the Moon and the Stars,
and causes them to give us light—that
Great Spirit and common Father of all
Mankind—that we should not do one
another hurt, but that we should do one
another all the good we can; and it is
on this ground and this principle that
we believe it tight to take you by the
hand. After sitting a short time in silence,
another Friend addressed them as fol-
lows:-- Brothers and Friends,
We the people called Quakers believe
that it is required of us, that we should
all love one another, however separated
we may be in our local settlements in the
world, or whatever difference there may
be in our color: And as we are convinc-
ed it is not in our power to perform our
religious duties to Him that hath created
us, without his assistance, so we conceive
it to be our duty, when we are about to
enter upon such weighty business as I ap-
prehend this is, thus to sit down in stillness,
in order to endeavor to feel after the operation
of his spirit in our hearts, and we believe
that this cannot be attained by our own
natural powers, but must be under the in-
fluence of the Good Spirit. We also be-
lieve that there is an evil spirit, which is al-
ways striving to lead us into wrong things:
that Spirit which leads us to hate and de-
story one another: and in this persuasion
of mind, we believe it necessary for us
to sit down in stillness and quiet, to
wait upon the Great Spirit. Under these
impressions we are concerned often to as-
semble ourselves together, that we may
individually come under an exercise and
concern, to be rightly directed inour re-
ogious movements; and once in the year
we assemble at certain places, in order to
have a general and full conference, to
know how things are amongst us as a
people. One of these meetings is held
at Philadelphia and another at Baltimore.
At our yearly meeting at Baltimore se-
veral years past, our minds were brought
under a concern on behalf of our bre-
thren the Indians; and remembering the
friendship that had subsisted between our
society and the Indians, from the first
settlement of our fathers upon this con-
tinent, and at the same time recollecting
that the country to the westward was
fast settling, apprehensions arose in our
mind, that as the game became scarce,
they would be brought under sufferings,
and as there had been long wars between
some of the white people and the Indi-
ans, we had not had, for a long time,
an opportunity of taking our brothers,
the Indians, by the hand. Now, bro-
thers, as we were thus led by the con-
cern that arose in our council, some of
us were appointed to go out into the
wilderness, and endeavor to get amongst
our brethren the Indians, that we might
have some talk with them; and amongst
those who were appointed, this my bro-
ther, who sits at my right hand, was
one: and I have thought that he per-
haps can give a more full account both
of the time, and of our first movements
at the concern. The Friend alluded to then proceed-
ed:-- Brothers,
About six years ago, we believe the
Good Spirit put into our hearts, at our
great council held in this town, to endea-
vor to do something for the Indians; and
about four years ago, two others, besides
myself, went over the Great Mountains
westward, in order to see your situation,
and to know your disposition, whether you
would receive any thing from us or not.
We wished to go to Sandusky, expecting
to find the greatest number of Indians at
that place. We could not get a guide till
we got to the forks of Scioto, where we
agreed with one to take us to Isaac Zane’s.
--At that place we were informed that
a number of chiefs were at Detroit.—
We sent for some Wyandot chiefs who re-
sided about 25 miles from Isaac Zane’s ,
and had a conference with them. We in-
formed them of the desire our society had
to do something for the Indians that would
be useful to them. From thence we went
to Upper Sandusky—Isaac Zane piloted
us, and there also had a conference with
some of the Delaware chiefs. We want-
ed to know whether they would be wil-
ling to be instructed on their own lands
in a way to procure a sufficiency for them
to eat; to have a mill to grind their corn’
and have their children instructed to read
and write. They informed us that they
could not give us an answer at that time,
but would lay our proposals before their
council. About three years ago we received a
speech and a belt of Wampum from a
council held at Detroit; the speech did
not contain an answer to the proposals
made to them, but an invitation to us to
attend their council.—[A short pause:]
The Little Turtle, chief of the Miamis,
said, “Brother,
It is not usual for us to interrupt any
One in speaking, but I wish to enquire
from whom the speech you mention came."
The speech was then produced, and the
names to it read. –-Little Turtle, adds, I see that our brothers, the Quakers,
are not so fully acquainted with the situ-
ation of the Indians as we wish. After
we have taken the great chief of the
white people by the hand, I hope he will
give you full information with respect to
us.
The friend who had been interrupted, then
proceeded: 
 Two years, last spring, seven of us went
over the Ohio, and thence to Upper San-
dusky, at the time mentioned in the speech
that was sent to us—We were invited to
be there about the first of June, and ac-
cordingly got there about that time—but
were informed that the council was not to
be held till about two weeks after. Not
being accustomed to their mode of living,
and finding a considerable number of the
Indians at that place intoxicated with li-
quor, we were much discouraged, and
concluded we might as well return home
again. The Indians however, notwith-
standing their situation, treated us very
kindly. –We got together several chiefs of
the Wyandots, and communicated to them
our business—They informed us they
would lay it before the chiefs at the coun-
cil and return us an answer; but we have
not yet received one. The friend who made the second commu-
nication, addressed them again as fol-
lows: Brothers and Friends,
We were glad when we heard that sone
of our red brethren were come to this city,
and felt our minds drawn to take them by
the hand, in order that we might have an
opportunity of knowing them. As we
had not been acquainted with their situa-
tions and circumstances, we have not
been able to judge whether any thing we
had to propose to do for them would be
accepted? –Whether they were under the
necessity of applying to some other mode
for a livelihood? –Whether the game in
their country was in plenty? We have
thought, brothers, that if it should not yet
be the case that the game is scarce, it pro-
bably will be the case at some time; and
therefore we thought it would be best for
our red brethren to gibe some attention to
 the cultivation of the soil. This is one of the
subjects which has claimed our considerati-
on. And feeling in our hearts that we loved
the Indians, and wished their welfare, it was
our concern that they might be instructed
to turn their attention to the cultivation
of their lands. And as we believe, broth-
ers, that we derive very great advantages
from reading books which contain much
instruction, & wishing that our brethren, the
Indians, should also derive the same advan-
tages with us, we have wished that they
should candidly let us know, whether they
desire these things, that we might do for
them whatever is in my power to do. After a pause, the Little Turtle observed,
“Brothers and Friends,
If there is any thing more that you have’=
to say we wish to hear it; but if not I will
make a short reply to what we have already
heard you say." He was desired to pro-
ceed; when rising on his feet he said— Friends and Brothers,
My heart returns thanks to the Great
Spirit above, that has put it in our power
to speak to each other. My brother
chiefs, with myself, are glad that our
friends and brothers the Quakers, have
such great compassion for their red bre-
thren. Friends and Brothers,
Your red brethren believe, that one man
--one Great Man—made all the men that
are on the earth; and that he made men
when he made the earth, and that he made
the sun, the moon and the stars to give
light and to be useful to them. Friends and Brothers,
We now rejoice that the Great Spirit has
made you feel that we stand in need of
the assistance which you have been describe-
ing to us, and to wish if possible to render
your red brethren those services which
they now are highly in need of. Brothers and Friends,
It appears to us, your red brethren, that
you have been kept in the straight path by
the Great and Good Spirit. We have been
led astray by inferior spirits: we now hope
that we may come upon your track and
follow it. Brothers and Friends,
The long and destructive wars that
have raged in the country of your red
brethren, since your fathers first camea-
mongst them, have caused their numbers
to be greatly diminished. Those that have
come amongst us have very much cheated
and imposed upon us. They have found us
simple and ignorant, and have taken very
great care to keep every thing from our
knowledge in order to profit by our ignor-
ance. Friends and Brothers,
We find that you are now disposed with
open arms to receive us, and we hope the
Great Spirit will assist you, together with the
great chief of the white people, whom we
are now about to apply to for help. Brothers and Friends,
At the treaty of Grenville, which is now
a little past six years ago, we received some
presents by the hands of the great war chief
of the Americans—(gen. Wayne) said
to be sent to us by our brothers the Qua-
kers. After this treaty, I was invited by
the great chiefs of the Americans to
visit them. It is now four years since
I visited them at Philadelphia, whilst the
great council was held at that city. I had
there opportunity to see our brothers the
Quakers, and received from their mouths
some talks: all these talks I wrapped up
in my heart, and when I returned home
to my brothers, I communicated to them
faithfully all those good things which you
had told us you were desirous to do for us. Friends and Brothers,
I am happy to say that these my red
brothers now present with me are chiefs,
who, in their own country are equally great
with myself. They were rejoiced to hear
your words delivered to them through me,
four years ago, and they are now equally
glad with myself, to hear from the mouths
of our brothers, the Quakers, the same
good words again. Brothers and Friends,
If we understand you right, you wish to
add comfort to our women and children by
teaching us some of your ways of living. I
am glad that the Great Spirit has put this
into your hearts, and am sorry that your
exertions have not yet been successful. Brothers and Friends,
I now assure you, that you hear the
voice of the Pattawattamy, Miami, De-
laware, Shawanese, Weas, Eel river, Pi-
ankashaw, Kickapoo and Kaskaskias tribes
of Indians, and that if you wish to do any
thing for any of these nations of Indians,
they will be ready at all times to receive
you—and we also will be ready at all times
to render you any assistance in our power. Brothers and Friends,
This is the first time that the Great Spi-
rit has brought us to take our brothers,
the Quakers of Baltimore, by the hand,
and we rejoice to hear them mention the
same things to us, that have heretofore
been mentioned to us by our brothers, the
Quakers of Philadelphia. Brothers, I some
time past received from our brothers, the
Quakers of Philadelphia, some tools amongst
which were two ploughs. I used them, & did
all I could to keep them from wearing out
--I was pleased with them: They have
now become necessary to be repaired. We
have nobody amongst us that can mend
them and they are now useless to me. Brothers and Friends,
It is now five days since we took our
brothers, the Quakers of Philadelphia by
the hand—we then talked over these things
together. They have promised me that at
their next great council, they will hold a
talk about these things, and consider what
they can do for us. Brothers and Friends,
If our brothers, the Quakers of Balti-
more, desire to do any thing for the In-
dians, I wish to give them full information
of the place where we may be found gene-
rally together. The great council of our
tribes of Indians, is held at Fort Wayne
at the time we receive our annuity from
the United States. At that time any com-
munications our Brothers wish to make to
their red brethren, will be safely handed to
us by your white brother, our interpreter
now with us, who is our agent at that
place. He then sits down—after a short pause
rises again, Brothers,
I must add a few words further: I find
that I have not fully answered all the
questions that our brothers have put to us. Brothers and Friends,
It is the real wish of your brothers the
Indians, to engage in the cultivation of our
lands—And although the game is not yet
so scarce, but that we can get enough to
eat, we know it is becoming scarce, and
that we must begin to take hold of such
tools as we see are in the hands of the
white people. Brothers and Friends,
We are now on our way to see the great
chiefs of the Americans at their council.
We are glad to find that they remember
their red brethren, and rejoice to believe
that the Great Spirit has put it into the
heart of the great chief of the white peo-
ple to do us such services as will add to the
comfort of his red children. Brothers and Friends,
I will now only add, that I rejoice to
believe that your friendship to your red
brethren is a friendship that is pure—a
friendship that comes from the heart—You
want no compensation from the Indians
for your services to them. You do not
want to take away our lands from us—
you have always made use of this language
to us; and it has always been with plea-
sure that I have communicated it to our
brethren. Brothers, we are a jealously
disposed people—almost every white man
that comes amongst us, endeavors all he
can to cheat us; this has occasioned jeal-
ousy among us. But your talks, brothers,
are different; we believe you, when you
say you want no compensation from us,
for your services to your red brethren. Sits down. Five Medals, chief of the Pattawattamies,
rises: Friends and Brothers,
I rejoice to hear that you have so much
compassion on your red brethren. As my
friend the Little Turtle has observed, it is
not the first time that we have received to-
kens of friendship from you. It is some
years since the treaty of Grenville, where
we first experienced the friendship of our
brothers, the Quakers. Some time after
the treaty, my friend the Little Turtle 
visited the great council of the white peo-
ple held at Philadelphia; he there saw our
friends and brothers, the Quakers—He
was there informed of their good wishes,
and of the great friendship they had for
their red brethren. He returned home
and informed of all the great talks he had
with our brothers, the Quakers, of Phila-
delphia. It is truly pleasing to me, Brothers, to
hear the same talks my friend had inform-
ed me of, now repeated on my arrival at
Baltimore by our friends and brothers the
Quakers. I hope, Brothers, that the Great Spi-
Rit, who has the disposal of men will assist
you in your laudable undertakings, and
enable you to be of service to your red
Brethren. Friends and Brothers,
The talks that you have now delivered
to us shall be carefully collected, wrapped
up, and put in our hearts—we will not for-
get them. On our return home we will
have them communicated from the head to
the mouth of the Wabasu—from this to
the Missisippi, and up that river until it
strikes the Lakes, thence round by Michil-
limackanack until they come back again
to the same place. What we say to you,
you may be assured does not come from one
man—it comes from many—and what you
have said to us, you speak it to but a
few, but it shall be communicated to many. Brothers and Friends,
I observed to our friends the Quakers
of Philadelphia, five days ago, what I
now say to you—That we wish our bro-
thers, the Quakers, to render us those
services which they have proposed. We
promise that nothing shall be wanting on
our part to give aid to so desirable a
thing in our country. Our situation at
present will not admit of carrying such
a plan so fully into execution as might
be desired by our brothers; but that, I
hope, will not prevent you from making
trial. If we had such tools as you make
use of and which add so much to your
comfort—for we have been lost in wonder
at what we have seen amongst you—if
we had these instruments, we should, I
hope, be willing to use them; and in the
course of a little time, there would be
people amongst us that would know well
how to use them, through the assistance
they might obtain from you and the rest
of our white friends. Brothers and Friends,
Whatever goods you may have in store
for your red brothers, we cannot but wish
that you will shew them to us as soon
as possible. That we can yet live upon
the game of our country, is true; but
we know that this will not be the case
long. Brothers, from the great things and
the astonishing wonders which we have
seen among you, and finding that they
all come out of the earth, it makes me anx-
ious to try if I cannot get some for my-
self. I hope, brothers, that by the aid
of the Great Spirit, and of our friends
and brothers, the Quakers, together with
the government of the United States, that
we shall yet be enabled to get these good
things for ourselves—such as will make
us, our women, and our children happy. Brothers,
We do not know what our brothers, the
Quakers of Philadelphia, may have in con-
templation to do for their red brethren, but
we hope it will be something that will add
to our comfort; we hope it will be some-
thing by which we shall profit; something
by which we shall be enabled to cultivate
our lands, and live by the fruits of the
earth. We have been walking in a thorny
path; we want to get into your track and
follow it; and the sooner this is put into
our power, I am convinced the better it
will be for our red brethren. Brothers and Friends,
I have not much to say further; what
has now been said to you is the voice
of the Pattawattamy, Miami, Delaware,
Shawanese, Weas, Eel-River, Pianka-
Shaw, Kickapoo, and Kaskaskias tribes
of Indians. I rejoice, brothers, that we
now know each other, and hope if you have
any thing to communicate to your red
brethren, that it will come to us through
your brother, William Wells , our inter-
preter, who resides in our country. We
can place great confidence in him: He
if the only white man in our country we
will trust; we shall then get it, and do
now assure you, that is shall be faithfully
sent to all these people, in the manner
you wish it to be. Brothers and Friends,
I hope the Great Spirit will assist you
in your undertakings to do your red
brethren good. Your movements towards
the Wyandots have not met with that
success which they have deserved. It
makes me sorry to find an answer form
them of the kind you have mentioned.
There is a great deal, brothers, in hav-
ing a good interpreter, and beginning at the
right end of the business. [The proceedings of the second conference will
appear in our next.] Proceedings of a committee appointed by the
yearly meeting of the respectable society of
Friends, with the Indian chiefs—conclud-
ed from yesterday’s Gazette. SECOND CONFERENCE. One of the society of Friends opened the
conference as follows: Brothers and Friends,
WHEN the talk which we had last
evening at this place ended, I believe it
was generally understood that the subject-
matter which had been spoken to was sa-
tisfactory; but on considering further,
some of us though that there were some
things of considerable importance, which
had not been spoken upon—and thought
that it would be right to have another op-
portunity. We are accordingly again
assembled—and seeing that it has been
the will of the Great Spirit and Father of 
us all, to permit us thus to come together
again, it is my desire that any thing we
may feel in our hearts that may be likely to
have a tendency to promote the good of
our red brethren, may be freely spoken. Another Friend next addressed them as
follows: Friends and Brothers,
I may tell you, I have been made glad,
that I have an opportunity of sitting once
more with you; and as I have found that
the more I am with you, the more the
love I have felt for you has increased, and
the stronger has been my desire for your
welfare, and that this love has taken away
all fear of giving offence; I feel myself
authorized, I think, as a brother, to use
freedom of speech with you, and in the
freedom which I feel, under the influence
of that love which I trust has been impress-
ed upon my heart by the great and good
Spirit, who as he has made us all of one
blood so he requires of us that we should
 ove one another. I may tell you brothers,
that, when I was in the Indian country,
I had frequent opportunities of observing
the pernicious consequences of the use of
spirituous liquors, with which the Indians
were furnished by the traders, and as I
have reason to believe, that you who are
now present are wise men, men who have
eyes in your heads, and are able to see
things as they really are, I have felt a de-
sire in my heart to know your opinions,
and what is your judgment concerning
this thing—the using spiritous liquors
to excess. Believing brothers, that if
you have seen things in the same light in
which I have seen them, that you would
be desirous that a stop might be put to the
evils that arise from the use of so destruct-
tive a liquor, I may tell you, brothers,
who are now present, as well as the In-
dians in general, that I have believed there
is not any thing that stands more in your
way to improvement than this; the too
frequent use of spiritous liquors: and I
have thought that if you are of the same
mind with us who are your Friends, and
have your good at heart, that it would be
right for us to take the subject into our
serious consideration, to endeavor to dis-
cover, whether there may not be some steps
taken, that would put a check upon this
pernicious thing. Now, brothers, as a hint of this sort was
omitted when we were together last even-
ing, some of us did not find our minds easy:
we thought it ought to have come under
consideration, hoping that you who, as I
have already said, have eyes in your heads,
and can see for yourselves, have had this
subject under your consideration. We now
hope brothers that you will express your-
selves freely to us on this subject, and let
us know how it has appeared to you.
After which, way perhaps will open for
some further observations from us. After a short pause the Little Turtle on
his seat expresses, I will now make some
reply, if none of my brothers have further to say. He was desired to proceed—when rising on
his feet he said, My Brothers and Friends,
I am happy to find that it has pleased
the Great Spirit, that we should again this
evening meet in the same house in which
we held our council yesterday. I am hap-
py to find that it is the will of the Great
and Good Spirit, that we should discover,
there was something yesterday not menti-
oned, that was highly necessary for the
welfare of your red brethren. Friends and Brothers,
I am glad to find that it has pleased the
Great Spirit to put a wish in your hearts
to know our opinions on the subject you
have mentioned; a subject of the greatest
moment to us. What you have said re-
lative to our being one flesh and one blood
is true. Your brothers the Indians believe
that it is in this light the Great Spirit con-
siders all mankind. Brothers and Friends,
My brother chiefs that are now present,
with myself, are happy to find, that you
have a good opinion of us. You say, that
you apprehend we have eyes in our heads,
and can clearly see for ourselves those
things that are injurious to us; this, my
friends and brothers, is the case; we clear-
ly see these things: my brother chiefs that
are now present with me, as well as myself,
have long seen them; we have long lament-
ed these great evils that have raged in our
country, and that have done your red
brethren so much harm; we have applied
for redress, and endeavored to have them
removed from amongst us. When our forefathers met first on this
Island, your red brethren then were numer-
ous; but since the introduction amongst
us of what you call spirituous liquors, and
what we think may justly be called poison,
our numbers are greatly diminished: It
has destroyed a great part of our red bre-
thren. My Brothers and Friends,
I am glad to hear you observe, that free-
dom of speech ought always to be made
use of amongst brothers; this, brothers,
really ought to be the case. I will now,
therefore, take the liberty to mention, that
most of the exciting evils amongst your red
brethren, have been caught from the white
people; not only that liquor that destroys
us daily, but many diseases that our fore-
fathers were ignorant of before they say
you. My Brothers and Friends,
I am glad, with my brother chiefs, that
are now present, to find that you are rea-
dy to assist us in every thing that will add
to our good: we hope that the Great
Spirit will aid you in all your good under-
takings with respect to us. We plainly
perceive, brothers, that you see that very
evil that destroys your red brethren. It
is not an evil, brothers, of our own making;
we have not placed it amongst us by the white
people; we look up to them to remove it
out of our country: If they have that
friendship for us which they tell us they
have, they certainly will not let it conti-
nue amongst us any longer. Our repeat-
ed entreaties to those who bring this evil
amongst us, we find, has not the desired
effect. We tell them—Brothers, fetch us
useful things; bring goods that will clothe
us, our women and our children, and not
this evil liquor that destroys our reason—
that destroys our health—that destroys
our lives: But all we can say on the sub-
ject is of no service, nor gives relief to
your red brethren. My Brothers and Friends,
I am glad that you have seen into this
business as we do—I rejoice to find that
you agree in opinion with us, and express
an anxiety to be, if possible, of service to
us, to remove this great evil out of our
country—an evil that has had so much
room in it—that has destroyed so many
of our lives that it causes our young men
to say, We had better be at war with
the white people: this liquor that they in-
troduce into our country is more to be
feared than the gun and the tomahawk:
there are more of us dead since the treaty
Grenville, than we lost by the six
years war before; it is all owning to the in-
troduction of this liquor amongst us.—
Brothers, how to remove this evil from our
country we do not know; if we had known
that it would have been a proper subject to
have mentioned to you in our council yes-
terday, we should surely have done it.
This subject, brothers, composes a part of
what we intend to make known to the great
council of our white brethren. On our
arrival there, we shall endeavor to explain
to our great father, the president, a great
many evils that have arisen in our country
from the introduction of this liquor by the
white traders. Brothers and Friends,
In addition to what I have before ob-
served of this great evil in the country of
your red brethren, I will say further, that
it has made us poor. It is this liquor that
causes our young men to go without
clothes, our women and children to go
without any thing to eat; and sorry am I
to mention now to you, brothers, that the
evil is increasing every day, as the white
settlers come nearer to us, and bring those
kettles they boil that stuff in they call whis-
key, of which our young men are so ex-
tremely fond. Brothers, when our young
men have been out hunting, and are return-
ing home loaded with skins and furs, on
their way if it happens that they come
along where some of this whiskey is depo-
sited, the white man who sells it tells them
to take a little drink; some of them will
say, No, I do not want it—they go on till
they come to another house, where they
find more of the same kind of drink; it is
there again offered, they refuse, and again
the third time, but finally the fourth or
fifth time one accepts of it and takes a
drink, and getting one he wants another,
and then a third and a fourth till his senses
have left him. After his reason comes
back again to him, he asks for his peltry:
The answer is, you have drank them.
Where is my gun? It is gone. Where is my
shirt? You have sold it for whiskey!! Now,
brothers, figure to yourselves what a con-
dition this man must be in; he has a fami-
ly at home, a wife and children that stand
in need of the profits of his hunting: what
must their wants be when he himself is even
without a shirt? This, Brothers, I can assure you, is a
fact that often happens among us; as I
have before observed, we have no means
to prevent it. If you, Brothers, have it
in your power to render us any assistance,
we hope the Great Spirit will aid you—
we shall lay these evils before our great
and good father; we hope he will remove
them from amongst us; we shall assure
him that if he does not, there will not be
many of his red children living long in our
country. The Great Spirit, Brothers, has
made you see as we see; we hope, Bro-
thers, and expect, that if you have any in-
fluence with the great council of the Unit-
ed States, that you will make use of it in
behalf of your red brethren. My Brothers and Friends,
The talks that you delivered to us when
we were in council yesterday, were cerain-
ly highly pleasing to myself as well as to
my brother chiefs; we rejoiced to hear
you speak such words to us; but we all
plainly saw that there was a great difficulty
in the way that ought to be removed be-
fore your good intentions towards us could
be carried into effect: we agree with you,
Brothers, that this great evil amongst us,
spirituous liquors, must first be removed;
after this is done, we hope you will find
an easy access to us, much earlier than you
can have at present. My Brothers and Friends,
I hope that if we all try to prevent the
introduction of spiritous liquors in the
country of your red brethren, that the
Great Spirit will aid us in it, and that we
shall meet with no difficulty in doing it;
after this is done, we hope that the great
services you have designed to do for us, the
great things mentioned by you in our
council yesterday, may take place and
have that success you so much desire. My Brothers and Friends,
You have asked us our opinion on the
subject of the introduction of spiritous li-
quors into our country. I have now given
it to you. If I have given it to you in such
a manner that you do not understand me,
I would wish to be make known to
every body. We have our enemies in our
own country as all other persons have in
theirs; it is no unusual thing, Brothers,
to hear some people amongst us, (you
will perceive, Brothers, that these are
people that are interested in keeping us
ignorant,) when they hear talks that have
been delivered by our chiefs to people that
are capable of rendering us services, they
say to our people, do you not hear?
your chiefs have sold you—your chiefs
have sold your lands. They put bad
stories in the mouths of our young men:
for this reason, Brothers, all that I have
said I wish to be made public; I wish
every body to know it. I only mention
this to you, Brothers; if it is improper,
I have no objection to your keeping it
amongst yourselves, but if it could be
made public I would wish it—I have nothing
further to say. Sits down. Five Medals , then rises of his feet. My Brothers and Friends,
I have nothing to say on the subject,
we have now been talking over. My friend
the Little Turtle has given you a full an-
swer to those things you have mentioned to
us; we are but one people and have but
one voice. Brothers and Friends,
We have never had it in our power to
hold such talks with you at this place be-
fore. We have frequently had talks of
this kind with our brothers, the Quakers
of Philadelphia; they always appeared
very glad to see us, and we find you the
same. We hope brothers, that your
friendship and ours will never be broken.
Sits down. The friend who delivered the second
communication, then again addressed them
as follows: Friends and Brothers,
What you have communicated to us at
this time, has been clearly understood—
and we are glad to find that you see things
in the same light that we see them. The
several matters you have mentioned, and
the difficulties you have stated, claim our
sympathy and solid consideration, and we
shall, I trust, take the subject up, and if
way should open for us to move forward,
in aiding you in your application to the
general government, we shall be willing,
either on this occasion, or any other, to
render every service in our power. To the Congress of the United States. The memoral of the committee appointed
for Indian affairs by the yearly meeting
of Friends, held in Baltimore,
Respectfully represents— THAT a concern to introduce among
some of the Indian tribes north-west of the
river Ohio, the most simple and useful arts
of civil life, being several years since laid
before our yearly meeting, a committee
was appointed by that body to visit them,
to examine their situation, and endeavor
to ascertain in what manner so desirable a
purpose could be both effected—A part of
that committee after having obtained the
approbation of the president of the United
States, proceeded to perform the service
assigned them, and the result of their
enquiries and observations, as reported to
the yearly meeting, was, that the quantity
of spirituous liquors with which those
people are supplied by traders and frontier
settlers, must counteract the effect of every
measure, however wise of salutary, which
can be devised to improve their situation. The truth of this being abundantly
confirmed by a speech recently made before
us by the Miami chief, the Little Turtle ,
which we herewith offer to your considera-
tion, and believe the evil to be of such
magnitude, that unless it can be altogether
removed, or greatly restrained, no ration-
al hope of success in the proposed under-
taking can be entertained, we are induced
to solicit the attention of the national le-
gislature to this interesting and important
subject, a subject which we believe involves
not only their future welfare, but even
their very existence as a people.

at Baltimore 13. 10 Mon 1802 Present 9 Members A report to the Yearly Meeting was agreed on as
follows To the yearly Meeting now sitting The Committee on Indian affairs agree to report
that divers of their number in company with other
friends have had since last year two conferrences with the
little Turtle and some other principal Indian Chiefs
residing NW. of the river Ohio they being chiefs of those
Indians whom the Yearly Meeting had in contemplation
to adjust. The first conference was on the subject of the Intro-
duction of agriculture and some other useful arts of
Civil life, part of the little Turtles reply being as
follows Brothers & Friends
It is the real wish of your
brothers the Indians to engage in the culture of our
lands, and although the Game is not yet so scarse
but that we can get enough to eat. We know
it is becoming scarce and that we must begin to take
hold of such tools as we see are in the hands of the
white people. The second conference was on the subject of the intro-
duction and excessive use of Spirituous liquors among
the Indians. To this the little turtle made a pathetic
and lengthy reply, part of one paragraph being as
follows My Brothers & Friends
I am glad that you have
seen into this business as we do. I rejoice to find that you
agree in opinion with us and express an anxiety to be if possible
of service to us to remove this great evil our of our country, An evil that has had so much room in it. That has
destroyed so many of our lives. That it causes our young
men to say, We had better be at war with the white people,
this liquor that they introduce into our country is more
to be feared than the Gun and the Tomahawk
there are more of us dead since the treaty of Genville
than we last by the six years war before. It is all
owing to the Introduction of this liquor amongst us And on a weighty consideration of this subject
the Committee believed it right to address the following
Memorial to Congress org.

which was favourably received and a law passed au-
thorizing the President to take such measures from time
to time as to him may seem expedient to prevent or
restrain the vending of distributing Spiritous Liquors
among all or any of the said Indian Tribes On the subject of civilization the law states
that in order to promote civilization amongst the
friendly Indian Tribes and to secure the continuance
of their friendship it shall be lawful for the
President of the United States to cause them to be
furnished with useful domestic Annimals and
implements of husbandry and with Goods or Money
as he shall judge proper and to appoint such
persons from time to time as temporary agents to
reside amongst the Indians as he shall think fit
provided that the whole amount of such presents
and allowance to such agents shall not exceed $15000
Per annum Some of the committee have also had an
opportunity with the Secretary of war, who now has the
direction & management of Indian Affairs, & informed
them that Government had agreeable to the request
of the Indians established a trading House at fort
Wayne, that they were in want of several persons of
our Society qualified for different departments such
as Blacksmiths Carpenters & Superintendants, that they
wanted a Carpenter & Blacksmith such as can
make and mend Ploughs, Looms farming utensils &c

in their conduct and are concerned for the
promotion of the work in prospect to whom they
offer a generous compensation Baltimore 10 Mo 13 1802

of the object of our appointment the situation in which
we are placed, and with a full persuasion that the
situation of the business requires speedy attention—
as the obstructions that have heretofore prevented
Friends from moving forward in extending to
The Western Indians the benefits, some years ago
contemplated by the Yearly Meeting appear to be
now removed,--but the distant situation of many
of the committee from each other—the difficulty and
even impracticability of obtaining a general

of the Committee Adjourned Balt. 10 Mo 10 1803 At a Meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns the following report was agreed on
to the Yearly Meeting The Meeting was last year informed
that the Western Indians in the neighbourhood
of fort Wayne were desirous of engaging in the
cultivation of their lands, that they had requested
the assistance of Friends and that the President
of the United States was authorised to prohibit the
introduction of spiritous liquors amongst them. This
being the situation of the business, some of the committee
were impressed with a belief that it was necessary that
something should be done in it and accordingly
proceeded last spring for the use of these Indians 6
setts of Plough Irons and their apprentenances, such
as levers &c 10 leather collars, 10 Pair of harnis, 10 Pair
of Iron Chains, 10 back bands 50 axes 6 Mattocks
6 Iron wedges 6 Maul rings & 50 Hoes which were
sent in packages to Pittsburgh from whence they were
to be immediately conveyd to Fort Wayne & deliv-
ered as a present from the Society of Friends here
to the little Turtle & other Chiefs and to be by them
disposed of to such of their people as they knew were desirous
of using them. We also wrote a letter to the Indians &
one to William Wells (the agent at that place) and have
received his Answer informing that on the 25th of the 7
Month last he had an account of these articles
being on the way from Cincinati and expected they
would deliver them as directed & that he would also
receive the Indians reply to our letter & forward it to
us. This we have not yet received. The agent also informs that since there has
been no spiritous liquors in the Indian Country
they appear very industrious and are fond of raising
stock. He also gives it as his opinion that
the suppression of spiritous liquors in that Country is
the best thing that ever has been done for the Indians
by the United States, that there has not been one
Indian killed in that neighbourhood this year &
that there never has been a year before, since the
Treaty of Grenville in which there were less than 10
killed and some years as many as 30 The agent further adds that the Indians
appear very desirous of procuring for themselves
the necessarys of life in our way, but say they
do not know how to begin—some of their old
men say to him, the white people want for
nothing we wish them to show us how to pro-
cure the many good things we see amongst
them if it is their wish to instruct us Indians in
their way of living as they tell us it is we
wish them to make haste and do it for we are
old and must die soon, but we wish to see
our women and children in that Path which
will lead them to happyness before we die We have examined the Treasurers Acct. &

From the Little Turtle & Five Medals , Miamie &
Pottowattomie Chiefs
To Evan Thomas George Ellicott & Joel
Wright Brothers & Friends of our Hearts!
We have received your speech from our
friend Wells , with the implements of Husbandry that
you were so kind as to send us to his care, all in good
order Brothers!
It is our wish that the great spirit
will enable you to render your Red brethren that 
service which you appear to be so desirous of doing them
and their women and children are so much in need of. Brothers
We will try to use the Articles you have
sent us and if we should want more we will let
you know it Brothers
We are sorry to say that the minds of
our People are not so much inclined towards the
cultivation of the Earth as we could wish them Brothers
Our Father the President of the United States
has prevented our Traders from selling liquor to our
People which is the best thing he could do for his red children Brothers
Our people appear dissatisfied because the
Traders do not bring them Liquor as usual and we
believe they will request our father to let the Traders
bring them Liquor and if he does your red children
are all lost forever Brothers
You will see from what we have said
that our prospects are bad at present, though we hope
the Great Spirit will change the minds of our people
and tell them that it would be better for them to
cultivate the Earth than to drink whiskey Brothers
We hope the great Spirit will permit some
of you to come and see us, when you will be able to
know whether you can do any thing for us or not Brothers
We delivered you the sentiments of our
hearts when we spoke to you at Baltimore, and shall
say nothing more to you at present. We now take
each of you by the hand, and all the rest of our brothers
by the hand and thank you for the articles you were
so kind as to send us Brothers
We hope the Great Spirit will take
care of you your wives and children

Joel Wright 
George Ellicott The subject of a visit being made to the Indians
agreeable to the desire they express in the foregoing letter
being solidly considered, the committee are united in
judgment that a visit at this time to them would
be the most likely means of obtaining a knowledge
of the disposition they are in and enable Friends to ascertain
what would be the best course to pursue to be useful to them
the following friends are therefore nominated to that
service and requested to proceed in the visit as soon as
convenient, to witt. George Ellicott , Gerard T. Hopkins , Joel
Wright and Elisha Tyson . They are also authorised to take
one or more suitable persons with them, to reside amonst
the Indians, to instruct them in agriculture and other
useful knowledge, if then should appear a prospect of
such an establishment being beneficial to them The following friends are appointed to draw up
an address to the Indians, to be presented to them by
the Committee when they visit them and produce it to
a future meeting of this committee, to witt Edward
Stabler, Joel Wright , Elisha Tyson , Andrew Ellicott Jr. ,

affairs by the Yearly Meeting of friends in Maryland
 To the Little Turtle and Five Medals , chiefs of
the Miamie & Pottowattomie Nations of Indians and
others We have received your Talk communicated by our
friend William Wells , after the reception of the
implements of husbandry sent last spring for your
use, in that speech as well as when you were in Balti-
more you have told us that you, thought it best
for some of us to go out to see you, that they
might be the better capable of judging, what could
be done further for the benefit of our red brethren Brothers & Friends,
In compliance with your request
we have named our beloved friends George Ellicott 
Gerard T. Hopkins , Joel Wright & Elisha Tyson , to go &
visit you and to take you by the hand in our beh-
alf, and we desire you will receive them or any of

assisting you in what may add comfort to our red brethren and to their women
and children Your friends & brethren

committee adjourns Baltimore 10 Mo 15 1804 At a meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns present 16 Members and our friend Isaac
Bonsall from Pennsylvania The friends appointed at last meeting to
visit the Indians inform that two of them attended
to the service and produced the following report, to wit To the Committee on Indian concerns
appointed by the yearly meeting of Baltimore
We of the committee appointed in the 2nd Mo.
last to visit the western Indians, report, that on the
23rd of the same month we proceeded upon our
journey, accompanied by our friend Philip Dennis 
who had offered to go with us in order to remain with
the Indians during the season for the purpose of
instructing them in agriculture taking with him two
good horses to be employed in ploughing &c,. On the
30th of the 3rd Month we arrived at Fort Wayne
Situated on the Miami of the Lake, and at the
junction of the St. Mary’s & St. Joseph’s rivers Shortly after our arrival we convened a few
Indians, amongst whom were the Little Turtle and
the Five Medals (by whom we were received with
much apparent affection and friendship) and ac-
quianted them through the interpreter William Wells 
with the contents of the letter from the committee
directed to them and others. After which we expressed
to them a desire to see their chiefs and young men
more generally, having as we believed some things of
great importance, to their welfare to communicate
and knowing that it was the season of the year in
which most of the Indians were engaged in their
hunting and Sugar Camps, we requested them to
convene as many of their chiefs and principal young
men as could with convenience be collected in the
course of a few days. They expressed a desire that
we would not be in haste to return, but would remain
some time in their country, observing, that it was
their desire we should see their people generally, &
that the season of the year was near at hand, for
them to return to their Towns when they could readily
convene the most of them, adding, that they could
now collect a considerable number of their indolent
ones, who were too lazy to hunt or make sugar, but
such they did not wish us to see We informed them that we had with us
Philip Dennis who was willing to remain with them
during the season for the purpose of assisting them in
raising a crop of corn, and shewing them how to
do other things, that the time for him to commence his
operations being near at hand, required that we
should make haste. They replied that our reasons for
wishing them to meet early were very good and that
they would meet us on the 11 of the 4 Month At that time we were met by several of their
chiefs a considerable number of their principal young
men as also several of their women—when they informed
us that they were ready to hear any communications
from us and as they had previously requested, that
what we had to say might be put upon Paper, that
they might communicate our words, to the Indians
when generally assembled we delivered to them, through
the Interpreter the following address The address of George Ellicott & Gerard T. Hopkins 
on behalf of the people called Quakers at Baltimore to
the Little Turtle and the Five Medals chiefs of the Miami
and Pottowattomi Nations of Indians Brothers & Friends We know that most of our
red brethren are at present at their hunting Camps &
at their Sugar Camps and did not expect to see ma-
ny of them upon so short a notice, therefore as you re-
quested it we have put upon paper the things we had
to say and hope you will not fail to have our words
communicated when at some future time you may be
more generally assembled Brothers
When we were together eight days ago
with the Little Turtle and the Five Medals the
letter was read to them, which has just now been read
that letter you observe, says that we were appointed
by our friends and brothers the people called Quakers at
Baltimore to come and visit you and to take you by
the hand on their behalf desiring that you wold
receive any communications from us, as coming
immediately from them Brothers
After that letter was read our hearts were
filled with so much love for our red brethren that
on looking over and considering the business upon
which we had come, we felt a desire to see as many
of you together as could be convened and this day
was then agreed upon for us to meet you Brothers
We believed that the things which
we had to say were of great importance to the
welfare of our red brethren, and therefore it was that we
requested to see you together, that you all might
have an opportunity of hearing what we have to say Brothers
Our hearts are filled with thankfulness
to the great Spirit, that he has brought us safely to
the Country of our red brethren, and protected us
through our journey, we also rejoice that he has
 given us this opportunity of seeing you and of taking
you by the hand Brothers
It is now a little more than two
years since your brothers of Baltimore had an oppor-
tunity of becoming acquainted with their brothers
the Five Medals , Little Turtle , Tuthinepee and some other
chiefs, they were glad of that opportunity of having a
talk with them and of enquiring after the situation
of their red brethren Brothers
Your brothers of Baltimore had for
some time entertained apprehensions that the many
changes which were taking place in circumstances
must greatly alter the situation of their red brethren
and that the time was fast approaching in which is
would be necessary for them to change there mode
of living Brothers
After the talk with the chiefs whom
we have just mentioned we were fully convinced that
the time was come in which our red brethren ought
to begin to cultivate their lands, that they ought to
raise Corn and other grain, Cows, Sheep, Hogs, & other
Annimals, we then proposed to afford them some assis-
tance, they appeared to be glad of the proposal and
informed us that many of their people were disposed to
turn their attention to the cultivation of the Earth
--they also expressed a desire to be assisted by their
brothers of Baltimore Brothers
Having been encouraged by the opportu-
nity which we then had with our red brothers, we sent
to the care of William Wells some plows, harness for Horses
axes hoes and other implements of Husbandry, which were
made for the use of our red brethren & desired that
they might be distributed amongst them as tokens of
our friendship Brothers
Your brothers of Baltimore received
last fall through the hands of William Wells a
Talk from their brothers the Little Turtle & Five Medals 
and others informing us that they had received the
implements of Husbandry, and requested that their
brothers of Baltimore would send some of their peo-
ple into the country of their red brethren, for the
purpose of seeing their situation and shewing them
how to make use of the Tools saying they did not
know how to begin Brothers
It is for this purpose that we have
now come, and we again repeat that we rejoice we
have this opportunity of seeing you and of taking you
by the hand Brothers
In coming into the Country of
our red brethren we have come with our eyes open and
although we are affected with sorrow in believing that
many of the red people suffer much for the want of food
and for the want of cloathing yet our hearts have been
made glad in seeing that it has pleased the great Spirit
to give you a rich and valuable Country, because that
we know it is out of the Earth that food and cloathing
come. We are sure brothers that with but little labour &
attention you may raise much more corn and other
grain, than will be necessary for yourselves, your women
and children and may also with great ease raise many
more horses, cows, sheep, hogs and other valuable animals
than will be necessary for your own use we are also con-
fident that if you will pursue our method in the
cultivation of your lands that you will live in much
greater ease & plenty and with much less fatigue & toil
than attend hunting for a subsistence Brothers
We are fully convinced that if you will
adopt our mode of cultivating the Earth and of raising
useful animals that you will find it to be a mode
of living not only far more plentiful and much less
fatiguing but also a mode of living much more cer-
tain and which will expose your bodies less to the
inclemences of the weather than is attendant upon hunting
it will lead you to have fixed homes—you will build
comfortable dwelling houses for yourselves, your women
and children, where you may be sheltered from the rain
from the frost and from the snow, and where you may enjoy
in plenty the reward of your labour Brothers
In laying these things before you we have no
other motive than a desire of heart for the improvement
the bennefit and the welfare of our red brethren & therefore
it is that we speak with freedom and we hope that what
we have to say will go in at one Ear and not come out
at the other but that it will be remembered by our red
brothers, for we know that we shall not be ashamed of
what we say when in time to come you compare the things
we are saying to you with your experience in practising
them Brothers
We will mention that the time was
when the forefathers of your brothers, the white people lived
beyond the great water in the same manner that our
red brothers now live, the winters can yet be counted
when they went almost naked, when they procured their
living by fishing and by the bow and arrow in hunting &
when they lived in houses no better than yours. they
were encouraged by some who came from towards
the sun rising and lived amongst them to change
their mode of living—they did change—they cultivated
the Earth, and we are sure the change was a happy
one Brothers
We are not ashamed to acknowledge
that the time was, when our forefathers rejoiced at
finding a wild Plum Tree or at killing a little
game, and that they wandered up & down living on
the uncertain supplies of fishing and hunting, but
brothers for your encouragement we mention, that
by turning their attention to the cultivation of the
Earth, instead of the Plum tree, they soon had orchards
of many kinds of good Fruit—instead of the wild game
they soon had large numbers of Cattle, of horses of sheep
of hogs and other useful animals, and instead of
their forests in many places they had large fields of
Corn and other Grain, as also many other valuable
productions of the Earth Brothers
We hope your Eyes will be open to see clearly
the things which are best for you, and that you
will desire to pursue them—we are sure brothers, that it
is in the heart of your father the President of the Un-
ited States, to assist his red children in the cultivati-
on of the Earth, and to render them services which
will be greatly for their benefit and welfare. We hope
that your exertions to change your present mode of
living will be so plain to him that he will see them
which will encourage him to continue to aid you in
your endeavours Brothers
We have spoken plainly—we
desire to speak plain we will now tell you that we
have not come merely to talk, with you, we have come
prepared to render you a little service assistance—our
beloved brother Philip Dennis , who is now present has come
along with us, to cultivate for you a field of Corn, also
to shew you how to raise some of the other productions of
the Earth. He knows how to use the Plow, the Hoe, the Axe
and other implements of the husbandry Brothers
We will here ask you are you still desirous
to be assisted by us in the cultivation of the Earth? if
you say you are, our bother who we have just mentioned
will continue with you during the summer. We shall
leave it with you to shew him the spot where to begin
to work. Brothers he has left a farm—he has left a wife
and five small children who are very dear to him. He has
come from a sincere desire to be useful to our red brethren
brothers his motives are pure he will ask no reward from
you his greatest reward will be in the satisfaction he will
feel in finding you inclined to take hold of the
same tools which he takes hold of, to receive from him
instruction in the cultivation of your Lands and to
pursue the example he will set you Brothers
We hope you will make the situation of
our brother as comfortable as circumstances will admit
we hope also, that many of your young men will be
willing to be taught by him to use the plough, the
Hoe & other implements of husbandry—for we are sure
brothers, that as you take hold of such tools as
are in the hands of the white People, that you will
find them to be to you like having additional hands
you will also find brothers, that by using them, they
will enable you to do many things which without
them cannot be performed Brothers
There is one thing more which we
wish to add, your brothers the white people in order
to get their lands cultivated find it necessary that
their young men should be employed in it & not their
women. Women are less than men, they are not as
able to endure fatigue as men. It is the business of
our women to be employed in our houses, to keep
them clean, to sew, to spin, to knit, to weave, to dress
food for themselves and families, to make cloathes for
the men and the rest of their families, to keep the
cloathing of their families clean & to take care of
their children Brothers
We desire not to mention too
many things to you but we must add a little further
we are fully of the mind brothers that if you will
turn your attention to the cultivation of the Earth to
raising the different kinds of grain, to building comfort-
table dwelling houses for your families, to raising useful
animals, amongst others sheep for the advantage of the
wool in making cloathing, to raising flax and hemp
for your linen, and your Young women learn to
spin and weave, that your lives will be much easier
and happyer than at present, that you will be much
less exposed to diseases, and that your numbers will
increase and not diminuish. As we before observed
brothers your Land is good, it is far better than the
land the white people cultivate near the great water
we are persuaded that your land will produce dou-
ble the quantity of any kind of grain, of flax of hemp
with the same labour that is necessary near the
great water Brothers
We shall now finish what we
have to say with informing you that all the corn
and other productions of the Earth, which our brother
Philip Dennis may raise we wish our red brethren to
accept of as a token of our friendship and it is our
desire that the chiefs of the Pottowattomie and Miami
Nations who are now present added to our brothers
the Five Medals , Tuthinepee and Philip Dennis , make
such distribution of the same as they may think proper After which the Little Turtle made a reply
which was taken down in short hand as delivered and
is as follows Brothers
It appears to me necessary that I should
give you an immediate answer as you are about to
return to your families from whence you came Brothers & Friends
We are all pleased to see you here & to
take our brothers the Quakers through you by the
hand, we rejoice that the Great Spirit has appointed
that we should this day meet, for we believe that
this meeting will be of the utmost consequence
to your red brethren Brothers
What you have said we have carefully
gathered up we have placed it in our hearts in
order that it might be communicated to our posterity
--we are convinced that what you have said is
for the good of your red brethren, we are also convinced
that our chiefs and warriors, and our women & children
will be all of our opinion, and will be glad when they
hear what you have said Brothers
We take you now by the hand and through
you we take the people who sent you here by the hand
and assure you that we are pleased, that the Great
Spirit, has let us see each other, and converse together
upon the subjects which you have communicated to us Brothers
You see there is not a large number of us
here what you have said to us will not remain with
those who are here alone, it will be communicated to
all your red brethren in this country and I again repeat
that I am convinced they will be glad to hear what
you have said to us—to our women and to our children Brothers
When we saw you with the rest of our brothers
in Baltimore upwards of two years ago, I expect yo recollect
perfectly the conversation between us at that time and
place, I there with my brother chiefs told you, that
we were glad to find you, so much, disposed to assist us
and our women & children, we told you that your good
wishes should be make known to all your red brethren
in this country—this has been done Brothers
Ever since that time I as well as some other
of my brother chiefs have been endeavouring to turn
the minds of our people towards the cultivation of the
Earth but I am sorry to say we have not yet been able to
effect any thing Brothers
As many of our chiefs and principal
people are not present we could not now undertake to
give you any pointed answer. We expect in a few
moons there will be many of our people together at that
time it will be proper that we should return you an
answer to all the Subjects you now mention to us Brothers
The things you have said to us require our
greatest attention—it appears to be really necessary
we should deliberate upon them. In order to do so we
must beg you to leave the paper upon which they are
written that we may communicate them to our chiefs
when they assemble Brothers
All the things you have said to day were
certainly calculated for our good, you have enumerated
to us the different kinds of Grain, and animals we
ought to raise for our comfort, you have told us that
if we adopt the plan you propose, we should want
for nothing. This brothers myself and many of our
people believe is true and we hope we shall finally be
able to convince our young men that this is the
plan we ought to adopt to get our living Brothers
You have come a long distance to render
service to us we hope your visit will meet with the
success you wish, you have been very particular in
pointing out to us what will be for our good. You
have been very particular in pointing out to us the
duties of our women, and you have told us that
in adopting your mode of living, our numbers
would increase and not diminuish, in all this I
perfectly agree with you and I hope the other chiefs
will also Brothers
We are pleased to hear you say you are
going to leave one of your brothers with us to
shew us in what manner you cultivate the Earth
we shall endeavour brothers, to make his situation
amongst us as agreeable to him as will be possible
for us Brothers
We are convinced the plan you propose
will be highly advantageous to your red brethren—
we are convinced you have observed very justly, that
we shall not be so liable to sickness—we are certain
we shall then be able to make a more comfortable
living with less labour than at present and we hope
this will be the opinion of us all Brothers
I again repeat I am extremely glad to hear
the things you have said we will keep them in our
hearts for the good of our young men, our women &
our children. I have now delivered you th esenti-
ments of our people that are present
--Here he made a short pause then added— Brothers
Assure your people who sent you here, tell
your old chiefs, that we are obliged to them, for
their friendly offers to assist us in changing our present
mode of living—tell them it is a work that cannot
be done immediately, but that we are that way
disposed and we hope it will take place gradually. He then, set down for a short time—then proceeded Brothers
My heart is so overjoyed with what you
have said that I find I forgot to mention one of the
most important things. At the time we first met at
this place, the Five Medals and myself formed some
idea of your business, we expected, that you had come
to do for us things which you had proposed to us when
in Baltimore and consulted each other upon the
Answer necessary to return to you in every respect, and
I now find that our conjecture was right Brothers
The sentiments which I have delivered to
you were his sentiments, you have now told us that
your brother has a mind to live amongst us to
shew us how to cultivate the Earth and have desired
us to shew him the spot where to begin We agreed then that he should be at neither
of our villages least our younger brothers might be
jealous of our taking him to ourselves. We have
determined to place him on the Wabash whre some
of our families will follow him, where our young
men I hope will flock to him and where he will be
able to instruct them as he wishes This is all I have to say. I could all day
repeat the sentiments I have already expressed, also
how much I have been gratified in seeing and
hearing from our brothers, but this is not necessary
--I am sorry the chiefs of our Country are not all
present, that they might all hear what you have
said and have an opportunity to talk with you At the close of the conference we inf-
ormed the Indians that we wished to accompany
Philip Dennis to the river Wabash the place assigned for
him to commence his operations and requested them
to appoint one of their number to accompany us there
the Little Turtle replied that he would be pleased to
accompany us himself, but that he was too much
indisposed to go such a distance, they accordingly
appointed a guide, who together with William Wells 
accopanyed us. We were much pleased with the situation
of the place as also with the soil, it being equal in
fertility to any land in the western Country. Near it
are two good seats for Mills, one on the Wabash, with-
out injuring its navigation and the other on a 
handsome stream ½ a mile below. We may add
that this place is situated between 30 & 40 miles S.W. of
Fort Wayne, after viewing the Land adjacent, staking
out the place for Philip to build his house and pointing
out the place for him to clear and enclose &c &c we re-
turned to Fort Wayne On the 15 (having previously concluded to return
by Detroit and thence across the lake) we commenced our
journey homewards and descended the Miami of the
Lake to the ottoway river then down the same to Lake
Erie and thence to detroit, in this Distance we had an
opportunity of observing several Villages of the Shawanese
and Ottoway Indians as also several villages belonging
to the Wyandot (Huron) Indians one in particular at
 which we spent a little time contains about 100 families
and is known by the name of Browns Town & the Rock
--at this village they have made greater progress in
civilization than any other of the Western Indians—
They have comfortable dwelling houses, 200 head of Cattle
--make Butter & Cheese, have horses & Hogs, raise a sufficiency
of corn & oats &c &c we here saw one barn well filled with
wheat in the Straw, the land they cultivate is enclosed
under good fences & they have also Peach & apple orchards At this Village as well at several others, we were
informed that the Wyandots residing at Sandusky had
within a few years turned their attention to agricul-
ture, and had made considerable progress in fencing
in their Lands and in raising corn cattle &c On the 2nd of the 5th Mo. we left Detroit &
descended the streights into the Lake then across the
same to fort Erie in upper Cannada where we arrived
on the 10th then across the Niagara streights to
Buffaloe creek, where we engaged a conveyance to
Canandarque, whilst waiting for the conveyance we
visited the principal village of the Senneka Indians
situated on Buffaloe Creek, we saw several of their
principal chiefs and young men engaged in ploughing
--to one of these ploughs we saw 6 oxes—others were
busily engaged in cleaving and preparing land for
cultivation On the 13 we left Buffaloe Creek, continuing
our journey through the Genessee country to the head
of the Mohawk river—on our way we passed through
a large village of the Oneida Indians, then down the
Mohawk to Schenectady and from thence to Albany
where we took water for New York and from thence
by land to Baltimore where we arrived on the 27th. We further inform that some time after our
return, we received a letter from Philip Dennis dated
6 Mo 26 last which informs that he had been afflicted
5 weeks from the time we left him with a Sciatic
complaint so that it was with difficulty he could
go about, which has no doubt disabled him from do-
ing as much as he other ways would have done. He
informs that he had between 16 & 20 acres of land
enclosed under a substancial fence 8 rails high, and
that he had planted about 8 acres of corn, which
looked very well—since which we have received an-
other letter from him dated 8 Mo 26 which informs
that he has enjoyed a good state of health since he
had recovered from the complaint above mentioned
that his situation was a healthy one and that the
springs of water were very good—he further states that
his corn made an excellent appearance, having 2 & 3
Ears on a stalk that he had sown one acre in Tur-
nips which looked well, that a number of Indians
had been encamped near him for the purpose of
hunting, that only one family had setled perma-
nently at his station which onsisted on 7 grown persons
who he says have been industrious and attended to
his directions, that the Indians have been friendly &
some of them very sociable, and that 55 Eal river
Indians had been at his station, who acknowledged
that his corn was equal to any they had ever seen on
the Wabash. He also says he has had a conference
with Samuel the principal chief of the Eal river Indians
who informed him that he expects the Indians of his
village will settle at his station, and further informs
that they would gladly receive assistance from
Friends. Some farming utensils such as Plows, Hoes
& axes he says would be very acceptable. This chief
added that he does not expect they will make a
great progress immediately but thinks it a proper
time to lay a foundation for their children and is
in hopes the present establishment will make a
begining. Philip Dennis also informs, that when
he first went to the wabash he built a temporary
house 14 feet square and expected soon after the date
of his last letter to begin another to be 16 by 32 feet
and 1 ½ Stories high, and observes he very sensibly feel
the lonesomeness of his situation, but on reflecting upon
the business in which he is engaged and the
distressed situation of the poor Indians he feels no
cause of regret We also received a letter from Wm.
Wells Indian agent dated the 30th of the 6 Mo who
informs that the Indians agreeable to expectation
held their council in the 8th month and that 874
Indians attended The following is extracted from the minutes
of the proceedings June 13 1804
The council was opened
by the agent of Indians affairs who observed that he
was ready to receive any communications they might
wish to make. When a letter from the Society of
friends at Baltimore in Maryland was produced
read and interpreted wherein it appeared that
George Ellicott & Gerard T. Hopkins were appointed
to come and visit the Indians on their behalf a
written speech of the said George Ellicott & Gerard T. Hop-
kins was then produced read and interpreted to
all the different nations present, after some observations
made by Buckingchelas and the little Turtle the Council adjourned to tomorrow June 14 Council opened agreeable to
adjournment present the same as yesterday—after
several chiefs had spoken to different matters relative
to their Nations Toethteboxe spoke on behalf of the
Delawares thus Brothers
For many years before I came into the
world the white people have offered to us what you
now mention and it appears that our eyes were never
opened before now"—addressing himself to the Indians—
“my grandchildren listen to what I am now going
to say to our fathers. Three years ago we were invited
to a council at Vincennes by Governor Harrisson he
told us listen and I will speak about the way we
have been brought up, my brothers let us go together as
one people and we will hand to you our way of
living, I told him this was several times he had
mentioned this to us, now will take hold of it
and receive it. I told him we wanted it soon
as I was an old man and wanted to see it before
I died, if once I see it I will die in pleasure to
think I have left my women & children in comfort
one year ago from this my grand children the
Mohickenany came to renew their friendship with us
Hendricks told us they had brought what the white
people had put into their hands, when it was
given to us it gave us great pleasure and we thought
of our grandfathers and have brought it to you
one year ago Governor Harrisson at this place was
talking to us on the same subject. I told him I
had consented to it at Vincennes three years ago &
would never change my mind—now again
yesterday you have told us the same thing—I have
consented to it and will never alter my mind. I
have now answered you again I wish you to begin
immediately and afford us the assistance you offer
us by building us houses and fences after which we
can cultivate our Lands—I will never change my
mind—it is all I have to say Some others then spoke on different subjects when
the council adjourned until tomorrow June 15 Council opened, present
the same as yesterday. After several of the chiefs
had spoken on different subjects—The little Turtle 
spoke as follows To the Quakers of Baltimore
My Brothers & Friends
We were glad to see our friends
that came from you better than 2 moons ago, we
were glad to find it had pleased the great spirit
to keep you in the same mind you were in when
we spoke to you in Baltimore Brothers & Friends
I told you when you delived
your speech to us at this place I was sorry there
were not more of our people convened to hear you
I told you your brothers were thankful for the
Tools of agriculture you sent for us to the care
of William Wells . I told you my brothers, that
your talk should be delivered to all your red
brethren on their first meeting at this place Brothers
Your talk was delivered to us by
our friend Wm. Wells two days ago you will see
the answer to it of out grandfathers made yesterday
which informs you we are thankful for the kindness
you offer, and it is their wish you would continue
your kindness towards them. We the Miamies &
Pottowattomies also take you by the hand & assure
you we thank you for the goodness you have had in
offering to afford your red brethren assistance—a thing
they are so much in need of Brothers
The implements of husbandry that you
sent to this place have been all distributed by the
person you sent them to expect 2 ploughs which he
now offers to any of us who will make use of
them. We hope some of our people will be disposed
to use them Brothers
You have been particular in
pointing out to us what we ought to do for
our own good—we are convinced that if we
adopt the mode of living you propose to us
it will be for our own good—still brothers
we find it impossible to make this change
immediately and although a number of our
young men now laugh at the Idea. Still
brothers, this does not discourage us and we hope it will
not discourage you from continuing your friendship towards
us—we know the time is not far from us that will
compel us to adopt the mode of living you propose Brothers & Friends
Our friend you left amongst us
to instruct us in the use of the tools you gave us, is
now at the place we assigned him. Though it was
late when Philip Dennis commenced his work, still we
are convinced it will be for the service of your
brothers and although we are unable to say what sort of
a crop he will raise, yet let it be good or bad it will
be of service to us & when ever our brother informs
us he is done his work and ready to return we will
attend to the distribution of the corn agreeable to your
request Brothers & Friends
These are the sentiments of your
red brethren that compose this council, we all take
you by the hand and hope that the great spirit, will
always keep your minds disposed to serve your red bre-
thren, should you have any communications to make to
us you know the mode of sending them to us William Wells informs in his letter that
the Delawares Miamies and Eal river Indians have
agreed that the United States should send suitable
men amongst them to instruct them in building
Houses, making fences & instead of giving them their
yearly Annuities in goods and he says in a letter rec.
from him dated the 31st of the 8th Mo. that he is only
waiting the directions of the Secretary of War to put
 the plan in execution, and gives it as his opinion it
will be of the greatest bennefit to the Indians to
keep one or Two good white men at each Village
to work with them and to advise and assist them they
to receive a salary equal to their work and what
they raise to be divided amongst the Indians of the
Village and adds, that this plan will give room for the
United States as well as the Society of Friends to shew the
Indians how much they have their happiness at heart. He also observes that the Eal river Indians (a tribe 
 of the Miami Nation) intend to settle on the wabash 
at Dennis’ station. From the foregoing the committee may form 
an opinion of the situation & disposition of the Mi- 
-ami Delaware & Eal river Indians — from what we 
observed & from information received whilst in the 
Indian Country, but little can very soon be expected 
from the Pottowattomies and the other nations of 
Indians residing to the N. & W of them they being 
more remote from the white setlers and their country 
better for fishing and hunting they do not feel the 
same necessity to turn their attention to the cultivation 
of the Earth The committee may observe by the 
speech of Toethteboxhe that the Delawares are desirous 
of assistance — We frequently whilst amongst the 
Indians were informed that as much may be expected 
from them as from any of the Indians — many of 
them from having formerly near the white setlers in 
in Pennsylvania speak our language and are par- 
-tial to our manners and customs We were also informed that the shawanese re- 
-siding on the Auglaize river are making some 
progress in civilization we were told that some of 
them had 40 head of cattle and make butter & chuse The Delawares Miamies & Eal river Indians 
requesting of the government to have their annuities
 
in the amount thereof expended in the employment 
of suitable men to assist them in building comfortable 
dwelling houses and making fences &c. we apprehended 
plainly shews their disposition — Under all circumstances 
we are of the sentiment that there is cause of encou- 
-ragement to Friends and think with the Little Turtle 
as expressed in his reply to our address that their 
changing their present mode of living is a work 
that cannot be done immediately, but that a number 
of the Indians are that way disposed and we hope it 
will take place gradually. Geo. Ellicott 
 10 Mo 16 1804 Gerard J. Hopkins Which being read the committee generally 
expressed their satisfaction and concurance with their 
proceedings. The following friends are appointed to examine 
the Treasurers acct. and prepare a report to be laid 
before the yearly meeting and produce it to a future 
siting of the committee to wit George Ellicott Gerard T. 
Hopkings, Evans Thomas , Thomas Moore , Edward Stabler & 
Philip E. Thomas It appearing to the committee that a corres- 
pondence being opened with the friends under appoint- 
ment of the Yearly Meeting of Philadelphia on Indian 
concerns would tend to promote the object of our mu- 
tual concern the following friends are therefore app- 
-ointed to prepare a communication to them and
produce it to a future meeting of the committee to
wit Geo Ellicott , Edward Stabler , Caleb Bentley , Andrew
Ellicott Jr. & Isaac Tyson Then adjourned to the 9th hour tomorrow
morning 10 Mo 17 1804 The committee again met present 14 Members The friends appointed to prepare a report to the
Yearly meeting produced the following to wit 10 Mo 17 1804 To the Yearly Meeting now siting The committee on Indian concerns report, that a
letter was received by them from the Little Turtle & the
Five Medals chiefs of the Miami & Pottowattomi nations
of Indians and others dated 2 Mo. 5 1804, stating that
they had received the implements of husbandry which
had been sent them by friends and that they should
be put into the hands of such of their people as would
be willing to use them. It also noticed that the
President of the United States had prohibitted the
introduction of spiritous liquors amongst them
which they say the best thing he could do for his
red children, and concluded by expressing a hope
that the Great Spirit would permit some of us to
make them a visit in order to shew them how to use
the Tools sayin they did not know how to begin The committee upon solidly considering
the subject were united in judgement that a visit to
them would be the best means to obtain a knowledge
of their disposition & appointed Geo. Ellicott Gerard
T. Hopkins, Joel Wright & Elisha Tyson to that service
and requested them to proceed therein as soon as conve-
nient—they were also authorised to take one or more
suitable persons with them to reside amongst the Indi-
ans, to instruct them in agriculture & other useful
arts. The two first named friends attended to the
service and produced the following report—
[For which see their report Page 71 & sequel] We have also examined our treasurers acc.
and find a balance remaining in his hands of $402 29/100

present 7 Members The friends appointed to prepare a com-
munication to the committee on Indian concerns
under appointment of the Yearly Meeting of Phi-
ladelphia produced the following which was approved
and directed to be signed & forwarded by the clerk To the Committee on Indian affairs app-
ointed by the Yearly Meeting of Philadelphia
Dear Friends The committee on Indians concerns
appointed by the Yearly Meeting of Baltimore
being of opinion that a reciprocal advantage
would arrise and their wishes be promoted by
a free correspondence with other committees of
the same nature have for this reason written to
you at the present time and also being fully
persuaded that the great work we have in hand
may be better accomplished by an union of
sympathy & sentiment, than perhaps it could by
either committee alone In the progress of the arduous undertaking
of assisting the Indian natives in agriculture &
other useful arts of civil life this committee
have sent several deputations of its members
into their Country first to ascertain their disposi-
tions & wants & after that to render them such
assistance & instruction as was in our power, &
we have the satisfaction to inform that from
the report of the last of those deputations, our
efforts are like to be crowned with as much success
as (from the means in our power to employ) we had
reason to expect. That a number of the Indians
appear very much inclined to cultivate the Earth &
no longer depend on their accustomed precarious
mode of procuring subsistence The different Nations or tribes of Indians
inhabiting the country N.W. of the river Ohio are num-
rous & much dispersed in their situations, amongst
them are these that have fallen under our particular
notice. The Delaware Nation now inhabit the
same Country but were originally from the
shores of the Delaware river and respecting whom a
committee who went into their Country about 5 years
since were requested to make some enquiry on behalf of
the Indian committee of Philadelphia. These this com-
mittee have considered as coming more properly under
your notice By information received from our last deputation
the Delawares are now very much disposed to receive
such information and assistance as their white brethren
may be disposed to render them, this appears to be the
 decided determination of the most antient & influential
of their chiefs and the much increasing wish of their
young men. This nation are numerous & compactly
setled on the white river a branch of the Wabash
distant about 100 Miles west from the settlement of Friends
on the miamie We may also inform you that from information
which we have received, the Delaware, Miamie & Eal river
nations are entitled to an annuity from government
of 1000 dollars each, which has hitherto been paid to
them in goods. They have requested at their last
Council that this sum may be expended in the
employment of suitable persons to instruct them
in the arts of civil life. The Wyandots have also
requested, that their annuity may be paid them in
young Cattle, this information is pleasing to us, as
it in a considerable degree shews the sincerity of
their professions of willingness to abandon their present
mode of life for one from which every comfort may
be expected with much greater certainty We may Remark also that we at the present
time have only given assistance to the Miami & Eal
river Nations and from the limited state of our
friends, we are fearful we shall not be competent
to extend it as far as might be desirable, amongst
many of the other Nations. With a hope that our mutual efforts
may be productive of the desirable end we are
aiming at we are your friends

Balt. 10 Mo. 17. 1804 Information having been received by the committee
that Tarhie the principal chief of the Wyandot nation
of Indians had some time since forwarded Speech
& Belt of Wampum to us and that he not having
since received any answer to it was become very uneasy
and extremely anxious to hear from us. The following
friends are therefore appointed to prepare an address to
him on the subject and produce it to a future siting
of the committee to wit George Ellicott & Philip E. Thomas 
Adjourned to the 7th hour, tomorrow evening 10 Mo 18 1804 
The committee again met pursuant to adjournment The clerk informed that the Minutes and
proceedings of the former committee under appoint-
ment of the yearly meeting on Indian concerns, which
had come into his hands were in such a disordered state
that he found it impossible to arrange them & requested
an appointment of some friends to assist him therein
the following friends are therefore nominated & requested
to furnish him the necessary aid to wit Isaac Tyson 
& John Ellicott & directed to report to a future
meeting of the committee The friends appointed to prepare an address to
Tarhie produced the following which was approved &
directed to be signed & forwarded to wit To Tarhie & the other principal chiefs of the
Wyandot Nation of Indians 
Brothers You may remember that something
more than 5 years ago a committee of Quakers from
Baltimore made you a visit at Sandusky and that
as a sufficient number of chiefs could not speedily
be got together at that time you declinged giving
a full answer to the communication then made you Brothers
You may also remember that as you
could not at that time give us a full answer
you promised to forward it after the meeting of the
grand Council which was to be held shortly after Brothers
Your brethren the Quakers of Baltimore
have ever since that time been waiting to receive
this answer and could not account for its not coming
to hand, they concluded therefore that you declined
receiving the assistance that they were willing to
have renderd you Brothers we have just now heard from some
of our friends who live on Little Beaver to whom
Tarhic communicated it last winter that you did
forward an answer to the communication, made to
you at Sandusky 5 years since, and we are sorry to in-
form you from some unknown cause it has not come
to hand Brothers
As we had not received your answer, and
thinking you did not wish our assistance, we have
since that period turned our minds to assist some other
nations of our Red brethren Brothers
We wish you to forward to us as soon as
you can a copy of the answer to our communication
which has miscarried in order that we may know your
sentiments on the subject

Present 16 Members The friends appointed at last meeting to
assist the clerk in arranging the minutes of the late
committee under appointment of the Yearly meeting
on Indian concerns report that they have attended to
the service and that all the minutes as far as they
could be collected are correctly recorded,--they are released Adjourned to the 7th hour tomorrow evening 2 Mo 4 —The committee
again met present 18 Members The sub-committee produced the following
report To the Committee on Indian concerns We the Sub-committee appointed to act in the
recess of this committee, inform, that since the report
made by the friends who visited the Indians, our friend
Philip Dennis who remained with them during the past
season has returned with them during the past
season has returned. He informs us that he spent
the season agreeably with them and was favoured
to enjoy a good portion of health whilst there—
He raised 400 bushels of corn but this was not divided
when he left that Country on account of the dispersed
situation of the Indians, he had however secured it
in substantial well covered cribs, and had engaged
William Wells to attend with the chiefs appointed
to make the distribution & has no doubt but it will
be equitably divided on the return of the Indians
from their hunting Camps. He also raised Turnips
Potatoes, Cucumbers, Water Melons, Pumpkins, Beans
Parsnips & other garden vegetables and left at the
farm he had been cultivating (with the family of
Indians with whom he resided) 23 Hogs & Pigs 7 of which
were in good order to kill, and would weigh 1500 lbs
these he engaged William Wells to attend to the
killing & Salting of they were small when brought to
the farm in the spring and had no other food than
what they gathered in the woods. He also built a
house 32 feet long & 17 feet wide 1 ½ stories high, with
floors and partitions—one end of which he finished He further informs that the Indians who remained
with him were very industrious and attended to his directions
that the young women wished to work out in preparing the
ground and in tending the corn from which he had
dissuaded them. And as some spinning wheels had just
arrived at Fort Wayne which had been sent on by
government he had encouraged these young women to
go there and learn to spin & knot of a woman that
happened to be there—this they did and soon learned
both to spin & knit and that he left them knitting yarn
of their own spinning and gives it as his opinion that
there is encouragement for friends to persevere. A
considerable number of Eal river Indians are about to
settle near the place he cultivated. This being it that
country has been attended with considerable expence but
should another person go out to them the disbursement
need not be as great a considerable piece of land being
now enclosed and a house built. He also informs that
one of his horses died a few days before he left that country
and that previous to his departure he was with a number
of principal Indian chiefs who requested him to
inform friends that they and the Indians generally were
much obliged to friends for the assistance they had given
them, and hoped we would continue our friendship
towards them and that nothing might happen to
discourage us, he also says that all the Indians he was
amongst were very friendly as was also William Wells 
& the other offices of the government We further inform the committee that we
have setled with Philip Dennis and reimbursed him
for the loss of his house, we have also setled with the
Treasurer and find in his hand a ballance of $273 63/100 Evan Thomas Elisha Tyson Geo. Ellicott P. E. Thomas Baltimore 2 Mo. 4 1805 As it appears that the Indians are still desirous
of friends continueing their care towards them and of
our sending a person to take the place of Philip Dennis 
the committee after weightily considering the subject
conclude to instruct the sub-committee to endeavour
to procure one or more suitable offer to agree with them
and call on the Treasurer for the expences that may
be incured No further business appearing at this time
the committee adjourns to meet on the 7th day
preceeding our next quarterly meeting at the 7th hour
in the evening Baltimore 10 Mo. 15 1805 At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
Concerns present 16 Members and our friends Jacob
Lindley, John Hunt & John Shoemaker Jr. from
Pennsylvania The sub-committee produced the following
report To the Committee on Indian Concerns In compliance with what appeared
to be the sense of the Committee when last con-
vened, we endeavoured to procure a suitable Friend
to go and reside amongst the Indians the present
season but no suitable one having offered to engage
in the service and taking into consideration the
advanced season of the year and the dissatisfied &
unsetled situation of the Indians at that time on
account of a sale of Land that had been made
by some of the tribes to the United States (which
uneasiness we are glad to hear has since been
removed) our thought it might for the present
season be best to write to William Wells Indian
agent and request him to procure for Friends the
most suitable person he could who under his directionwould assist them in ploughing &c and accord-
ingly we addressed the following letter to him Baltimore 3 Mo 10 1805
William Wells 
Esteemed Friend As members of a committee
on Indian concerns appointed by the Society of
Friends we address thee, and inform that our desire
to promote the civilization, and add to the happiness
of the Indians has not abated, and inasmuch as
we made some progress in this interesting under-
taking by cultivating for them a field of Corn
&c the last year we are desirous not yet to abandon
it. It has been our wish to send a person to
take the place of Philip Dennis in aiding the
Indians the present season but the information we
have received of the unsetled and dissatisfied situation of
the Indians added to the difficulty of finding a suitable
character willing at this time to engage in the
service, has been such that from the already advanced
period in the Spring, we have no hope of succeeding, and
after a full conference on the subject we have come
to the conclusion to ask of thee (in addition to the
many kindness we have to acknowledge we have
received) the favour of interesting thyself to procure
for us the most suitable character in thy power who
under thy direction will plough the land which
Philip Dennis cultivated the last season and plant
it in Corn, in the performance of which, we hope he
will be assisted by the Indians—after their corn is
planted we are willing to believe they will be able
to mannage it should a second ploughing however
be necessary we wish that also to be done, this
person may also prepare for them a garden of the
most useful vegetables, which they may afterwards
easily mannage, of the descriptions we leave thee
to judge. This little service rendered to them
the present year we hope will convince the
Indians that we have not withdrawn our regard
from them, the expence involved in a compliance
with the request which we have now made of
thee we will cheerfully pay and should it be
practicable to do for them what we propose
we have to request of thee, the favour of informing
the Indians that the work which we now do for
them, is a small token of the continuance of our
love for them and that we hope that the attention
they gave last summer to the mannagement of
Philip Dennis in cultivating a crop for them has
afforded them much instruction in the use of the
Plough and other implements of Husbandry We hope there will be a continuance of our
correspondence and that from time to time we shall
be favoured with such information from thee
relative to our Indian Brethren as will be interesting
to us
Thy friends Evan Thomas Geo. Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins We have since received his Answer in which he
says he will loose no time in complying with
the request of the Committee and that he will
at all times be ready to put the benevolent concern
of Friends towards the Indians in execution, he
also says that at this time a spirit of industry exists
amongst the Indians generally, and that as several
of the Tribes had requested of Government to have
a part of their annuities expended in the employ-
ment of men to split rails and make fences for them
the Delawares had 23.000 rails put up into fences the
last winter—and that 40.000 more would be made
into fences for the Miamies and Eal river Indians
by the 1st of the 6 Month, he adds that 10 families
of the Miamies have setled adjoining the place
that was cultivated by Philip Dennis and that
4 Men were now employed in making rails to
fence in 40 Acres for them and also that 3 persons more
were at work for the Eal river Indians ½ a mile
below Dennis’ Station—that they had 25 Acres cleard
and ready for the Plough and he expects would have
50 or 60 Acres fenced in by the 1st fo the 6 Mo. He
further adds that he is not certain what number
of families will reside at that place but expects 25
the present season and he is confident the settlement
will increase very fast. The Indian that worked
all last season with Philip Dennis was about
building himself a comfortable house and had about
2 acres more of Ground cleared and was ploughing
in the field that was cleared by Philip Dennis —the
Hogs that were left there had increased to 100 in
number William Wells further informs that there would
be 100 Acres of Land under good fence at the Little
Turtles Town (15 Miles north of Dennis’ Station) by the
1st of the 6 Mo.—that they had obtained a large number
of Hogs and some Cows and he doubts not but
the Indians will soon see, that it is easier to raise
food than to procure it by Hunting and adds
that Friends may see by the very great progress they
have made in agriculture & civilization since Philip Dennis was amongst them
that they only want good men to reside amongst
them to teach them how to work We expected to have received information from
him giving an account of the progress the Indians
are making this summer but have not yet heard

appointed by the Yearly Meeting of Baltimore
Dear Friends Your acceptable Epistle of the
10 Mo last, was not for a considerable time after
its date produced to our committee, occasioned
by a lengthy suspension of their meeting. Your exertions
for the instruction of the Miamie & Eal river
Indians in agriculture was noticed with much
satisfaction. That you may be encouraged to
persevere in a work confessedly arduous, yet promise-
ing such essential bennefis to our Red brethren
is earnestly desired, being persuaded that the religious
concern of Society, for the improvement & welfare
of this people, originated in motives truely benevolent
and under best influence, so are we of the mind
as we move therein under wise direction, that
the work will be, as we think it has been owned
and blessed. Our labours on behalf of the Indians have
yielded as much solid peace as most services in
which we have been engaged, and what particularly
claims our thankful commemoration, after some
trial of our faith and patience, waiting for suitable
characters to reside amongst the Indians, such
have come forward measurably under the weight
of the concern, and voluntarily offerin their services
producing certificates of the concurrence of the Monthly
Meetings of which they were members For your information we herewith forward 20
Copies of a publication intended for the members
of our yearly Meeting, containing a brief account
of our proceedings—our views do not yet extend
beyond those tribes of Indians with whom we are
at present engaged, not knowing what may open
in the clearness hereafter. We are of your mind
that a free intercourse and correspondence, maintained
between your committee and ours, as occasions
arise, may be beneficial to the important business
entrusted to us Signed on behalf of the Committee on

duced A report from our committee on Indian
concerns was now produced, which being read
and considered, much satisfaction with their
proceedings was expressed, inasmuch as it very
evidently appeard that considerable benefits to
our Red brethren have already resulted, since
the care of the Yearly Meeting towards them

such exertions in the prosecution of this
important concern as may be in their
power to extend and our subordinate Meetings
were affectionately desired to be liberal in their
contributions and from time to time forward their
collections to Elias Ellicott Treasurer of the Committee
so that the necessary means may be furnished in
order to the further prosecution of the Concern. The
committee were also left at liberty to have printed
for the more general information of Friends
as many copies of their report connected with

 At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian Concerns
present 13 members The following communication from Tarhie (the Crane) 
Rohshawoh (walk on the Water) Yonierro (the Crow) and others
on behalf of the Wyandot Nation of Indians, was
produced and read Brethren Quakers listen! Some time since a committee of
seven men were sent to us by your Society at Baltimore
--the occasion of their coming was to attend to the
business we were speaking of when I was at Baltimore
the next spring there were letters sent out and the com-
mittee came out least the letters should have been
lost, that they might communicate the same things
sent in them, i e Brothers
The reasons of our coming are we not
knowing but that the letters might be lost, for in
those letters, were contained all the information;
How it happened when we got first acquainted with
the Dellaware Nation your Nephew, now our design
is to do something for the Delaware & Wyandot Nations
as we love them more than any others, at the same
time we express our friendship for all Nations; The
Quakers have taken up a plan for doing something
for the Delaware and Wyandot People. As you have
two fathers, the President of the United States and
King of England, who give you presents every year
--the President gives 1000 $ annually, we have a design
to go on the same footing, and give $1000 a year, if
the chiefs our Brothers would accept of it. We tell
you brothers we want to take care of you and give
you good things, the goods we shall give you are
of our own make, they will be good and of more
value than those the President gives, if the chiefs com-
ply with our offer we desire them to come to Balt.
as you know that place; if the chiefs find it too
difficult for them to come to Baltimore, we wish
them to write an answer back to us as soon as
they can and deliver the letter to Zane’s Ville to
William MCulloh , or at Wheeling to Col. Zane 
they will take the letters safe for they are Quakers. We
wish the Delaware and Wyandot Nation, and all
the other Nations not to harbor any suspicion, of
our wanting to get any of your land, or receive any
payment in money or any other way, we do it our
of compassion Brothers for you, it has been medi-
tated on ever since the Treaty of Grenville, we have
also got the Presidents permit,--These matters are setled
and we have now got $100 on hand towards building
you a Mill, we will also help you in cultivating
your lands and in building houses—another thing
brothers we wish you to send some of your children
to us, and we will school them and give them learning
as the Wyandots are the only Nation that have no
learned men amongst them, the parents of the
children may choose what their children shall learn
either for Council of for Religion or to Trade This is all we understood was offered to us as
explained by out interpreter Robert Armstrong . My
answer then was, that I would not give you an answer
until I went to see the Brown’s Town chiefs, which
should be done in the course of that summer, the
chiefs when we met thought it too difficult to go
they desired me to write on to you, and what
ever I did they would agree to Brethren Quakers give attention!
I send a few words
to you now; the plan you have thought of is
a very good one, and all the chiefs thank you for
having compassion on us, for we are poor & needy,
but there is one difficulty in the way, your res-
pecting two Nations, more than the rest, we say,
the difficulty with the chiefs is your respecting, two
nations more than the rest—other nations might
look upon us with envy, and as they are not men of
knowledge, they might fall on us and cut us off
this is the only difficulty in the way we wish
our brethren Quakers to consider this matter, &
the danger we shall be in, and if they are deter-
mined to help us to send us word in the spring early
and also to see how many nations they will help
if you send on in the spring and are still de-
termined to help us, we shall then have matters
regulated and will accept your offer Brothers!
We have both been under the same diffi-
culty it is five years since the brethren were here
and I have heard no word, and finally concluded
that they had given up doing any thing, until
this letter came into my hands—we all thank
you heartily for not giving it up altogether. In
regard to the letter now before us, the chiefs at
Brown’s Town are pleased and accept the offer, we
now leave it with our brethren if they conclude to
help us either to send us another letter, and give
us notice or send the things they propose, we wish
four pair of plow Irons at this place Brethren!
If you see fit to send a letter this fall
or early in the spring, or to send on your things di-
rectly, we leave the matter with yourselves. In
regard to schools Brethren, by that time some of
our people will determine on the children, they
will send to school and what they shall study The chiefs return you thanks that you have
not given over helping them and are now willing to
accept your offer, the ground of our accepting your offer
is, that we believe as you are a progressing
people, and mention the name of God in your
offer, you will not act the Hypocrite and deceive
us Brethren!
We desire you to do your best, we
have chosen our father that is here present to
write this speech and take it on to some of
the Quakers Brethren!
We believe he will take it safe
you know the custom, in taking speeches from
the Quaker chiefs, that satisfaction should be
given, we desire you to do it—you say you
count us as dear own brethren, we do not think
you will take it hard in paying our father for
his labour in carrying it Signed Tarhic—or Crane Rohshawoh—Turtle Yonierro—Crow 
Hampton Northup Interpreter N. B. I was desired by the chiefs to add, that if
their brethren the Quakers, should send them Plow Irons
they would also send two yoke of oxen to plow with

By Joseph Badger It being evident that the views of Friends
towards their Nations have been greatly misre-
presented, and no such letter as they appear to
have received ever having been addressed to them
by us, their communication is refered to the sub-
Committee who are directed to write them a
suitable reply to it A letter was received from William Wells dated
10 Mo 4 1805—in which he says Agreeably to the
directions of the committee, I have employed a man
to assit the Indians in cultivating the field on the
Wabash which was cleared and cultivated by Phi-
lip Dennis last year, the Indians with this mans
assistance have raised, it is supposed at least 600
bushels of good corn, from this one field exclu-
sive of what they have raised from ground of
their own clearing Many of the oldest of the Eel river & Weas
Indians, have removed and setled at that place
where they will be followed by the younger branches
of their Tribes in the ensuing spring He adds believing as I do that the Society of
Friends are desirous of ameliorating the situation
of their Red Brethren in this Country, I will take
the liberty to observe that the present is a very
favourable time, to put in execution, their be-
nevolent views towards the distressed Natives of
this land and that much good may be done on
the Wabash by sending one or two suitable men
to reside amongst the Indians, and teach them
how to raise stock and cultivate the Earth, Wit-
ness what Philip Dennis effected amongst them
the last year, at a station where he had every
thing to begin, there are now at least 400 Hogs
and 20 Cows, and the Indians at no village in
this Country live so comfortably as those at
that place. If this spirit of industry is kept
alive for a few years it will certainly have a
powerful influence on the minds of the Indians
at many of the neighboring Villages. The
Indians have lately, concluded a treaty with
the United States which has setled all their
jarring interests After a solid consideration of the subject
the sub-committee were directed to endeavour to
engage one or two suitable characters to go our
and remain the succeeding summer with the
Indians for the purpose of instructing them in
agriculture at the settlement on the Wabash
and call on our Treasurer for the Amount of
expences that may be incured Then Adjourned Baltimore 8 Mo 3 1806 At a meeting of the Committee on Indian
concerns present 14 Members The Sub-committee informed that they had
agreeably to the instructions of this committee at
our meeting in the 2nd Month last, returned the
following answer to the communication at that
time received from the chiefs of the Wyandot and
Delaware Nations of Indians to wit To Tarhic , Roshawoh , Yoniero and other
chiefs of the Wyandot & Delaware nations of Indians
Brothers We have just received a speech from
you dated at upper Sandusky July 27th 1805 Brothers!
We are sorry to perceive by this speech
that our intentions towards you have been greatly
misrepresented—we suppose the interpreters between
us did not understand our language suffice-
ently well to explain to you our meaning
as we have not written any letter conveying to you the
offers you mention, nor has any person authorized
by us, ever held out any such proposals, as
you appear to think you have received—the only
letter we ever wrote to you, we herewith send you
an exact copy of, by reading of it you will see
the reasons why we have not given you more assis-
tance Brothers!
The misrepresentations which have
been made to you, renders it necessary for
us, at this time, to explain our views and pros-
pects at large towards you, that may not any
longer be deceived, or hereafter suppose, we have
held out any expectations to you, which it
was not our intention to have realized Brothers!
About Ten years ago when many of
your brethren the Quakers, were assembled in their
great council to transact the affairs of their
society we believed that the great Spirit put
it into our hearts to endeavour to do something
towards the assistance of our Indian Brethren
who we believed suffered much for the want of
food and cloathing by not knowing how to cultivate
their lands and make cloathes for themselves as
the white people do, we therefore appointed some
of our brethren to take such of our red brothers by
the hand as would be willing to be instructed
by us in the use of the Plow, the Hoe and other
Tools employed by us in raising corn and other grain Brothers
These of our brethren soon after bean
to look round and see which of the Indian Nations
would be most likely to be willing to receive
instruction from us, we had not at that time
any particular prospects exclusively towards any
Tribe or nation, we felt them all as brethren
whom we loved, and were disposed to assist as far
as our power extended either of them whom we
might find willing to accept of our aid Brothers!
After having visited several Indian
families of the Wyandot and Delaware Nations
and informed them of our intentions, we received
about 7 years ago a speech from our brother Tarhic 
delivered at Detroit on behalf of the Wyandot
and Delaware Nations in which we were invited
to attend at San Dusky the next summer and
talk together on the subject of assisting you Brothers
Seven of us accordingly at the time ap-
pointed made a visit to San Dusky and in a
Council which they then had with Tarhic at his
own house, with two other chiefs and many hun-
ters, we told you that it had arrisen in our
hearts, to try and afford you some assistance in
teaching you how to cultivate your lands & make
clothing, in reply our brother Tarhic informed us
on behalf of himself and the other chiefs present
that they could not give us any answer at that
time, but would in a general council of their
chiefs and people consult together and send a
written answer to us as soon as you came to a
conclusion amongst yourselves Brothers
We have never since that time
until now received any direct communication
from you—after having waited three years
 we were discouraged and thought you had
declined accepting any assistance from us
therefore turned our attention towards some
other Nations, who we knew were willing &
anxious to receive help from us Brothers
Having now entered into engagements
with our brothers the Miamies and some others
it is not in our power to extend much aid
to you at this time, we have not the means
of giving a great deal, and having promoted
a settlement on the Wabash river of such of
our Red Brethren as were willing to be ins-
ructed by us in agriculture we feel ourselves
engaged to give them further assistance—we
hope they will before a great while, by industry
and care learn to do without much of our
help, as their father the President of the United
States and the Secretary of War we know are
disposed to render these and the whole of their
other Red Children all the assistance in their
power, in making their situations more comforta-
ble, and we hope the support they will
continue to receive from them will release us
from the necessity of furnishing our aid at that
place much longer Brothers
Should this be the case and our
brethren of the Wyandot Nation at upper San
Dusky continue disposed to receive help from
us we will probably hereafter turn our attention
more towards relieving them, for we still con-
tinue to feel as much love for them as when we
first offered them our aid and have only been
prevented from helping them, by not having
heard from them before now, which made us
suppose they did not wish it Brothers
We have concluded to request our
friend Charles Jewitt Indian Agent at Detroit
to furnish you with 2 setts of Plow Irons 12 Axes &
12 Hoes on our behalf as a small token of the
continuance of our love for you these we hope
you will receive, and put them into the hands of
such of our Red Brethren of the Wyandot Nation
as will be willing to use them Signed on behalf of the Society of Quakers

 Evan Thomas Geo. Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins P E Thomas The sub-committee further informed that they had
engaged William Kirk (at 35$ per Mo) and his brother
Mahlon Kirk (at 25$ per Mo) to go out and reside
amongst the Indians on the Wabash the present
summer they forwarded by them a letter to William
Wells, and an address to the Indians of which the

Esteemed Friends Thy several communications
upon Indian concerns, we have received. The
information given us has been acceptable, and we
desire to make our acknowledgements therefor This will be handed to thee by William Kirk 
who is one of our committee and is accompanyed
by his younger Brother Mahlon Kirk , the object of
their journey is to spend the ensueing summer in
aid of the Red people. By them we have also directed
a communication to the Little Turtle & other chiefs
which will be put into thy hands. We have left a
blank for the addition of the names of other
chiefs, which we wish thee to fill up at thy discretion
not doubting but that there are several in the
neighbourhood of Dennis’ station, who have removed
to reside thereabouts, in latter time, to whom a
respect is due from us Our young men will upon all occasions advise
with thee upon the important objects of their visit
Thy willingness to promote our benevolent purposes
we have in time past fully proven, and have no
hesitation in believing that thy best exertions will
be used to further our views towards the Indians
any attention paid to our young men will be
particularly acknowledged by us, and whatever
expences may be incured through thy agency on
their and our account we will cheerfully pay In a letter lately received from thee, we
notice a description of sundrey tools necessary for
the Indians, we are obliged for the information, the
season is now perhaps too far advanced for them
to be made and forwarded in time, to be useful
the present summer, we shall however not neglect
the information We hope to receive continued proofs of thy
interest in our undertaking by the reception of
such accounts from time to time as may be in thy
power to furnish us With our best wishes for thy welfare and the
welfare of our worthy young men, we remain with
sincere respect Thy friends

Brothers and Friends It has been very pleasing to
us, to be informed of the progress made by our
Red brethren in the cultivation of the Earth.
You remember, brothers, we have before told you
that amongst other advantages, the cultivation
of the Earth will lead you to have fixed homes
that you will build comfortable dwelling Houses
and will live in ease and plenty—All this we
hope you are begining to see is true—As a
proof of the continuance of our sincere desire
for your welfare, we now send to succeed Philip
Dennis Two of our beloved young men, William
Kirk who is one of our committee and his brother
Mahlow Kirk , to reside with you during the
summer, They are desired by us to render you all
the assistance and information in their power, in
order to promote your welfare. We believe bro-
thers, that you will make their situation a-
mongst you as comfortable as circumstances will
admit of and hope that you will be disposed to
regard the instruction which they may offer you
as being calculated to promote your real interests Brothers—We hope that many of your people, will
be disposed to join our young men in taking
hold of the plough, the Hoe, the Axe, and other
implements of husbandry, so that the production
of the Earth under the blessing of the great Spirit
may be made abundant and the next Winter be
a winter in which your Cabbins may be filled with
plenty. Having nothing further to add at present we conclude with the expression of sincere desires
for the welfare of your chiefs and old men—your
young Men—your Women & your children

Friends In the latter end of last Month I
had the honor to receive a packet from the
Secretary at War, enclosing your address to the
Wyandot Indians, and your letter of 2 Mo. 20 to
Charles Jewitt . The Secretary at War directed me to
do the same with your address and letter as C.
Jewitt would have done, if he had been here, who
is in the public service as Indian Agent at
Chickago The Chiefs of the Wyandots at &
near San Dusky to whom your communication
appears to be immediately addressed are not ofter
at Detroit, they have not been here since me
came to this place in june last, but there are
chiefs of that Nation, residing a little below
Detroit on the Western Shore of Lake Erie, in two
Villages called Maguaga and Browns Town who
are often here. The most considerable and res-
pectable part of that Nation live in those two
Villages, where also resides the public Interpreter for
that Nation. I have conferred with this Inter-
preter and these Chiefs, who rejoice in the con-
contemplation of your goodness and kind thoughts
towards the Indians and would gladly accept of your
profered aid. But I have doubts whether it would
meet your purpose to bestow the bounty you mention
on this part of the Wyandot Nation, inasmuch
as your address is directed to those at San Duskey
I should be glad of information from you on
this point. Give me leave to inform you, that
those Wyandots of the two Villages before mentioned
are a very deserving people, temperate, sober, reli-
gious in their way and have already become
agriculterists in part, but need aid and encoura-
gement, with which I have no doubt they would soon
quit the hunting life altogether, and advance ra-
pidly to a state of compleat civilization. Indeed
from what I have seen in this people I am greatly
confirmed in a favourite opinion long entertained
by me, that the Indians are capable of becoming
as well civilized as any people in the world. The
Indians now in question are very anxious to make
further advanced in agriculture and knowledge
and have repeatedly signified to me their ardent
wish for a few good farmers to come amongst them
also some mechanicks, particularly a blacksmith
--As these Indians have frequent communications
with their brethren at Sanduskey I thought proper
to deliver your address to their Interpreter desiring him
to commit it to faithful Men to carry to
Sanduskey where there are persons (particularly Isaac
Williams a half blooded Wyandot who has an
excellent education) capable of reading and
explaining it to the chiefs there or if the Inter-
preter should himself see any of the Sandusky
chiefs, I desired him to explain it to them; and
told him to return the orriginal to me, with
an answer from the Sanduskey chiefs as soon as
possible, all which he promised to do. When I
receive an answer it will be communicated
to you without delay As Cash is excessively scarce in this country &
Credit cannot be obtained but for a few days
especially on Iron Work, I shall find it necessary to
advance the Cash, if I should order the utensils to
be made which are mentioned in your address.
Besides, the mode of remiting payments to this place
in cash per mail is subject to great delays and
risques. I would therefore suggest to you, the pro-
priety of either drawing yourselves on some
friend here who would be accommodated by a
payment in Baltimore, or apply to the Secretary
of the United States Treasury for a draft on the
collector of this district. You will know what sum
of money you can spare to devote to this object, &
if committed to me it shall be faithfully applied &
accounted for to you 
Friends! I approve greatly of your charitable 
intentions towards the Indians, and applaud your 
benevolent and disinterested exertions to civilize 
them. ALl to whom I have mentioned the 
contents and letter express great satisfaction in 
the same. It is particularly wished that the 
friends might obtain a footing and an influence 
amongst the Indians, as their precepts and exam- 
ples are powerfully, pointed against the 
characteristic and predominent Indian vices — 
idleness — intemperence — and war Of all Christian denominations you appear 
to understand the right method of accomplishing 
the object long wished for and sought by pious 
people towards the Indians and are going the right 
way to work, for it is an indubitable truth that 
they must be civilized by Agriculture &c. before they 
can be efficiently benefited in their religion 
or morals — I have a plan in my mind which 
I have long cherished, and am the more convinced 
in its eligibility since I have had an opportunity 
to become acquainted with the Indians in this 
Country — extending perhaps a little beyond what you 
may have contemplated, but substantially founded 
on the same principles, but which you appear to be 
governed in your efforts towards them, I will 
take the liberty to make it known to you soon requesting 
Your consideration of and Interest in its favour
should it meet with your approbation. I am also
collecting materials for a history of all this part
of the Country, particularly of the Indians, and 
of its natural productions &c. accept my best wishes for your success & prosperity
Stanley Griswold acting Governor
of Michigan Teritory Michigan Teritory 1 June 1806
Friends I committed your address (as was mentioned
in my former letter) to the interpreter and the
principal chief of the Wyandot at Moguago to
be communicated and explained to the chiefs
at Sanduskey- they have lately waited on me
with the following information- That they dispatched two young men
 with the address to Tarhie at Sanduskey who
were gone 7 days- that they found him with
other chiefs and many more people assembled at a 
funeral- that a missionary preacher was there
whose name they had forgot- that on making known
their errand and producing the address the preacher
interfered and strongly urged the chiefs and people
not to hearken to the Quakers nor accept any
thing from them, not even the implements of
Husbandry offered by you as a present- that if
they wanted such things he (the preacher) made no
doubt the missionary society in whose service he
was employed would furnish them with what they
wanted- and- that they could get no particular
answer from the chiefs at that time. But, it is
possible either you or I may hear from them
by and by Who this preacher is, I know not. But who
ever he may be, I am sure he ought never to
have been sent to the Indians, to act so much
like a heathen himself, so contrary to the Gospel
of peace, and to the interests of the poor nations &
of the U.S and of us all who reside near the
savages- The Missionary Society of Connecticut
have had preachers in that quarter, but whether
he belonged to that or an other society, is uncertain
I should hope better of my nation state, than that
they would employ such men for christian
teachers- I hope the clergy of New England are
not for Renewing the spirit of former times aga
inst the Quakers- too much cannot be done for
the improvement of the Indians, and if that, or
any other society, would share them assistance in
 the line offered by you, they certainly could do it
and still suffer the poor Indians to receive the
benefit of yours- the Natives in question are ripe
for exchanging the savage life for civilization, &
are very desirous to obtain ploughs, hoes & which you
offer- those in this vicinity are frequently
speaking to me to procure for them these things
from the U.S- From the concern taken by the
Secretary of War respecting your communication
profering your bounty to the Indians in such
useful articles, I conclude the Government wish
to encourage your exertions, which so perfectly
accord with their own- It might be well to
make some enquiry by publication or otherways
to find what society, employs the Teacher who
has acted the part above mentioned- This letter
is at your service for that purpose, and if I
should receive further information it will be
communicated by Your friend &well wisher

concerns present 20 Members and our friends Jessee
Kersey, Nathan Sharpless Edward Garrick &George
Massey from the Yearly Meeting of Phila.
The sub committee informed that Wm Kirk 
had returned and made the following report
(for the Substance of which see report to Yearly
Meeting page 141 and sequel) 
The following friends were appointed to examine
the Treasurers account and prepare a report to the
yearly Meeting now acting and produce it to the
next meeting of the committee to wit Geo. Ellicott 
Jonathan Jessop David Grave Asa Moore 
Wm Kirk &PE Thomas 
then adjourned to tomorrow
evening at the 7th Hour 10 mo 16 1806 The committee again met, when
the friends appointed produced the following report This report is tipped-in TO THE
YEARLY MEETING, 
NOW SITTING. We, the Committee on Indian Concerns, inform, that since our
last report we have, agreeably to the liberty given us, published 
narrative of our proceedings, which has been distributed amongst
Friends. We further inform, that a letter has been received from
the Indian agent at Fort-Wayne, dated the Fifth of the Tenth
month, 1805, in which he says, 
Agreeably to the directions of the Committee, I have employ-
ed a man to assist the Indians in cultivating the field on the Wa-
bash, which was cleared and cultivated by Philip Dennis last
year. The Indians, with this man’s assistance, have raised, it is
supposed, at least six-hundred bushels of good Corn from this
field, exclusive of what they have raised from the ground of their own
clearing. Many of the Eel River and Weas Indians have removed
and settled at that place, where they will be followed by the
younger branches of their tribes in the ensuing spring. He adds, Believing as I do, that the Society of Friends are
desirous of ameliorating the situation of their red brethren in this
country, I will take the liberty to observe, that the present is a
very favourable time to put in execution, their benevolent views,
and that much good may be done on the Wabash by sending one
or two suitable men to reside amongst the Indians, in order to
teach them how to raise stock and cultivate the earth: Witness
what Philip Dennis effected amongst them the last year. At a
Station where he had every thing to begin, there are now at
least four hundred Hogs and twenty Cows, and at no village in
this country, do the Indians live as comfortably as at that place.
If this spirit of industry is kept alive for a few years, it will cer-
tainly have a powerful influence upon the minds of the Indians, at
many of the neighboring villages. The Committee, after deliberate consideration, were united in senti-
ment, that it would be proper to procure one or two young men to re-
side among the Indians at Dennis’s Station. William Kirk and his bro-
ther Mahlon were accordingly engaged, who arrived at the station on
the 25th of the Fourth Month last. William has just returned, having
left his brother among the Indians, and has given us the following in-
formation: That they had planted twelve acres of Indian corn, 
on the land already cleared; after which they enclosed eight acres
more; in six of which they cultivated Potatoes, Hemp, Flax,
Tobacco and Timothy, together with a variety of Garden Vege-
tables; that their crop of Corn, was likely to produce, at least fif-
ty bushels per acre; and that they should have one hundred bush-
els of Potatoes, and many more Garden Vegetables than would be
sufficient for their own use, which would be distributed amongst
the Indians; they have also erected a stable, 16 by 18 feet, and
assisted the Indians in building three houses. He further informs,
that half a mile below the Station, is a village, where they found
fourteen families of the Eel River Indians, which has this summer,
been increased by several families and many more are expected
this fall; That these Indians have raised a good crop of Corn, and
have several Horses, Cows, and many Hogs. Another village of
twenty families, of the Miamis, is settled about a half mile above
the Station. These have also raised a good crop of Corn, and
have several Horses and Cattle, and at least on hundred Hogs.
At both of those villages their Corn was planted by white people,
employed by the Indian agent, who, with their consent, deducts the
expence out of their annuities. After the Corn was planted, they
cultivated themselves. Adjacent to the Station, several families of Weas Indians are
settled, who have cleared six acres of land. The family with
which Philip Dennis resided, being one of them. This six acres,
together with part of what Philip Dennis cleared, which was not
cultivated by William and Mahlon Kirk , they have themselves cul-
tivated in Corn, except one plowing given it by William Kirk.
From this ground William expects they will have from sixty to
seventy bushels per acre. The young Indian who worked with
Philip Dennis, has a good sock of Cattle, and about four hundred
hogs. William further observes, that he visited several of the Indian
villages in that country, the Indians, at most of which, were anxious
to engage in the cultivation of their lands, and very solicitous
that aid should be extended to them by Friends; but he uniform-
ly replied to them that Friends had it not in their power to aid
more settlements than the one at present under their care. He
also informs, that the progress made by the Indians in civilization
surpasses any thing that could have been expected in so short a
time. There are, nevertheless, many amongst them, who have no
disposition to labour. The Indian agent and all the other officers of government, have
been very kind, and have done all in their power to make their situa-
tion comfortable. The young Indian who distinguished himself by
 working with Philip Dennis , gave them twenty Bushels of Corn and
some Hogs in return for the benefits received from the Friends last year.
Some of almost all the tribes residing within sixty miles of the sta-
tion, have visited them; these, and all the other Indians in the neigh-
bourhood have been very friendly and well disposed. He further
says, that he delivered the address from the committee, directed
by him to the principal Chiefs of the Miamis and others; in an-
swer to which, a reply was received from the Little Turtle , on behalf
of his own tribe, from which the following is an extract. Brothers and Friends, The words which you spoke to me and my brother chiefs, who
accompanied me to Baltimore some years ago, are yet fresh in my
memory, and also in the memory of your red brethren in this
country; for hen I returned home I explained faithfully to them
all that you requested. Brothers,
All you have said to us at and since that period, has been com-
municated to your red brothers of this country, which has caused
them to believe that you are their friends, and wish to relieve them
as far as lays in your power. Brothers,
Two springs ago you made your appearance here amongst us, 
and said it pleased the Great Spirit that you should visit us;
which visit is gratefully acknowledged by your red brethren in this
country. Brothers,
You told us at that time you came to give us all the assistance
in your power, and requested us to point out a place where we
thought your services would be of most benefit to us; we request-
ed you to go to the place where our friend William Kirk , who is
now present, has resided this summer; this place we chose be-
cause it was the most public, and would afford passengers an op-
portunity of seeing what was done more than any other we could
point out. You then raised a great crop of Corn and gave it to
your red brethren; the receipt of which was thankfully acknow-
ledged by them. Brothers,
You have now again made your appearance amongst your red
brethren in this country; they have listened to your words with
attention, and find they correspond with the first words you spoke
to us. You told us you came to occupy the same ground that you
had occupied two years ago, but did not request us to point out
to you at what place your services would be most beneficial, as
you did when you first arrived amongst us, which has prevented
your red brethren, residing elsewhere, from participating in your services Brothers, 
We believe your intentions towards your red brethren
are good, for which we are thankful to you; we hope that
the Great Spirit will continue it in your hearts, to relieve
your red brethren, who are at this time much in want of your
aid. Brothers,
We received with pleasure the implements of husbandry
 you sent us; we have endeavoured to use them but we have not
 been able to make right use of them, for want of some person
to teach us how they are used. Brothers,
You are come amongst us as it were this morning, the sun has
not yet risen to 12 o’clock; you have not stayed all night with us.
The families you have visited amongst us, are well pleased with
you, and confidently receive you as their brothers: we therefore,
hope you will continue amongst us, as we believe our attachment
will increase with the time you are with us. The committee have lately received another letter from
the Indian agent, in which he says that the Indians
at Dennis’s Station, as well as those at the Little Turtle’s Town,
eighteen miles north of Dennis’s Station, are advancing towards
civilization, exceeding all that could have been expected. We have examined the treasurer’s accompts, and find in his hands
219 dollars and 41 cents.
The committee, in concluding their report, are free to observe,
that upon a review of the progress made towards the accomplish-
ment of the object of their appointment, there appears to be great
cause of encouragement for Friends to persevere in this truly lauda-
ble and interesting concern, which has prospered, beyond the expec-
tations of Friends, at the time they first engaged in the undertak-
ing: and clearly demonstrates to the discerning mind, that it
hath indeed been divinely owned; and no discouragement or ob-
straction now appearing, but the want of funds, the committee
affectionately address themselves to the feelings of Friends. They
deem it not improper to remind them that the soil, from which,
through the mercy and goodness of Divine Providence, we derive
so many comforts and blessings, was once the inheritance of this
people. A small part of the abundance with which we are blessed
would, if rightly applied at the present time, be the means of ad-
ministering great comfort and advantage to them; and it is all-
important, that the present favourable crisis should be improved:
for if an opinion were to obtain amongst them, that Friends are
withdrawing their aid, they may become discouraged, and return
to their former mode of living for support, and thereby again
become plunged into that poverty and wretchedness, from which,
by the aid of the Friends, they are just emerging. The committee,
therefore fell themselves warranted in saying, that they believe, the
very existence of nations may depend upon the part we now act in
this business; they also consider, that the reputation of society is
deeply interested in the active prosecution of the concern; and
feel an earnest desire, that if the meeting should see it right to
continue them, Friends may be stimulated to more liberality, as it
is altogether impracticable for the committee to continue their ex-
ertions without the aid of additional funds. Signed on behalf of the Committee,

of removing his brother Mahlon Kirk to one of
the stations placed under his care by the Govern
ment; The sub committee informed that they
had written to those of our members residing at
Redstone, giving this information to them; And
had requested their assistance in procuring
suitable persons to succeed William &Mahlon
at Dennis Station, but no reply or information
was yet recd. from them. The committee having taken the subject
into consideration concluded it would be
best, under the present state of things to con
tinue our exertions to procure a well quali
fied person to take charge of our settlement
on the Wabash but if no such can be attained
the sub committee were directed to write to Wm.
Wells and desire him to employ a man to assist
the Indians on behalf of Friends in puting in
their crop the ensueing season and inform them that the President
of the United States, having employed the persons
which we had sent out to aid them, and no one
having offered to succeed them we had adopted this
measure as the best at the present time in
our power to be useful to them, and at the
same time assure the Indians of the continu
ance of our friendship and regard The sub committee were also directed to
write to our Members over the mountains &
inform them that it was the opinion of Friends
here it would not be proper to employ a
woman the next season at our station on
the Wabash, and that as no suitable individual
was likely to offer here we requested them
to continue their exertions to obtain if possible
one on that side of the mountains the sub
committee were also directed to inform Wm Kirk 
that we considered Mahlon as released from
our service Under a solid consideration of the very
important change committed to William Kirk &
the great responsibility attached to the right dis
charge of the trust confided to him the committee
concluded to appoint the following friends to

as directed addressed a letter to friends at Redstone
of which the following is a copy Balto. 2 mo10 1807
Dear Friends The Government of the United
States having taken Wm &Mahlon Kirk into its
employ and our settlement on the Wabash being
in consequence thereof likely to become vacant
we some time past requested your aid in procuring
if possible a suitable man and his wife to take charge
of this attention- Since which time a general Meet
ing of the committee has been held and if appeared
 to be the prevailing sentiment, that it would be
premature to send a woman there at this time,
we therefore request if you should not already have
contracted with one that you would decline the
prospect of engaging any other than one man
for the next season It appearing to the committee to be very
important that an individual should be engaged
so as to take charge of it by the time, or soon
after Mahlon withdraws, we earnestly solicit your
active attention to the subject, and hope you will
without delay communicate to us, your prospect of
succeeding, as we shall if you are not likely to obtain
one on the other side of the mountains exert our
selves here, it would however be very desirable 
that you could succeed there on account of the
saving of expence in traveling out It will no doubt occur to you that a person
a little advanced in life would be prefered by the
committee if such a one could be found and
as an encouragment to those who may fell drawn
to engage in this service, we may inform that Wm
Kirk proposes to make our station his principal resi
dence Should there not appear any prospect of a
suitable person offering in the neighbourhood of
Red Stone, we suggest the propriety of you forwarding
this letter to the Miami settlement, perhas Jona
than Wright or some other friend might be
induced to engage for a few months- You probably
are informed that we have two Horses and the
necessary farming utensils at the station We are affectionately your frds

addressed the following letter to Wm Kirk Baltimore 2 mo10 1807
Respected friend Wm Kirk The committee on Indian
concerns had a Meeting last evening which was
generally attended and have concluded that as thee
is now in the employ of Government, thy brother
Mahlon may be serviceable to thee in thy new
situation in that Country, they have therefore
concluded to leave thee at liberty to take him
in thy employ on thy arrival there The committee some time since requested
those of their members residing over the moun
tains to procure a suitable man & his wife to
reside at Dennis’ Station since when they have
received no reply, but they have now concluded
that it would be premature to send a woman
at this time, and have requested them to procure
a man only, if they should not succeed, nor we be
able to succeed here, we shall then endeavour to
get Wm Wells to procure some person or persons to
manage the business in the same manner it was
done before thee went into that country but if
they should succeed in obtaining a person to reside
at Dennis Station we hope thee will render any
service or advice that may be convenient Thee will please to forward Mahlons account as
soon as possible after thy arrival, and as we have
paid a draft drawn by Wm Wells respecting which 
we are without any advice from Mahlon, thee
will please to give un information on that subject
also If thee can find use for the two Horses at
the Station thee may take them and the farming
utensils belonging to the committee under thy
charge, until further advised or until some 
other person arrives to take them, but if that
is not convenient, please to deliver them to 
 Wm Wells The committee would be glad to hear
what distribution was made of the last years
crop- How many Hogs there are belonging to
Friends, and the general state of things at the
settlement when Mahlon withdraws from it We are Thy frds
 Evan Thomas Elisha Tyson Geo. Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins P.E. Thomas The committee appointed to prepare and forward
an address to William Kirk , informed that they
had complied with the service and forwarded the 
following communication to him Balto. 3 mo 4 1807
 Wm Kirk 
 Dear friend The committee of
Baltimore Yearly Meeting on Indian concerns
being informed that the Government has em
ployed thee to superintend a plan which it
has adopted to promote the civilization of
the Miami confederacy of Indians and
others, feel their minds impressed with an
anxious solicitude for thy preservation in
the new and exposed situation which thou
will be placed. And under the influence of
an ardent desire that the very important
trusts confided to thee, may through divine
aid be so conducted, as to promote the
laudable views of our Government, & secure
the Benefits intended to this heretofore much
neglected people, the committee feel themselves
in brotherly affection drawn to extend such
admonition and caution as they may be ena
bled to give thee- on the prudent management of the
charge now committed to thee, circumstances
of very great importance to our Country will
rest, perhaps indeed the existence of whole
nations of those people who are to become
the objects of thy care, may depend upon the
effect produced, by the present liberal and
christian effort to civilize them;- for should
this attempt not succeed, the failure may be
discouraging not only to the Government but
to the Indians themselves, and they turn their
attention altogether from the cultivation
of their lands- Should this be the case, &
the Indians continue in their present wandering
habits, and disposition of mind, it must inevitably
lead, to the entire annihilation of their race
in a few centuries: Whilst on the other hand
the committee entertain no doubt, but a judi
cious administration of the powers with
which thou art entrusted, would in a little
time draw their attention from their present
mode of living, and fix them in habits,
which would not only secure to them all
the necessary comforts, but be the means of
perpetuating their existence as a people, and
securing their attachment to the Govern
ment of the United States. Under this
consideration of the subject, the committee
have been led to view thy situation as a
highly responsible and important one,
the great confidence reposed in thee has
certainly a strong claim upon thy utmost
zeal, and the committee earnestly hope, that
the philanthropic views of the government
will not be frustrated, by any want of an
active, faithful and concientious discharge
of thy duty At this distance from the scene
of thy labours, it cannot be expected that
the committee should enter into a minute
detail of the course it would be proper for
thee to pursue, but there are certain general
principles which obviously & indispensably
should pervade all the operations: In the
first place and above all things, the com
mittee affectionately exhort thee to a frequent
and humble recurence, to that divine and
preserving power which the great Lord and
Master has declared is sufficient for us, and under the
influence of which, if we steadily &faithfully
abide, we may safely travel along through
every difficulty and every trial The Government manifests a 
disinterested, liberal and benevolent policy
toward the Indians, and the committee
strongly desire that the same disinterestedness 
may be manifested by thee and that thou
mayest in all thy movements be preserved
from any views of pecuniary emolument 
beyond the liberal salary allowed thee, being
influenced in thy conduct,
solely by a desire to promote their
comfort and welfare- To relieve the wants
and be instrumental in promoting the comfort of
so many thousands of our fellow creatures
must of itself administer sufficient reward
to a feeling mind. Thou art not uninformed
that much injury and great injustice have been
done these people, the present government of
the United States, shows every disposition to
conduct itself with Humanity and justice
towards them, and we do believe is disposed, to
do every thing in its power to discharge the
obligations due from our country to them-
Thy duty will be faithfully to carry into exe
cution its views The work unavoidably must be
gradual in its progress early
prejudices and fixed habits are not easily era
dicated, every nation being strongly attached
to the manners and customs of its ancestors
we therefore find that great national changes
have always been effected slowly, and thou
must not expect, that the Indians will gene
rally fall in with thy views until they become
fully convinced, that the change proposed
will promote their advantage; the committee
therefore advise thee not to undertake too
much at first, but commence thy operations
on a small scale; thou will recollect, that
thy business is not to raise food for the Indi
ans, without being assisted by them, this would
only be to encourage them in idleness, but
the object of thy appointment, is, to teach
them how to provide the necessary comforts
for themselves, which can never be done, but
by their consenting to aid in the cultivation
of their lands, and gradually becoming accus
tomed to labour they will feel the benefits
of it, and in time be altogether drawn
off from a precarious dependence upon
fishing & hunting for a support It will be most prudent for thee, not
to urge the Indians too much to receive thy
aid, but rather wait to be solicited by them;
in all thy communications with them, thou
shouldest endeavour to impress them with
a just idea, of the friendly disposition of the 
president of the United States and Secretary
of War towards them, and it is important that
they should be fully satisfied, the Government in
its present undertaking is actuated solely by a
desire to benefit them, for we apprehend that
the Traders residing amongst them being interested
in keeping them in their present uncivilized
state will use great efforts to counteract thy
exertions, and will throw every obstacle they
can in the way of any plan that may be adopted
for their civilization, they will also probably
endeavour to persuade the Indians, that the
Government is now influenced by some
interested motive, and if they can no other
way succeed in rendering the present attempt
abortive, will even endeavour to induce
them to abandon their present settlements
and remove further to the westward. And
as these traders by living amongst the
Indians and speaking their language, have
a great influence over them, it will
require much circumspectiom and wisdom in thee to
counteract this influence. Thou must be
cautious in thy communications to them
and very particular in the selection of interpret
ters- We apprehend it will rarely be safe
for thee to make use of a trader for this purpose. In thy communications with
the Secretary of War thou shouldest at all
times exhibit a candid and unreserved
view of the state of business under the care
in as clear and concise a manner as
thou art capable of and in the disburse
ment of the public money observe the strictest
regard to economy and the interests of the
government, keeping thy expenditures by
all means within the amount allowed thee Every effort should also be used to se
cure the attachment of the Indians and 
every alurement held out to induce them
to labour, this will best be effected, by
an examplary, prudent &correct deportment
amongst them Much will also depend 
upon thy selecting suitable persons, to reside
at the intended settlements they should
be men, who would be good examples of
industry and of steady habits, who engage
in the service from principle and not
altogether from pecuniary motives- The
committee consider the plan on which
thou art to act as well calculated to
effect the object desired, and from an
honest discharge of the trust confided to
thee they confidently expect a result, highly
beneficial to the Indians and gratifying
to the friends of humanity As a member for the society of friends, whose
appointment to this very important charge
perhaps has its origin in that confidence
which our committee lately placed in
thee, by giving thee the superior tendency
of our station on the Wabash, we feel a
strong solicitude, that all thy movements
in the prosecution of the duties of thy
appointment, may be marked with a
corectness and integrity, correspondent
with thy religious professions. That thy
general conduct may evince a regard
to the solemn obligations of uprightness,
intitle thee to the gratitude of the Indians
and the approbation of the government
and finally produce in thy own mind the 
enjoyment of that peace , which arrises
from an honest discharge of duty, is the
very affectionate desire of our committee
on Indian concerns Addressed by the direction & &Signed on behalf of the committee

Report, that since the last Yearly Meeting
we have been engaged in endeavouring to
promote the concern of Friends for effecting
the civilization of the Indian Natives, &
the introduction of the arts of Husbandry
amongst them, and although nothing very 
important has occurred in our intercourse
with them, since our last report yet we 
believe they are gradually becoming more &
more desirous to avail themselves of the aid 
which is proffered them by Friends our settlement on the Wabash remained
under the care of one of the young men who 
were employed by us for the last year, until 
early in the 5th month last. It appears by 
information from him, that his time was
occupied during the winter in taking care
of the Stock, clearing more ground, and
geting rails to enclose it. He also informed that
the corn &Garden Vegetables which were raised
& not wanted for his own use, had been distributed
amongst such of the Indian families as were in
necessitous circumstances The Government of the United States
has evidenced a friendly &liberal disposition
towards the Indians bordering on our frontier
and appeared on all occasions, anxiously
disposed to promote as far as its influence
& ability extended the work of civilization
amongst them. By its assistance some tribes
of the Southern Indians have advanced very
considerably towards civilization & having
with a view to extend the same benefits
to the western Tribes recently adopted a
plan which is extensively calculated

Vegetables- They also inform that they have
assisted many of the Indians in rendering
their houses more comfortable & plowed &
assisted in planting one field of Corn

that they had commenced clearing land
& built a House for their own accommodation

for sufferings of Phila. $8000 as a part of our
proportion of money raised by our brethren
of Great Britain and remited to them, to be
divided amongst friends in America in
aid of the concern for promoting the
civilization of the Indians, and they suggest to
the Yearly Meeting the propriety of investing
the donation of our brethren in England
in some productive Stock & of limiting
their expenditures of it to its annual proceeds It appears by information which has
reached us that many of the Indians inha
biting the country bordering on our Station
have latterly become extremely unsetled &
disquieted in their minds respecting some
religious controversies, which have been
excited amongst them by one Indian
styling himself as a Prophet and that in con
sequence thereof great numbers have
collected together & intirely neglected any
kind of attention to agriculture or other
concerns we have not understood that
those residing at our station or 
immediately in its neighbourhood have yet
had any concern or taken any part in these
controversies, but should this hereafter un
happily be the case, the committee are 
 apprehensive it may for a short time
probably interrupt that progress towards
civilization which has heretofore been so
conspicuous amongst them The committee are aware that in
the prosecution of this concern difficul
ties and discouragements will most
likely often occur- It is a great &
important work which cannot be
effected but with time, yet they feel strength
end in the belief that as friends endeavour
to abide patiently under the weight of the
concern it will continue to progress &
they humbly trust be finally crowned with
success We have examined the Treasurers

Respected friend By the time thou receivest
this letter, we hope thou will be in readiness to set
out for our station on the Wabash, and that
thou hast procured a suitable person to go with thee.
After getting there we wish thee to commence, thy
operations, by, Tending a field of Corn And othe ar
ticles And in assisting and advising, The Indians
in the Vicinity of the Station, As thou didst the last
year, We wish thee to use thy influence with the In
dians not only to work themselves But to let their
horses also. We have written a letter to the white Loon , The
chief of the Village, and others Which we request thou
wouldst give them and we wish thee to be careful to
to have it ready and interpreted to them It is probable some of our number may pay you
a visit this season to be with you about the middle
of the fifth month. We wish thee to write to us from
time to time through the course of the season giving
information of the progress. And be careful to forward
a particular Account. To be here by the yearly meeting Signed on behalf of the Committee
P.E. Thomas Clk To the white Loon and our other Red Brothers
residing at Dennis Station on the Wabash. Our friend John Shaw has returned to spend
another season in your Country Argreeably to the request
made by our Red Brothers Through William Welles ;
We felt such a desire for you improvement that we 
prevailed on him to spend another season with you Brothers he comes with no other view but to be of
benefit to our Red Brothers. With no other view
but to encourage you to turn your attention to the
cultivation of your lands in order that you may
be enabled to procure a comfortable support for
yourselves your Women and your Children and
which you find greatly to be prefered to the
precarious subsistence which you have heretofore
received from hunting and fishing. Brothers our friend has come a long way
to be helpful to you. We hope you will attend to his
advise And will be willing to be instructed by him If you will attend to his advises, and will turn
your attention to raising stock, and to the cultivation
of your lands, you may in a short time have plenty
for yourselves your Women and Children and become
a happy people. Brothers we hope your young men will be wil
ling to work themselves. And will also be willing
to let your horses work, for we believe the good
Spirit gave us horses to help cultivate our lands Brothers we believe the good Spirit placed us here
on Earth to do good, And to be of service to each other,
And it is on this ground alone, we are made willing
to contribute a part of what we have procured by in
dustry, in order to convince our Red Brothers that
they, their Women, And Children would receive a
great benefit, And would be much more happy if they
would fall into our mode of living. Brothers. Some of you have now made a beginning
and we hope see the advantage resulting from cultiva
ting your lands, We wish you to persevere. Brothers remember as we have before said
we want nothing from you for our services. We dont
want any of your lands.
Brothers there is one thing more which we
cannot omit mentioning to you, It is respecting
spiritous liquors. We intreat it of you not to
suffer any of that pernicious article to be brought
into your Towns. For we conceive it to be one of the 
greatest evils that ever was introduced into the World Brothers many of the Red people as well as
the white, have lost their lives by making use of it
It will destroy your health it will destroy your senses
And it will disqualify you doing all good acts For these reasons Brothers we hope you will
discontinue the use of it Brothers we expect some of our friends will
be at your Villages this summer for the purpose of
seeing your situation, And giving you good advice,
If you should see them, we hope you will make them
as comfortable as you can signed on behalf of the committee
 Baltimore 3 mo 20th 1808
 Evan Thomas Thomas Moore Geo. Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins Philip Dennis Elias Ellicott Jesse Hughes Caleb Bently To the Miamy Puttowattomy &amp; other nations of Indians
near fort Wayne Brother We have prevailed on our Brothers Elisha
Tyson & James Gillingham & D. Graves to make you a visit
and take you by the hands on our behalf. they will 
have a long distance to travel but we hope they will be
able to give you such advice as will if attended to be of
great service to you and that you will make their 
situation whilst in your country as comfortable as you
can they are our brothers in whom we can confide and we
request that you will receive whatever they may have to say
as coming immediately from us Brothers We have desired them to visit as many of you
as they can, in order to council with you & Should they
not be able to stay in your Country until the meeting
of your general council we have instructed them to
leave this address & get your Brother Wm Wells or some
other person to communicate it to you Brother You will remember that about 6 years
ago the Little Turtle Five Medals & some other chiefs of
your nation visited our country at which time they
and your brothers the quakers of Baltimore had an
opportunity of taking each other by the hands. Brethren These Chiefs having in the course of their
journey seen how much more comfortably the white
people lived than their Red Brethren, were led to
inquire by what means they might on their return to their
own Country be enabled to procure for their people the
same comforts which they saw in the families here Brethren Your brothers the quakers of Baltimore in
a talk which they then had with them explained to them
the means by which we obtained these things- we told
them that it all came out of the grounds and that it
was by cultivating our lands that we were enabled to got
them Brothers These chiefs then told us that it was their
wish to obtain for their Women & children the same comforts
and that they would on their return home turn their
attention to the cultivation of their lands and for the
purpose of aiding you we procured and forwarded
to fort wayne the next summer to the care of Wm Welles 
for your use some ploughs Harness for horses axes Hoes & Brothers You afterwards informed us that you had rcd
these implements of Husbandry, and that it was your wish 
to make use of them but that you did not know
how to begin in the cultivation of your lands, and
invited us to send some of our friends into your country
to see your situation, and to give you such instruction
as might be necessary Brethren In consequence of this request and the
friendship which we had for our Red Brethren we did
in the succeeding summer prevail on some of our friends to make
you a visit and one of them remained with you during
the season, to teach you the use of the tools we take hold 
of and put you in a way to provide for yourselves your 
women &Children, the many necessaries they were in need of Brethren It is now several years since we first took
each other by the hands- we have during all this time
been endeavouring to draw your attention to the cultiva
tion of your lands, and have several summons sent
some of our friends to stay with you to give you the
necessary instruction Brethren when our friends first went into your
country they requested such of your Cheifs as were
present to point out the most suitable place to begin
the improvement these chiefs said it had better be at
neither of their villages and after consulting together fixed
on the Wabash and pointed out a particular spot, which
they wished us to to commence the reasons which they gave
for that being the most proper place was that the river
 was navigable and a public road passed by this place
on the bank of it, it was of course the most public spot
they could point out which had equal advantages of
soil and would afford many of your your young men
as they passed by an opportunity of learning from the
example set them, and accordingly the settlement was
commenced and has been continued at that place
ever since: it has been our intention after our Red
brethren who have removed to reside at Dennis station
shall have become so advanced as to be able to proceed
without the aid of further instruction from us to
propose to your chiefs to take into consideration if they
wish us to extend assistance to any other place & if they
should conclude to request it leave them at liberty
to propose such other spot as they may prefer. Brethren As we have already told you so we again
repeat it, it is only by the cultivation of your lands
and rearing of stock that you can ever raise your
selves from the situation which you have here
tofore been in. the white people find it necessary
to do so in order to get food and cloathing for 
themselves. Brethren There are some amongst us who are
not industrious and will not work these cannot
earn the comforts for themselves which industrious
people do but are often in great distress and poverty
so that we clearly see it is by industry that a
comfortable living must be obtained. Brethren We believe it right to employ our horses
and oxen in tilling our lands, they are strong and
one of them can do more work in a day than
many men. We believe that the good spirit gave
them to us in order to help us in this way. you ought
therefore if you wish to adopt our mode of living use
your horses & oxen in ploughing and other work which
they can do Brethren listen we have never felt any sentiment
but friendship for of course are not afraid to speak
to you as brethren who love each other ought to do.
Therefore we now tell you that we believe Whiskey
to be one of the greatest evils which the Bad Spirit
has introduced into the world it brings more misery
& poverty along with it than any other thing that has
ever been found in this Country Brethren We intreat you not to suffer any of this
Poison to be brought to your towns you have seen the
effect of it and must know its destructive consequences
Whiskey not only corrupts the minds of those that
drink it but also occasions great poverty & distress in
the families of those men who get drunk because it
destroys their reason and disqualifies them for work 
It has this effect upon the white people who drink
it and will have the same effect upon you Brethren we believe that the good Spirit
placed all men on this earth as brothers and that
it is their duty to do all the good they can to each
other it is altogether on the ground that we are made
willing to contribute a part of what we have obtained
by our industry in order to assist our Red Brothers
it is this that has made us anxious to convince you
that you would be much happier if you would lay
aside your present mode of living and adopt the
more certain and less laborious mode of living by
the cultivation of the earth Brethren we always told you that in sending
our young men into your country to show you how
to use the tools which your chiefs saw in the Lands
of the white people we did not seek our advantage
we now again give you this assurance and hope
you will be convinced that in doing it never had
any object in view but your own good Brethren It is our desire that you will keep
this paper which we now send you as a document
in your hands that we have no claim on you or
your children who may come after you for our
services and will never ask any lands or other
rewards from you or them
 avoid all kinds of Whiskey- By this you will in a few
years find yourselves surrounded by the same
plenty that you saw in the families of the white
people Then adjourned At a Meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns 8 mo 8 1808 present 14 members The friends appointed to visit the Indians
at and in the neighbourhood of our settlement
on the Wabash reported that they left Baltimore
the 4 of the 4 Month, 1808 & arrived at Fort Wayne
the 10th of the 5th Month on their route they
passed by the residence of David Grave of
Westland &Benjamin Idings residing on the
West Branch of the Great Miami who both
accompanied them whilst the remained amongst
the Indians. Having on their arrival concluded
it would be best to have a general conference
with the Indians at that place, they were
invited to attend in council 10 days from 
that time, in the mean time the committee
made a visit to the Indians residing at
Dennis Station at which place the Indians
manifested a friendly disposition towards
them. They have found that some of the Indians
had made considerable progress in the cultivation
of their lands by the aid of White Men hired
out of their annuities, and a few of them
by their own labour. But the insatiable desire
these people have for spirituous liquors, and the
quantity they obtain from the state of Ohio
renders it a matter of doubt in the opinion
of the Committee whether much progress
will be made in civilization whilst it remains 
in their power to possess themselves of that
destructive article. The young men in the
employ of friends at that place were
engaged in preparing for a crop of corn &c.
and appeared to be acting prudently, the
Indians as well as whites in the neighbout
hood expressed satisfaction with their conduct
since their residence amongst them The committee whilst at Dennis Station
convened the Indians of that place & read the
address to them which was intended to have been taken
out by John Shaw , but which did not reach
redStone in time to come into his hands before
he left that place, they also made such
other observations to them as they thought ne
cessary. The white Loon a principal chief 
of the peace acknowledged the propriety of 
what was said but declined giving a full answer
until after the general council which would
soon be held at Fort Wayne, where a particu
lar reply would be made- after which the
committee returned to Fort Wayne & on the 25th of
the 5th month which was the day previously
fixed on to hold a council they met a depu
tation of the Miamie & Puttowattomy nations
of Indians when the following communications
took place between them The address of the committee of the Yearly 
meeting of Baltimore dated 19th of the third month 1808
 was read & interpreted. The committee then proceeded
to read speeches delivered at different conferences
held at Baltimore on the 26th & 27th of the 12th mo
1801 between the society of friends & the little
turtle Five medals Tuthinipee &c. &c. which were
also interpreted first in Miami & afterwards in
Potowatomic by the interpreter at the US. They were then reminded that the
speech on spirituous liquors delivered at Balto. by the
little Turtle which had just been read pointed out
the evil effect of spirituous liquors on the Indians
and its destruction was likewise at this time noti
ced. At length, the following written communi
cation from Elisha Tyson James Gillingham 
David Grave & Benjamin Iddings was then
delivered to them- Brothers of the Miami & Potowatomic Nations we have come at the request of our Brothers the Quakers
of Baltimore to see you & take you by the hand
and have read their talk to you & we are glad
to see you here at this time- Our two Brothers David Grave & Benjn Iddings 
who are now present felt so much love for you that
they were willing to accompany us into you Country
to see how you did & how you were learning to till
the grounds & raise grain & cattle for food for
yourselves your wives & your children. Brothers, we thank the great spirit for bring
ing us safe to you. we have been at Dennis’s
station on the Wabash & were glad to see that
some of our red Brethren are likely to do well there
and hope that they & all the rest of our red Brothers 
will get their eyes open so that they may see and
their hearts made good, that they may be willing
to do the things that are best for them. Brothers we decided to visit several of your towns
but there fell so much rain that the waters
were made high & the roads so bad we thought
we could not come- Brothers we were very sorry to hear that some
of our red brothers still drink too much Whisky
we wish to persuade you to look at it and see
how much harm it does you, you may be sure
that the man who lets you have it is not your
friend, but your enemy who will cheat you who
will destroy you. In order Brothers to convince you that what
we say is true we will read to you part of a 
talk of one of your Chiefs spoke to the Quakers in
Baltimore a few years ago: the speech was then read. Brothers we wish you to remember that you
have requested us to show you how to work, we
have sent men for that purpose not merely to work
for you, but to show you how to work for yourselves
If you intend still to endeavour to learn & wish
them to continue to instruct you we want you to
tell us so. If you say you do not desire it we will
take our young men away- This was all they had to say to the Indians until
they received their answer Elisha Tyson rose &
observed that you have heard what your Chiefs
have said some years ago that they had applied
to their father the President of the United States 
for assistance. Your father is rich and is able and
willing to assist you. You have plainly seen he
is willing to assist you he has sent you tools and
his young men into your Country to work for you
& instruct you how to use them. that they came
into your very towns for this purpose. All this was
done at the request of your Chiefs When these young
men came forward you refused to receive them, how
can you expect after this the assistance of your father
let your wants be ever so great. we now want to
know the reason why you have refused to receive
the young men (sent by your father the President)
when come to your doors to assist you The council adjourned until the evening when
it opened again and the Five medals spoke in
reply as follows Brothers we have heard all you have said
and we thank the great spirit for putting it in
our power to meet this day. we the Miamis and
Potowatomies make one and are satisfied with
what you have said. You see how many of us
are here with you. Our principal Chiefs are not
here now The Little Turtle nor the Massasiniway 
Indians are not here. You have asked us questions
which we will endeavor to answer- You have told
us you had a pity on and this has been the uniform
language to us from you since we first knew you
In consequence of what we have said we saw 
the aid of our father last spring at this place
you will now hear the reason why we did
not receive it. I suppose that the man that
was sent here last spring, was sent here for the
purpose of aiding us but as it often happens
that we are all engaged in some business that
we consider of more importance than other business
which was the case when the aid of our father
arrived among us, we had no wish to refuse
the aid of our father- The same cause that
existed last year when our father offered his aid
still exists in consequence of which you do not
now see our chiefs present- We wish you to lay
that aside we have not rejected the aid of our
father and we hope that will be no cause for you
to withdraw your aid from us, you often told us
you loved us & we hope you will continue your aid
towards us & when you see our great father we hope
you will tell him this- Those people that requested
William Kirk to withdraw for a time, are not present
& we are sorry for it. I must observe to you that
this is what was said to Wm Kirk by the Indians
that met him at this place last spring- he was
asked if he had an address from their father
they did not see his name to any paper, they then
believed that their father had been liberal
towards them that he had appropriated money 
for their use but they had never seen it. I only
give you this information we have given our
father the reason of our rejecting him & we ought
not to be questioned for our reasons at this place-
This is all we shall have to say to you at pres-
ent you see our Chiefs are not present when
they & us have assembled we will communi
cate all you have said to us & they will give
such an answer as they think most proper- The white Loon of Dennis’s Station then
spoke as follows It is with great pleasure that I see that
the hearts of our brothers are disposed to do
us service- I am sorry that the Cheifs are not
present to give such an answer as the question
requires. It is natural for you to expect me to 
say something. I will speak of those young men
you have sent from time to time to assist us
at our villages. To meet your views & to give you
a proof that we wish to better our situation
we have taken several annuities and applied
them to the improvement of our farms we have
employed men to build houses &fences &open our
farms upon which we are at work you sent two
men amongst us & told us they were to aid &
assist us it has now been two years since you sent
men amongst us it is seldom or never we see them 
working inside of our fences from this you
must not understand me that I am displea
sed with the aid we have received we are
entirely satisfied with it It is two years since
you sent these people amongst us. I repeat
they have not been so useful to us as I expected
yet I am not dissatisfied- They generally
work a field by themselves beyond our house
we are glad of the aid you have offered us, But 
would be better pleased if you would extend
your aid more generally amongst us
My Brothers would then have reason to be
glad as well as myself. You have told us
that these people you have sent amongst us
would aid & assist us. This is an evidence of the
good you wish to do for us & it is a misfortune
among your red Brethren that they are not all
of one sentiment on this subject. we are very glad
of the aid that you have sent us, we would rather
the young men you send us would aid us in our
own fields they would be of more service to us
in this way. It also has been said amongst us
when our Brethren wish to withdraw from us
altogether, who is to take possession of their
improvements they are not sufficient for us all 
last year the young men you sent raised a fine
crop of corn. We were glad when we were going
home to hear them say it should be divided
among us, this was very pleasing to us I
thanked you in my heart for the aid you
had intended to our people. some days after
this we were informed that our Brothers inten
ded to gather the corn and put it up in a crib, we
then understood that the corn would be put up
& reserved for us until spring when it would be
of more use, That our brothers would return
and divide it among us this When John Shaw 
arrived he told us that when our people were
in need of corn to come down & get it. I told
J Shaw that the Indians considered the corn as
given to them last fall & that they would not
be so well satisfied as if the Indians were
assembled & it was given to them all at once
I then told him not to divide it in the way
he proposed but to let it remain until the arrival
of Wm Wells . Shaw observed that what I said was
true but that he thought a number might suffer
for want of it during the absence of Wm Wells & that
the said Wm Wells had requested him to lend him
some of the corn, When Friends & Wm Wells came & went 
away again. I was to that the corn was all gone
when my people went down to receive the corn
they found it had almost all been removed
I then told the people not to receive it as there
would not be enough for them all- I am high
ly pleased to see you in this Country. You ex
pected to find your young men working in
our fields, instead of which you found them
working in a field by themselves, we would
like it much better if they would work in
our fields- The Chiefs not being present I
do not find myself authorised to say any
thing further on the subject- Elisha Tyson then observed that they appeared
desirous of receiving further assistance, & that
 to extend more than one place. We told
your Chiefs when in Baltimore that we could
not assist them at more than one place at a 
time, that we were poor but their father the
President was rich & able to help them, and
we had learned that he had promised them
his aid & we cannot understand why the young
men with their tools which their father had
sent were turned back when the expense was
nothing to the Indians yet it cost your father 
the President much money. When your gen
eral council meets we shall expect an answer
to all we have said & particularly to the
address of the committee herewith handed &
deposited with Wm Wells . Our young men on the
Wabash must have time to raise corn for them
selves & their horses. Whilst at work they have
had a house to raise & other work to do & have
not had time hitherto to raise more than was
sufficient for their own use & that the surplus
shall always be given to the Indians & not
sold. The object of our young men in coming to
your country was to learn you to work & not to
raise corn for themselves. The young men have
put away as much of the corn only as was suf
ficient for their own support, the balance will
be delivered to the Indians at any time they
want it. When your Chiefs were at Baltimore
they informed us that they walked in the thorny
path and wished to walk after us, We want them
to do as we do, to accustom their children to work
when young & this is the way to walk in the path 
which we have walked in
after which the council adjourned It appearing to be he united judgment
of the committee that but little permanent
advantage will likely to result to the 
Indians from the aid furnished them by
Friends whilst they have access to spirituous
liquors, with which destructive article they
frequently supply themselves by going into
the state of Ohio and a prospect being
opened that by an application on the part
of Friends to the legislature of Ohio a law
might be obtained which would prevent
their procuring it within the jurisdiction
of that state. The subject after solid de
liberation was refered to the further conside
ration of next meeting The sub committee were directed
to address such communications to
John Shaw & Isaac Griffith . John Johnson &
the Indians as circumstances may render expedient
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian concerns
present 25 Members and several of our brethren from
the Yearly Meeting of Pennsylvania A letter from John Shaw dated the 4th
of last month giving an acct. of the disposition
of the Indians and present state of our settlement
at the Wabash was recd. The prospect of addressing the legislature of
Ohio on the subject of the introduction of spirituous
liquors amongst the Indians was refered for further 
consideration. George Ellicott , Even Thomas , James Gillingham , Asa
Moore, Gerard T Hopkins & P E Thomas & David Grave 
were appointed to prepare a report to the yearly
Meeting & produce it to the next meeting of the
committee, they were also desired to examine
the Treasurer acct & report the state of our funds Then adjourned to meet on the evening of the 12th
Inst. at the 7th hour- at which time the committee again
met present 18 Members The proposal of addressing the Legislature
of Ohio on the subject of the introduction
of Spirituous liquors amongst the Indians from
that state being again weightily considered, it
was concluded best to decline the prospect at
this time The friends appointed produced the
following report to the Yearly Meeting which
was approved, to wit. We the committee on Indian concerns
Report that since the last yearly meeting we
have continued our exertions to promote the
concern of friends for effecting the civilization
of the Indian natives & the introduction of the
arts of husbandry amongst them & altho no great
progress appears since our last report yet we
hope there is ground of encouragment to
persevere in the benevolent work Some time after our last yearly meeting
the young men who had been engaged by friends
to assist the Indians at our settlement on the
Wabash returned and informed us that they had 
raised a good crop of corn which they
had previous to their leaving that place
secured in a crib- on their departure
from the station they were accompanyed
by several of the principal Indians of
the Village as far as Fort Wayne, at
which place on taking leave of them
these Indians expressed their gratitude
to friends for the kind assistance they
had furnished them and desired our young
men to inform us that they earnestly hoped
we would still continue our friendly aid
towards them From the information received it was
the united judgment of the committee that the
situation of the settlement required the further
attention of friends The same persons who were employed the
past season were accordingly engaged & having
set out early in the spring, reached the settlement
about the middle of the 4th month last. By
accounts received from them it appears that
the Indians were much pleased at their return
& they found the settlement in as good a situ
ation as could be expected, the corn which
had been the last fall secured in cribs 
would be very seasonable relief to divers of the
families in the Village who were much in
need of it at that time, having lost many of
their Hogs during the winter for want of food After solid deliberation on the important
concern confided to us it was the opinion of the
committee that a benefit would result from a
deputation being sent into that country in
order to ascertain the present disposition of the
Indians & the progress they have made in the
knowledge of agriculture & our friends Elisha
Tyson James Gillingham & David Grave were
accordingly nominated to that service & proceded
to make the proposed visit early in the last
spring; They arrived at Fort Wayne in the 5th
month, from which place they proceeded to
Dennis Station & were received in a friendly
manner by the Indians, divers of whom had
made considerable progress in the cultivation
of their lands, aided by white men paid out
of their annuities & some of them by their
own labour- The young men in the employ
of Friends at that place were engaged in
preparing for a crop of corn, and appeared to
be acting prudently, the Indians as well as whites
in the neighbourhood expressed satisfaction 
with their conduct since their residence
amongst them- These friends whilst at the station
had a conference with the Indians of the
Village and delivered a communication
addressed to them by the committee- The
white Loon a principal chief of the place
on behalf of himself & the others acknowledged
the propriety of what was said, but declined giving
a full reply until after the general council which
was soon after to be held at Fort Wayne, when a
particular reply he said would be made. They
likewise afterwards had a conference with a
deputation from the Miamy & Puttowattomy nations
at Fort Wayne at which time an address from
the committee to those nations was delivered to
them, as also a written communication from 
the friends themselves In reply the 5 Medals said that he
felt thankful to the great spirit for having
permited them to meet at that time and
expressed his satisfaction with what was said
but observed that as only a few of the princi
pal chiefs were present they could not reply 
to the speech delivered to them until after it was
laid before their general council and deliberated
on there when a full reply would be made
- neither of these have yet been recd. by us Whilst these friends were in that country
they were at times much discouraged on acct.
of the sorrowful effects of spirituous liquors
amongst the Indians for notwithstanding the
law of congress which was obtained some years
past in order to prevent this destructive article
being introduced into their country by the
Traders yet it is to be lamented that of
latter time they have obtained it by going
themselves into the state of Ohio and purchas
ing it there greatly to their injury & to the
obstruction of the object of our concern Since the return of our deputation
we have recd. letters from the young men
there informing that their crop of corn
&Vegetables look well as also those of the
Indians, they likewise inform that they have
assisted the principal chief of the village in
building a more comfortable House than he
had heretofore lived in, being nearly 2 stories
high with floors &Partition, and had moreover
aided another Indian in one which he
was building for himself. And several
of the other Indians having expressed a wish 
to remove a small distance out of the
Village in order to have separate fields and
better opportunity of raising stock they con
templated assisting them in building houses
for that purpose as soon as the crop
would be in a situation to admit of it
-our young men also inform that 2 of
the Indians had been induced to cultivate
their lands by the plough & that they believed
the late Visit made to them by friends
had been useful to them. Their prin
cipal chief observed that he loved friends
in his heart for the love they manifested
to the Indians We have examined the Treasurer
acct. and find an unexpended balance
in his hands of $265 36/100 exclusive of
the donation recd. from our brethren of
Great Britain Signed on behalf of the 
Committee

 P.S. we are free to inform the Yearly
Meeting that we apprehend an advantage
would arise from an addition to our members
which we submit to the Meeting Then adjourned to meet on the evening
of the 13th Inst. at the 7th hour in the evening 10mo 13 1808 Pursuant to adjournment the committee a
gain met present 27 members and our friends
James Wilson & Jessee Kersey from the Yearly
Meeting of Philadelphia It appears by a minute of the yearly
meeting now produced that the following friends
have been added to this committee to wit William
Wood, Samuel Test , Samuel Jones of West branch
John Howard , James Ellicott , Jesse Tyson and
William Kenworthy jr. Information being spread before the
committee that there are two settlements of the
Delaware nation of Indians on reservation
near Mohicken Johns lake whose situation claims
the sympathy of Friends, after deliberation
thereon it was concluded to appoint a com
mittee to make further enquiry into their
disposition &situation and report when in readiness
the following friends were accordingly appointed
to wit Horton Howard William Wood , John
Howard &Philip E. Thomas 
Then adjourned sine die. Balto. 11 mo 7th 1808 At a meeting of the committee on Indian con
cerns present 17 members A letter was received from William Wells 
dated 9 mo 30 last enclosing minutes of the proceedings
of the General Council of the Miami confederacy of 
Indians held at Fort Wayne 25 of the 9th month
which were read &refered to further consideration
also the copy of an address on behalf of the Miamis
Puttowattamy & Eal River Tribes of Indians requesting
that measures may be adopted to interdict the
sale of Spiritous Liquors to Indians in the State
of Ohio or Territories of Indiana or Michigan
from which places they say it is introduced
amongst them which being read &the com
mittee taking into view
the magnitude of this evil amongst them
concluded to appoint the following friends to prepare an essay of an address
to the legislature of Ohio on the subject & produce
it for the consideration of the next meeting to wit. Gerard T. Hopkins 
P.E Thomas James Gillingham Andw. Ellicott 
James Ellicott & John Ellicott Then adjourned to the 6th Hour in the
evening of the 9th Inst. At which time the
committee again met present 13 Members The friends appointed to prepare an Essay of
a Memorial to the legislature of Ohio on the subject
of restricting the sale of spiritous liquors to the
Indians produced the the following which was read &
approved to wit To the Legislature of the State of Ohio
The memorial of the committee on Indian con
cerns appointed by the Yearly Meeting of Friends
held in Baltimore for the western shore of Maryland
the adjacent parts of Pennsylvania &Virginia & the
state of Ohio. Respectfully Represents That a concern having several years 
past originated in our yearly Meeting to introduce among
some of the Indian Tribes bordering on your state
the most necessary acts of civil life, your Memorialists
were appointed by that Body to carry into effect this
desirable object, and according proceeded to perform
the service assigned them, but in the course of their efforts
it was found that the quantities of spiritous
Liquors with which those people were supplied by
Traders & others greatly counteracted every measure
devised to improve their situation, this being
abundantly confirmed in a speech delivered
to us by the Little Turtle the principal chief of
the Miamis (an extract from which is herewith
forwarded) your Memorialists in the year 1802 made
a representation of the case to congress, whereupon
that Body, duly appreciating the magnitude of
the evil, enacted a law authorising the Resident to prohibit the Traders
from carrying distilled Spirits into their country
this being immediately done they were for a time precluded in a great measure
from it, and the good effects soon became obvious
in the general improvement amongst them.
Sanguine hopes were now cherished that those un
happy people who had heretofore been a prey to
want and distress would be induced to abandon
their precarious mode of life, and turn their
attention to agriculture and the arts of civil
life for subsistence, which disposition seemed for
a time increasingly to pervade them, but as the
settlements of white People approached their villages
and hunting camps, Spiritious Liquors were again
brought within their reach, and they are now in the habit of procuring large 
quantities by going for it into the State of Ohio, 
the Indiana & Michigan Territories: This has
much arrested the progress of their improvement
and it is with deep concern we add that
they seem fast relapsing into their former habits &
your memorialists are of the opinion that
no exertion on their part will be likely to
produce much permanent advantages to the
Indians unless they can be restricted from
Spiritous Liquor; many of them are sensible of
its desolating effects and with us deplore its
ravages upon them, but are unable to prevent
its introduction into their country; they have
accordingly addressed a Memorial to the
President of the United States (a copy of which they
likewise transmited to us) intreating that
measures may be taken to prevent the sale
of this destructive article to any Indian within the
State of Ohio, or the Territories of Indiana or
Michigan. We have no doubt but that the
benevolent policy of the general Government
towards these people will induce it to exercise
its influence to prevent their obtaining
it in the latter Territories, we are therefore induced
respectfully to represent the forgoing facts to you, ear
nestly requesting your serious attention to the
subject, and that you will adopt such measures
for their benefit as to you may seem right & proper
under a solid consideration of the importance
of the proposed movement the committee after mature 
deliberation were of the judgment that it will be
most prudent to lay the subject before our Meeting
for sufferings for its sympathy & advice previous
to any further proceedure therein Then adjourned until 4th day the 16th Inst. at
the 3rd hour in the afternoon at which time the
committee again met present 8 Members The following minute from our Meeting
for sufferings being produced & read expressive
of that Meetings concurence with the 
foregoing address to the legislative of the state of Ohio if was
directed to be signed &forwarded. The contemplated memorial as essayed by
the committee on Indian concerns was again
read: after being deliberately &weightily considered
it was approved by the Meeting &that committee
made the channel through which the memorial
is to be presented to the Legislature of Ohio Extracted from the minutes of the Meeting
for Sufferings held by adjournment the 16th of the
11 mo 1808 by GT Hopkins Clk The clerk was accordingly
directed to transmit our Memorial to the
assembly of Ohio under the care of some sui
table person who would use the necessary care in
laying it before that Body.
Then adjourned 12 Mo 23 1808 
 At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
concerns present 11 Members The committee appointed to enquire into the
situation & disposition of that portion of the Delaware
Tribe of Indians, residing on the waters of Mohicken
John, reported that they had ascertained the Title
of the these Indians, to the 13 sections of Land reserved
for their use by a law of Congress, was good, so long
as they may continue to occupy &cultivate the
same; They further reported, that part of their num
ber had had a conference with some of them, &
that their suffering situation claims our sympathy.
It appeared they were desirous to receive aid form
Friends, and disposed to cultivate their Lands; the
white people having began to form settlements
beyond them, they will in a little time be precluded
from obtaining a living as heretofore by Hunting,
in which case, they must either have recourse to
agriculture for a subsistence, or abandon their
Lands, should they come to the latter determi
nation, their title to them will be forfeited.
The subject after consideration was refered to a future
meeting of the committee A letter was rec. from J. Johnson dated 10mo 19
last which being read was satisfactory. John Shaw attended and on behalf of himself
and Isaace Griffith reported, that they had gone out
to the Station on the Wabash, early in the last spring
and remained there until about the middle of
last month, during which time they had raised a
crop of good corn, of between 5&600 Bushels, which 
was carefully secured before they came away, they
also raised some Hemp, Tobacco, Potatoes, Turnips &a
variety of Garden Vegetables. The corn was not dis
tributed amongst the Indians this fall, on acct.
of many of them being absent, on Hunting expi
ditions, & their believing it would be more
serviceable in the spring; He likewise informed, 
that they had aided the Indians in building
several Houses, after the crop was in a situation
to admit of their attention being withdrawn
from it, and that some of the Indians appeared
industrious and worked steadily, but the corrupting
and debasing influence of Spiritous liquors upon them,
which most pernicious article, they continue to
introduce in large quantities into their Villages
remains to be the principal obstacle to their ge
neral improvement; and if means are not adopted,
to prevent their easy access, to this bane
of civilization & morality, there does not appear
a very encouraging prospect of their progressing
much in improvement, they however appeared generally
thankful, & expressed their obligations, for our assistence
&solicit a continuance of our friendly aid. John Shaw also made a report of his observations
and enquires respecting a suitable situation for a 
permanent establishment, should friends continue
to pursue their efforts, towards the civilization of 
the Indians in the neighbourhood of Fort Wayne,
which was refered for further consideration 
James Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins &Elias Ellicott 
were appointed to examine &adjust the acct.
of the expenses incured by John Shaw & Isaac
Griffith and report to the next meeting of
the Committee Then adjourned to the 6th Hour in the evening
of the 25th Inst. when the committee again met
present 12 Members The general state of the concern refused to
us coming under solid consideration, after some time
spent in deliberation thereon, it was concluded
to adjourn until tomorrow evening at the 6th Hour
when the committee again met present 11 Members
the Little Turtle & Rusheville chiefs of the Miamy nation
of Indians, the Beaver & Crow , Chiefs of the Delawares & 
Marpuck a chief of the Puttowattomies The committee addressed these chiefs in the following
Speech, through one of its members Brothers
I feel a degree of thankfulness in my
heart to the Great Spirit that my life has been
lengthened out, to have an opportunity this evening
of taking you by the hand, & particularly the Little
Turtle, whom I remember some years ago, siting
in council with. I think I may say I have felt a
portion of that love which then operated upon
my heart attended by a strong desire for the welfare
of you my red brethren: The conference which
we then had, has been strongly impressed upon my
mind; I have often remembered our communications,
and particularly the solitude expressed by them, at 
that time, that our society would afford some assis
tence to our red brethren, in instructing them in
the cultivation of the Earth, and in the knowledge
of some of the more useful arts of civil life. Brothers 
The Turtle no doubt remembers his then
having expressed to us his regret that
spiritous liquors were so frequently introduced
amongst the Indians, by the traders, and his then
requesting the aid of our Society, in order to re
present to the Government, the baneful effects
of that pernicious article & he no doubt also
recollects, that some of us, in consequence thereof
attended congress in company with him & the other
chiefs Brothers
In consequence of the expectations
then made, a law was passed, empowering the
President of the United States to restrain the traders
from furnishing that article to the Indians, &
we were there united with you in the opinion, that
while it was so freely used amongst our red Brethren
it would be a considerable obstruction to their
improvement. As soon as that difficulty seemd
to be removed, we apprehended it was time
for us to take some steps towards carrying the
concern of our religious society into effect, and
as we were not fully acquainted with the situ
ation of of our red Brethren we concluded to
send some of our Brothers into your Country, where
they had a conference with divers of the chiefs of our 
red brethren, and a situated was pointed out
where we should commence our operations &
make an establishment, for it appeared to us
that the most effectual way of carrying our views
into execution, was to begin our efforts at particular
spot, and it was then our contention that when
our red brethren should become sufficiently
instructed at that place, (so as to be able to
do without our assistance) to remove to some
other village in order to continue our aid Brothers! From the report of those who were
appointed by the society to carry on our ope
rations on the Wabash, it has never appeard to
us, that the time was yet come, in which it
would be proper for our young men to desert
that establishment, and go to any other place. It
may not be best to withhold from our red brothers
that the society has met with considerable dis
couragments on being informed, that notwithstanding
 the benevolent measures of the Government in order
to prevent the introduction of spiritous liquors
amongst the Indians, some of them, go amongst
the white people and bring to their villages large
supplies of them, this information induced us to
write to our red brethren, and inform them of
the discouragments we were under, and to endeavor
to impress upon their minds, the necessity there was
for all those, who desire to make improvements in
agriculture and other useful arts of civil life, to
decline the use of spiritous liquors, but we have been 
satisfactorily informed, that tho these communicating
had not reached the Chiefs, before the commencement
of their general council, they had themselves taken
the subject into consideration, and addressed a
petition to the President of the United States 
desiring that the people of the State of Ohio
& Territories of the United States, might be
restricted from selling spiritous liquors to the
Indians. This would have operated as an
encouragement to us, to persevere in the busi
ness which we had undertaken, had we not
been informed by a communication from
Fort Wayne, being the proceedings of the general
council, that some of the Indians were disposed
to dispence with our further services- As this
is the situation of the business at present when
we head of the arrival of our red brethren in
Baltimore this day it was pleasing to us for we
wished an opportunity of this sort with them, that
we might sit down together and endeavour to fal together. And
I hope as we are now here met in council, we
may speak freely, and that if our red brethren
should have met with any thing, which has not
been to then satisfaction, in our intercourse with
them, they would freely open to us their minds Brothers! As our concern has led us to sympathise
with our red brethren in different parts of this
Country, we have never found ourselves confined 
in our prospects, and if at any time, any become
dissatisfied with us, we desire that they would
freely commuicate to us their dissatisfaction, yet
tho' we are sensible our motives are pure, having
no prospect of reaping any advantages to ourselves,
in the prosecution of this concern, but that
peace of mind, which will ever be the attendant
upon every act of benevolence, our red brothers
must no doubt see, that after having had our
minds exercised on their accounts, and seen
engaged in endeavours to promote their benefit
so long in their past of the continent, it would
be a disagreeable circumstance to us, to seperate
ourselves from them; but if they are dissatisfied,
and wish us to withdraw, from them, we shall
turn our attention to some other quarter of 
the country, in which our red brothers reside. As
the concern has arisen from pure love in our
hearts, flowing towards the red people, it does not
appear, that we can give over our exertions, wen
if discouragements are thrown in our way, but if
we are rejected in one place we shall turn to
those who are willing to receive us, we now therefore
wish our brothers to use that freedom, which one
brother ought to use to another, in communiting 
without reserve their sentiments to us To which the Turtle replyed My brothers the Quakers! In rising to salute you, I
feel happy, & thank the great spirit who has put it
into our power, to take each other by the hand
once more. All that you have said to us is pleasing 
and nothing bad Brothers! This is not the first time that I have
heard you speak as you now speak; when you
spoke these words to us some years ago we then
answered you Brothers! when you first spoke to us you
pointed to us the deplorable situation of our
people, in a striking manner. you enumerated
these great evils which were amongst us,
amongst others, you mentioned that of spiritous
liquors which daily destroys us Brothers! we believed at that time, that you
were perfectly sensible of our situation. we told
you that the evils that existed amongst us
occasioned by strong drink, were too heavy for us to
remove, and we told you that if you really
were concerned, as we believed you to be, in
wishing us well, you would assist us in geting
clear of this great evil Brothers! we told you, that we could not
restrain our young men from drinking spiritous
liquors, but that we believed, that as the white
people were the makers of this great evil, they
could keep it out of the way of our people, so
that they could get none Brothers! You say that you went with us to
the seat of Government and that a stop was
put to the introduction of liquor amongst us
as we wished. But brothers I have never seen this
except in the neighbourhood of Fort Wayne; there
only our young men have not been able to get 
supplied with liquor. They get supplies 
from the mouth of the great Miamy to
Detroit, and down the Ohio to the mouth
of the Wabash and up that river: and there
is no place exempt from liquor except Fort Wayne. Brothers! You have now asked us if we
had any cause of complaint against you
in the execution of the endeavours you have
and to render us service, our answer to this is
that we have none. I must now tell you, as
I before told you, when I talked with you, 
that there were various opinions amongst us
respecting the advantages which you had offered
to us. Brothers we have no complaint to make
against you, or any thing that you have done
for us: we are not dissatisfied with you, but
if any thing has gone wrong, and your good
intentions towards us have been thwarted, it has
been owing to the conduct of those amongst us, who
wish to continue us, in our present situation, &
prevent you from doing those good things which
you wish to do for us Brothers! You have told us to speak freely,
we do so, what I now say comes from my heart. Your
red brethren the Indians love you: It is true some
of them have said that they were willing to dispense
with your services, but this is not the unannimous
opinion of your red brethren; Those who have said
this have never received any services from you.- as
they have recd. none, consequently they have none to 
dispense with. I am not now prepared to say
anything more to you, but shall carry home
to my people all that you have said to us Then adjourned until tomorrow morning at the 10th Hour when the committee again met
present 8 members The friends appointed to examine & adjust the
acct. of the expences incured by John Shaw & Isaac
Griffith reported that they had attended to the
service & find a balance due them of $405 36/100
which the Treasurer was directed to pay Then adjourned until tomorrow evening at the 6th Hour when the committee again
meet present 12 members & the Little Turtle 
the principal Chief of the Miamy nation
of Indians The Turtle was informed that we having for several
years carried on our operations on the Wabash &
so instructed our brothers there, that we hoped
they would before long be in a situation to do
without much assistance from us, we therefore began
to think of turning our views to some other Towns
and it was our wish to know, if it was his
desire we should render any aid to his vallage In reply he made many expressions of thanks
and of his sense of our kindness, and the benefits
those of his people whom we had had under our care
had derived from our aid, He also stated his entire
conviction of the correctness of our ideas respecting 
the means of improving their condition & inform
ed us that whenever we might feel ourselves
disposed to aid his Town, he would seize our
offer with both hands, and appeared very
desirous of receiving assistance from us. He
further stated that he hoped, that the love
which has subsisted between the old men, of his
people & us would continue to cement our
children, & childrens children, & that for his part,
he should never forget us, whilst the great
spirit might be pleased to continue his existence After he had retired, the general subject
refered to us coming again under consideration,
it was concluded to appoint Gerard T. Hopkins ,
Elisha Tyson , James Gillingham George Ellicott 
John Ellicott &Philip E Thomas to consider
of the propriety of our procuring a piece of
Land for a permanent settlement, & reporting to
a future Meeting of the committee A letter was received from the Meeting for
sufferings of Philadelphia informing that they had
finally divided the money received from our brethren
of Great Britain & remited to their care for the
benevolent purpose of promoting the civilization & improvement
of the Indian natives and that the
additional sum of $4694 44/100 was alloted to our
use, which amt. they left us at liberty to draw for
at sight on Henry Drinker .- Elias Ellicott our
Treasurer was accordingly desired to draw for that
sum, and the clerk directed to furnish him
with a copy of this minute 
Then adjourned until tomorrow at the 2nd hour
in the afternoon when the committee again met
present 13 members
The friends appointed at the last meeting of
the committee, to consider of the propriety of our
obtaining a permanent settlement in the Indian
country, for the purpose of carrying on our future
operations, towards promoting their civilization
& improvement, produced the following report, which
was united with, & the following friends appointed
to pay such further attention to the subject as may
appear
necessary to wit, Evan Thomas Elisha Tyson 
& George Ellicott who were directed to report to
a future meeting of the committee, viz. In conformity to our appointment, we have
taken into consideration the prospect of the com
mittee, to become possessed of a tract of Land
contiguous to the Indians, in order to form a
permanent settlement from whence, our aid can
be more conveniently and advantageously directed
to them; after the best view we have been capable
of taking of the subject, we are united in sen
timent, that the time has come, in which such
a measure is expedient. we propose that the committee endeavour
to obtain a tract of Land suitable for a Farm
near Fort Wayne, and in order that full information
may be obtained, we propose that a deputation
from the committee wait upon the proper public
officer, ascertain the practicability of procuring 
such a piece of land not exceeding 1000 acres
and the terms upon which it may be purchased
and if it be procured obtain such information
of the divisions of the reservation, as may enable
the committee to locate a farm suitable to
our views which we submit to the committee Signed Elisha Tyson James Gillingham Geo. Ellicott John Ellicott Philip E Thomas The situation of that portion of the Delaware
Tribe of Indians residing on reservations near
Mohicken Johns lake, being again brought into view
the subject, after deliberation was refered to our
sub committee, who were directed to correspond with
the committee on Indian concerns of Philada, &
furnish them with all the information, 
which has reached us respecting the situation
of these Indians, in order to interest our brethren
there, to extend some assistence to them, as we
apprehend they are more properly objects of their
care. Elisha Tyson Elias Ellicott Gerard T. Hopkins 
George Ellicott & Philip E Thomas were appointed
to invest the additional money alloted to us by the Meeting for
Sufferings of Phila. as our proportion of the fund
raised by our brethren of Great Britain for the
benevolent purpose of promoting the improvement
of the Indian nations & report of their care to the next 
Meeting of the committee Then adjourned until 7th day evening the 31 Inst.
when the committee again meet present 9 members & the
little Turtle principal cheif of the Miamis The Turtle started to the committee, that since
his arrival at the present time in this city, he had recd.
many proofs of the strong friendship of his brothers
the Quakers for the Indians; and that notwith
standing many of his people, had rendered themselves
unworthy of our regard, by paying no attention
to our advice & some of them even had rejected our aid
yet he had observed that our love for them appeared
not to be diminuished. He then expressed his
obligations for the personal regard we had manifested
for him, and informed the committee that as they
had, been so kind as to express a willingness to ex
tend some aid to his village, he would take the
liberty to point out the mode which would most
satisfactorily meet his wishes, this he said was, to
errect some kind of mill there, either to go by
Horses or water as we might judge most proper. This
he said would render an important service to his
people & be highly gratifying to himself The committee informed him that they
would confer together on the subject he had proposed
and when prepared would give him an answer; upon
which he retired The committee having taken into consideration
the proposal from the Turtle ,- after a free conference 
on the subject, were unitedly of the opinion
that it will be right to gratify him, as soon as
we become in a situation to accomplish it-
James Gillingham , James Ellicott & Philip E
Thomas were therefore appointed to prepare a
suitable reply to him & produce it to the 
next Meeting of the committee Then adjourned until tomorrow evening at
the 6th Hour when the committee again met
present 9 members The friends appointed to prepare a reply to
the Turtles application for a mill produced the
following which was approved & delivered to him
to wit To our brother the Little Turtle Since the first time we took each other by the
hand several years ago, we have always felt a
strong solicitude for the welfare of our red brethren
and an ardent desire to render them every assistance
in our power. Brother! It is this disposition towards them, which
has led us into their country, and we have every
year since that time kept some persons employed to
instruct them in those things which we apprehended
would promote their comfort & improvement Brother! we have already informed them, that
our means are not great, and that we have never
found ourselves in a situation to extend our opera
tions to more than one Village at a time Brother! It was by the agreement of our red
brethren that we commenced our operations on
the Wabash- and they have been informed that 
we have not heretofore, thought our brothers at
that place sufficiently instructed to admit of our
withdrawing from them Brother! As soon as we believed the time was
approaching, when the situation of our brothers
there, would admit of our extending assistance to
some other place, we turned our views to the
Turtles Town as the next which should claim
our attention Brother! our brothers on the Wabash & us have
had time and opportunity to get fully acquainted
with each other, and in proportion as our know
ledge of one another has increased, our love for
each other has been strengthened Brother! They have signified to us, that they
are greatly thankful for the aid we have given
them, and they earnestly intreat us not to with
draw from them, we must therefore still continue
to render them some help, until they become
stronger & better able to help themselves Brother! Our brothers on the Wabash have
now got a large piece of ground cleared & under
fences, and they are in some measure instructed
how to cultivate it; They will therefore we hope
begin to be able to do with less help from us
we have listened with attention to the request
of our brother to build him a mill, and as we
feel great love for him, and a strong disposition
to meet his wishes, as far as in our power, we
have concluded to do this for him, as we may find 
ourselves in a situation to accomplish it Brothers! we will therefore endeavour to divide
our aid between the Wabash & the Turtles Town -
our brother must not expect the mill to be built
immediately, we must first direct an exami
nation to be made of the situation at his Village
before we can determine what kind of a one
can best be put up for him- Perhaps there may
not be a place for a water mill; this we will
enquire into Brother! After we shall have made the necessary
examination, we will then determine on the
kind of mill most proper, and inform our Brother
thereof. We request our brother will accept the assurances
of our sincere & affectionate regard: we rejoice that
he and us have been permited to have an oppor
tunity of again taking one another by the hand,
and renewing those friendly sentiments, which
we before entertained towards each other, and
our desire to the Great Spirit is, that he will
preserve our brother, through the long journey he
has before him, and return him safe to the bosom
of his family &people.
The Turtle replyed as follows My Brothers! The communication you have just
made to me is highly pleasing, and I return you 
my sincere thanks Brothers! You observe that your brothers on the
Wabash are unwilling to part with you- this
I know to be true, and I rejoice that you still retain
your friendship for them, notwithstanding attempts have
been made to prejudice you against them, and the 
discouragements which you have had to encounter Brothers! I believed the building of a mill was the
best thing you can do for my people, I have therefore
asked it of you; I think it will encourage them to
raise large crops of corn & perhaps wheat, and it will
certainly afford a great convenience to those who
reside in the neighbourhood of my Village Brothers! I cannot omit again expressing to you my
thanks- I shall carry your words home & repeat
them to my people. He then retired Balto. 1 mo 5 1809 
At a Meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns present 12 members Hendricks Aupomut a chief of the Mohickeny
Tribe of Indians attended & informed the committee
that he had requested the present opportunity
with them in order to solicit assistance
& advice in the business which had occasioned
his present visit to those parts, he then commini
cated an interesting account of the present
situation & disposition of those Indians who
reside on White river of his future prospects
in regard to them and informed that a part
of those Indians consisted of the scattered remains
of the Nanticokes who he said still possessed 
certain Lands on the Eastern Shore of this State
which it was their desire might be disposed of 
and the proceeds remited to them; They had accord
ingly appointed him as their attorney to accom
plish this object & he had made a visit to the
seat of Government in this State in order to
possess himself of the necessary information
respecting their Title and its Value but for
want of the necessary inteligence he had
found himself unable to proceed The committee taking into consideration
the circumstances of his care, concluded to
appoint Andrew Ellicott jr to go with him
to Annopolis if necessary & render him such assistance
as he may find practicable & report his
care to a future Meeting of the committee
Then ajourned At a Meeting of the committee on
Indian concerns 2 mo 6 1809 Present 16 members The friend appointed to assist Hendrick
Aupaumut reported that he had paid atten
tion to the subject and rendered him the
necessary aid The sub committee informed that they 
had had a full conference with Hendrick
Aupamut and recd. from him the following
statement of the views of himself & the nation
of which he is chief Whereas certain of my friends at this place who
have the good of the Indians at heart, have
requested me to state the causes which induced
me & my companions to visit our western alies
I therefore feel it to be my duty to state as
follows- 1st I and the principal men of my nation
do firmly believe that it was the will of the
good & great spirit to unite our ancestors
with the the ancestors of the Delawares- Monsey
 Esopus & Waupug Nations, and enabled them
to enter into a covenant of friendship, which
connected them in one confederacy, which
friendship their ancestors & ours have never vio
lated Our ancestors were enabled to establish a 
permanent praise with the different tribes
of Indians (to wit) the Miamies- Potawatimies
 Chipeways- Ottawas- Sux- Musquakies or foxes
 Kickapoos- Kaskaskies & Piankeshas who bear
tradition to us as their Grandfathers & we call
them grandchildren which peace has been
maintained ever since as also with the Wyandots
 Shawanese- and the southern tribes 3d I and rest
of the chiefs of my nation together with our
young men are desirous to maintain peace and
unity among these nations- And the articles of
the treaty of peace with the U.S- We found many
of these Indians in a deplorable situation these
many years past- And we are sensible our good
wishes can never do them any good without our 
utmost exertions indeed 4th The history of the indians since the Europeans
first settled on this Island as well as our own
experience convinces us that all the different
tribes would decrease until they become extinct
as nations, unless they can be prevailed on to
relinquish the old rough path which they have
been following and get into the path which
leads to peace & happiness 5th My Co-chief and our councellers being impres
sed with the above sentiments held a general
Council on the subject and believed it to be
their duty to appoint me together with three of 
our counsellors &five principal young men
to visit the above mentioned tribes in order to
renew the covenant of friendship which had
subsisted between our ancestors & theirs and to
deliver to them the best counsel we could give them
I believed it to be my duty to comply with the
request of my nation as well as the impressions
which I often felt on my heart, I therefore with
the eight men of my nation proceeded on our
journey in Oct 1803- and having renewed
our covenant of friendship with the Delawares &
 Monseys as also other tribes they desired that I and
my nation should remove and dwell with them
on the Land on white river which tract had
been granted to this confederacy by the Miamies
& other tribes at their general council near Post 
Vincennes forty years ago 6th Influenced by the same sentiments my nation
again appointed me, also John Jacobs - Jacob 
Nannuhsstang Wm Noruuqshen Ebenezer Maun-
nautheet & Robert Sheket to visit those tribes
for the purpose of doing all we could to pro
mote their welfare, and we left our homes &
families in July 1807 their situation appeared
to gloomy that I felt it my duty to stay with
them and to use my utmost endeavous to
promote the useful arts of agriculture amongst 
them-And they are inclined to learn them
and greatly desire we should liver and die
with them in that country I have found a willing
mind to undertake to make a proper trial
to draw them into the path of civilization
I accordingly left five of my young men in
their country to help the delawares this winter
to cut timber for nails until I return to
them in the spring- I stated the foregoing circumstances
to the President of the U-S- in substance
and informed you already of the encourage
ment he gave me you will percieve in
order to proceed in this laudable work it is
essential my five young men should have
some encouragement from the government or
friends- J Jacobs as I told you is an approved
school master, and is well qualified to teach
the children to read & write & J Naunuhtaug 
is an ingenious Carpenter- understands the
management of a grist and saw mill- And 
can keep them in repair- the other three young men
are active and industrious and can use the axe 
and hoe on a farm. they left home with me
well cloathed but before I came away they
were nearly naked but in order to encourage
& make them as comfortable as I could while
I am absent from them I had on 50 dols
worth of cloath from Johnston for them to
& should be remembered that we raised 
nothing but corn last summer in that country
and we wish to be diligent at our work
yet we cannot work hard without substantial
food now if the men should be obliged to
Hunt for food or Cloath they must of neces
sity neglect the farming business, and if I 
cannot obtain some supplies of provision
before the crops come on they will suffer &
indeed if they could not hear some encourage
ment I fear my young men will abandon
this object & return to their own homes-
I therefore earnestly hope my friends will
take this into their serious consideration
And I do firmly believe that by the blessing
of the great good Spirit we may do much
good for these poor Indians- my hopes &
expectations for their future advancements
are greatly strengthened from various cir
cumstances among other things. The delawares
and the other Indians at the white river
in a general council held by the Chiefs & 
head warriors, with the young men at that
place last August they passed a law by
general consent that if any person should bring 
any liquors to our town it should be imme
diately spilled on the ground and the
person should loose it- As my friends will probably wish to
know what assistance we may most stand
in need of. I will observe that I expect
about 10 barrels of pork 12 Barrels of flour
& two bushels of salt will be nessisary to
subsist the Indians until their crop will
come on this if it is furnished to me it
shall only be distributed to those who
will quit hunting and closely apply
Themselves to work- I should like to have
about eight breeding sows & two Boars. Some
grass seeds some oats & wheat seeds, Some
potatoes some flax seed and the means
of procuring some cloathing for my 5 young
men the whole of these things can be got
from Hamilton about 50 or 60 miles from
our village at vastly less expence than at
 Fort Wayne- Hendricks Aupaumut 
Chief of the
Muhhiconnick Nation Baltimore 11th Jan 1808 The sub committee further informed that
after communication on the request of Hendrick Au
paumut for some assistance towards enabling him
to prosecute his views in regard to the Indians on
the White River they had concluded it would be best to
make known his situation to the Government
who had thereupon so far patronised his undertaking
as to direct the Indian agent at Fort Wayne 
to yield him the necessary aid to enable him
to carry into effect his plan The committee after solid deliberation on
the present situation of the concern refered to
us by the yearly meeting, were united in the
judgment that under present circumstances it
will be most prudent to confine our ope
rations for the present season to the employing
of two persons for the purpose of aiding the
Indians on the Wabash 2 or 3 months in
puting in their crop and geting it so far
forward as that they will able to cultivate
&secure it afterwards themselves. The sub com
mittee were accordingly directed to give this in
formation to that part of the committee who
reside on the west side of the mountains and
to request John Johnson to employ on our behalf
two suitable men for that purpose and au
thorise him to draw on our Treasurer for the
Amt. of expence that may be incured = They were
also desired to direct the last years crop which
had been secured in cribs to be divided amongst
the Indians at the village in such way as the
chiefs & John Shaw might think right and
deliverd to them as a present from Friends
Then adjourned At a meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns 3 mo 12 1809 present 10 members The committtee appointed to invest the money
recd. from our Brethren of Great Britain in
aid of our exertions towards promoting the
civilization of the Indians produced the following

as directed written to those of our members
who reside West of the mountains & to John Johnson 
informing them of the Judgment which
we had come to respecting our proceedings toward
the Indians for the present season A letter from John Johnson dated 2 mo 20th
was received & read & refered for further consi
deration The friend appointed to transmit our
Memorial to the Legislature of Ohio on the
subject of interdicting the ale of spiritous
Liquors to Indians within that state informed
that he had forwarded it as directed and that
the following Law had been passed by the assembly
viz An act to prevent the selling of Spirituous

Then Adjourned At a meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns 10 mo 10 1809 present 20 members and our
friend Samuel Emlen from the yearly meeting of
Philadelphia Geo Ellicott P.E. Thomas C. Bentley , Horton
Howard, David Grave , Henry Mills & Jesse Hughes 
were appointed to examine & adjust the Treasurers
accounts & prepare a report to the Yearly Meeting 
now siting to be produced at a future meeting
of the committee Then adjourned until tomorrow evening at the 7th Hour, when the committee again met
present 23 Members and our friend John James 
from Philadelphia The friends appointed to prepare a report
to the Yearly Meeting now siting produced
the following which was read and approved to wit To the Yearly Meeting now siting
The committee on Indian concerns report
That the young men who had been sent out
to assist & instruct the Indians returned about the first
of the present year and informed that they
had gone out early in the spring and remained
at our Station on the Wabash, until about
the middle of the 11th month last during which
time they had raised a crop of good corns of
between 5 & 600 Bushels in the Ear which was
carefully secured before they came away- They
had also raised a variety of Vegetables which
were given to the Indians. The corn also
has since been distributed among such of
the Indian families as appeared most in need
of it- our young men further informed that
they had aided the Indians in building several
Houses after the crop was in a situation to admit
of their attention being withdrawn from it, and 
that some of them appeared industrious and
worked steadily, but the corrupting and debasing
influence of Spiritous liquors upon them which
article they at that time continued to introduce
in large quantities into their villages was found
to be a great obstacle in the way of their
general improvement, and it was the judgment
of these friends that if means could not
be adapted to prevent their easy access to
this bane of civilization and morality, there
did not appear a very encouraging prospect
of their progressing much in improvement
they however appeared generally thankful
and expressed their obligations for the assistance
they had received The committee also recd. a communication
from the Miami Puttowattomi Eal river & other
nations of Indians N.W. of the State of Ohio
informing that an address which we had some
time before forwared to them on the subject of
the admission of spiritous liquors into their
country had been received and interpreted to the
different Tribes when assembled in their General
council in the 9th mo 1808 and that they had on
a full consideration of the subject, unitedly
agreed to Petition the Government of the U. States 
to interdict the future transportation of that
article into their country, which petition
they forwarded to us and at the same time
solicited the aid of Friends in promoting such
measures as might hereafter relieve them from
the dreadful consequences of this great distroyer
amongst them The committee taking into consideration
the destructive effects which during 
their intercourse with the Indians
they had observed to flow from their excessive use
of spiritious liquors, and which had greatly
paralised every exertion for their improvement
were unanimously of the opinion that it
became their duty to pay such attention to
the application received as might hereafter tend
to relieve these unhappy people from the
calamities and distresses which they were suffering
from distilled spiritous liquors. We accordingly
presented the memorial of the Indians to the
President of the U.S. who readily engaged to use
his influence with the Government of Ohio
and of Territories of Indiana & Michigan
from whence the Indians principally drew
their supplies of this article, to obtain
such relief and could be procured. The
committee also with the concurence of the 
Meeting for Sufferings forwarded a memorial
to legislature of Ohio requesting its attention
to the subject and that it would adopt such
measures for the relief of the Indians
as might appear beneficial & proper and
it is with great satisfaction we can inform
the Yearly Meeting, that a law was obtained
which intirely interdicts under heavy penalties
the transportation of any intoxicating liquors
out of that state for the purpose of being
Vended to Indians, and also the furnishing any
to Indians who may come within the
limits of the state- We have also the satis
faction to add that we have understood that
similar laws have been passed in the Territories,
and as it was principally from these places
that the Indians obtained their supplies of 
Spiritous liquors the committee indulges the
hope that they will not hereafter have to
struggle against the powerful obstacles which
this most pernicious article has heretofore
thrown in their way and which had discouraged
them from extending much assistance the
present year, they therefore cannot but rejoice
in the prospect which now opens before them 
and feel strongly animated to continue their
efforts with increased diligence & zeal The committee may further inform that
 a considerable number of the principal
cheifs of the different nations of Indians
bordering on the United States passed through
this city during the last winter amongst
these were several of the chiefs of those Tribes
with whom we have had an acquaintance
and divers conferences took place between us
and them on the general subject of our
concern. From the information which they
gave us it appeard that a disposition is pre
vailing amongst their people to turn their
attention towards the cultivation of their
lands, and to establish themselves in fixed
habitations, and we are strengthened in the
opinion that as the great obstacle to their
improvement has we trust been removed this
disposition will continue to gain ground amongst
them and that notwithstanding we have had
many discouraging circumstances to encounter
yet there is encouragement for Friends to
persevere in the benevolent work they have
engaged in and a comfortable hope that
as we are favoured patiently to abide under
the weight of this concern our labours will 
ultimately be crowned with success We have since the last yearly meeting recd.
from the meeting for sufferings of Phila. the
additional sum of $4694 44/100 which they had
alloted to us as our proportion of the money
raised by our brethren of Great Britain and
remited to them for the purpose of aiding the
exertions of Friends in America in promoting
the civilization and improvement of the
Indians, this with the money before recd. has
been invested in Stock and is held in Trust
for the use of the Committee
We have examined the Treasurer a/c and
find in his hands a Balance of $1476 59 Exclu
sive of the amount of Stock held by the
Committeee Signed by direction &on behalf
of the Committee By P.E Thomas Clk to
the Committee
10 mo 11 1809 Then adjourned until the 12 Inst. at the 6th
hour in the evening when the committee again
met present 24 members and our friend Charles
Shoemaker from the Yearly Meeting of Philadelphia The situation of that portion of the Dela
ware Tribe of Indians residing near Mohicken
Johns Lake being again brought into view and 
the committee being informed that Friends
of Phila. yearly meeting have declined extending
any care towards them, after consideration
it was concluded to refer the subject of
their request to the care of the following friends
to wit Jonathan Wright (of Miami) Israel
Wilson, Henry Mills , Jonas Cattell David
Grave Jonas Cadwalader Horton Howard 
William Wood Samuel Test , Samuel Jones 
& John Howard who were desired to make
them a visit if way should open &
left at liberty to extend such assistance to
them as they may judge expedient and
draw on our Treasurer for the Amount
of Expence that may be incured
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee
on Indian concerns 2 mo 5 1810 present 17 Members Information was communicated
to the committee that letters had been recd.
from the Indian agent at Fort Wayne and also
from John Shaw stating that from the disposition
which appears at this time to prevail amongst
the Indians on the Wabash there was not a
prospect of much benefit being likely to result 
to these Indians from friends continuing their aid
to them. And at the same time remarking that the
settlement of the Shawanese at Wapakanetta were
very anxious to recieve assistance from Friends, and
had very generally manifested a disposition to
turn their attention to agriculture and had already
made some progress in the cultivation of their
Lands, these letters likewise inform that a Grist 
and Saw Mill had begun at this settlement
and may with a moderate Expence be compleated The sub-committee reported that on rect. 
of these Letters, they likely had informed that Secretary of
War that we might probably be induced to direct
our efforts at least for a time to the assistance
of these Indians provided the Government should
approve of it, and they now produced his reply
in which he expresses his intire approbation of
our removing there, and at the same time relin
quishes to the direction of the Society the whole
of the public property and materials which
had been collected there for the use and benefit
of the Indians. After solid consideration the committee
were united in judgment that it will be proper
to withdraw for a time from the wabash and
direct our exertions to the assistance of the settlement 
at Wapakanetta, and in order that our views
and prospects may be fully communicated to these
Indians, the following Friends were appointed to
make them a visit, and hold such conference
with them as may appear necessary- They were
also left at liberty to engage such assistance
as they may apprehend expedient to afford to
them, and also have the Mills compleated
as early as convenient to wit Elisha Tyson ,
Thomas Moore , John Ellicott , Asa Moore , Edward
Stabler, James Ellicott & Jessee Hughes 
Then adjourned At a meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns 5th mo 7 1810 present 17 members The friends appointed at last meeting to
visit, and if way opened, extend assistance to the
settlement of Indians at Wapakanetta, informed
that this service had not yet been performed
They were therefore continued and Henry Mills 
added to that committee
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
concerns 10 mo 15 1810 present 21 members and our
friend George Dilwin & John Brown from the
Yearly Meeting of Phila. The friends appointed to visit the Indians
at Wapakennetta reported that way had not 
opened to perform this service- The subject
was refered to the further consideration of the
committee A report was received from the
friends who were appointed to make a
visit to the Indians settld near Mohicken
Johns Lake which was satisfactory, and
the same friends Continued to extend
such further attention and assistance to
these Indians as they may judge expedient
and draw on our Treasurer for the
amount of Expence incured and report
from time to time to the committee Gerard T. Hopkins , George Ellicott , Asa
Moore, Andrew Ellicott & James Gillingham 
were appointed to prepare a report to the
yearly Meeting examine the Treasurer a/c
and report to a future meeting of the
committee Then adjourned to the 7th Hour
tomorrow evening at which time the
committee again met The friends appointed to prepare
a report to the Yearly Meeting produced
the following which was approovd & 
directed to be signed by the Clerk This printed report is tipped-in. To the Yearly Meeting, now sitting.
The committee on Indian concerns have agreed to inform, that after
their last report they received information, that from a change of cir-
cumstances which had taken place among the Indians at the Wabash,
it was not likely that any further endeavours for their assistance could
be continued to advantage- and therefore, after solidly considering the
subject, we were united in believing that it would be best, at least for
a time, to discontinue our efforts in their favour, under the hope, how-
ever, that the causes which have led to this suspension, may only be
temporary, having, as we have understood, been produced by the de-
lusive counsels of an Indian among them stiled a prophet , and whose
influence, we hope, may prove to be of a transient nature. The committee also inform, that having received information that a
number of Shawanees, at Wapakonetta, on the Auglaize, had mani-
fested a disposition to turn their attention to agriculture, and appeared
desirous that the assistance of Friends might be extended to them ; and,
as our efforts on the Wabash were at present suspended after atten-
tively considering the subject, it was judged expedient to nominate
some of our number to make them a visit, and though way has not yet
opened for that to be accomplished, the committee feel free to observe,
that little or no loss has been sustained ; as the minds of the Indians
in that quarter have been too much agitated during the past summer,
(the delusive influence of the person beforementioned having been also
attempted at this settlement) to afford a prospect, that any instruction
or assistance could have been introduced to advantage among them.
And it may be proper here to mention, that government was informed
of our prospect of affording assistance to these Indians, and expressed
entire approbation. The committee also appointed a part of their number to make a visit
to some Delawares, near Mohickon John, a water of the Muskingum
in the state of Ohio, with authority to give them some assistance, and
having since learned by their Report, that a visit has been paid to them
accordingly, to much satisfaction, we have continued the deputation
to give them such further advice and assistance, as their wants may
appear to require in the cultivation of their lands. Notwithstanding the difficulties and discouragements the committee
have had to encounter, they yet feel a lively hope, that by keeping
patiently under the weight of this concern, their labours may finally be
successful. We have examined the Treasurer's accounts and find in his hands a
balance of $1469 59 cents, exclusive of the principal of the Donation
received from our Brethren of Great Britain. Signed on behalf of the Committee.
Philip E. Thomas, Clk. 
Baltimore, 10th Month 16th, 1810. Then adjourned At a meeting of the committee on
Indian concerns 10 mo 19 1810 Present 18 Members The expediency of a visit to the Indians
at Wapakanetta being taken into consideration
a renewed interest was felt in the prosecution
of the concern, and the following friends were
appointed to pursue the views of the committee
as stated in the minute made upon the subject
in the siting of the 2nd month last, to wit Philip 
Dennis, John Ellicott Benjamin Ellicott 
Isaac Tyson , Jonathan Wright , Henry Mills 
 Samuel Jones & Samuel Test 
Then adjourned At a meeting of the committee on Indian
concerns 12 mo 12 1810 present 13 members It appearing that the friends who
stand appointed to visit the Indians at
Wapakanetta have not yet proceeded on
the service, the subject of the contemplated
visit being again brought into view and
weightily considered, it was unitedly con
cluded that the visit be proceeded in
as early in the 2nd month next as practicable
and the sub committee were directed to
write to that portion of our number
who reside west of the mountains and
inform them of the time that the contemp
lated visit is proposed to be made, and
request them to engage a suitable person
to compleat the mill, who will be in readi
ness to engage in the work against the time
the committee is expected to get out
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee on
Indian concerns 5 mo 20 1811 present 8 members Henry Mills on behalf of the committee
appointed to extend assistance to the settle
ment of Delaware Indians near Mohicken
Johns Lake informed that a visit had been
made to them and they furnished with 12
axes 25 Hoes 6 mattocks 4 pair plow Irons 8 sett
of Gears Swingle Tree Irons & Devices for each &
2 log chains, and that a young man had
been employed to remain amongst them
during the present season for the purpose of
making plows &c. for them, and instructing &
assisting them in the cultivation of their lands.
He also informed that the Indians at these
Towns appear industrious and much disposed to
turn their attention towards agriculture, yet it
was apprehended that the efforts of Friends for
their benefit of these Indians would be greatly
frustrated and the good disposition of these people
be perverted by some evil disposed white persons
who had settled near them and who were in the 
practice of furnishing them illegally with spirit
ous liquors. After deliberate consideration it was
unitedly concluded that a deputation from
those of our committee who reside west of the
mountains be appointed to take an opportunity
with the Presiding Judge of the District in which 
these Indians live and lay before him the abuses 
which are found to exist, in order to interest him
to cause the law which has been obtained
from the legislature of Ohio prohibiting the
sale of Spiritous Liquors to Indians to be rigidly
enforced. It was also concluded that the same
friends be requested to make a visit to the
Indians at these Towns, make them acquainted
with the provissions of this law & endeavour
to impress upon them the dreadful effects
of indulging in the use of this baneful article
They were also left at liberty to furnish them
with such additional tools as they may apprehend
to be necessary
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee 10 mo 17 1811
 present 11 Members, Several letters and communications
were recd. from the committee appointed, to
superintend the assistance rendered to
the Indians at Waupaukanetta which
were satisfactory A report was also recd. from the
friends appointed to render assistance
to the settlement of Delawares near
Mohicken Johns Lake The following report to the Yearly
Meeting was agreed on To the Yearly Meeting now Sitting. The Committee appointed on Indian Concerns have agreed to in-
form, that since our report of last year, we have continued our atten-
tion to the object of our appointment. No opening having presented
to renew our efforts in favour of the Indians residing at Dennis's Sta-
tion on the Wabash, we have confined our assistance to the settlement
of Shawaneese, at Wapakonetta, and the Delaware towns near Mo-
hickon-John's Lake. Agreeably to the prospect held up in our last report, a deputation
from our number have made a visit to the settlement at Wapako-
netta, and upon confering with the Chiefs and others, found the manx-
iously desirous to receive assistance from Friends ; and particularly
to be aided in putting up a Grist and Saw Mill at their town. Upon
examining the seat, it was found not to be so eligible as one could
have been desired ; but, as it appeared to be the best in that neighbour-
hood, it was finally concluded to erect a Grist and Saw Mill there.
Workmen have accordingly been engaged, and are now employed in
erecting them, under the personal superintendence of one of our Com-
mittee, by whom we are informed, that it is expected they will both be
completed in the course of the present season. We may also inform,
that the accounts which have reached us from these Indians, represent
them as generally industrious, and disposed to cultivate their lands ;
divers of them having already been cleared and in cultivation, as much
ground as furnishes an abundant sufficiency of grain for the use of 
their own families. And it is hoped that when their Mills shall have
been completed, this disposition will more generally spread amongst
them. Another deputation from our Committee have also made a visit to
the before mentioned settlements of Delawares at Greens-town and
Jerome's-town, near Mohickon-John's Lake. They found these In-
dians industriously disposed, and earnestly desirous of receiving some
assistance from Friends. They were accordingly furnished with such
implements of husbandry as their situation appeared to require, and a 
young man of our Society, of exemplary habits, was procured, who re-
sided several months with them, and assisted them in preparing their
tools, and putting in their crops. Several of them have learned to
plough their lands ; and it is hoped that the assistance already furnish-
ed will be of essential service to them. We may further add, that the late disturbances amongst the Shawa-
neese at Wapakonetta and its vicinity, which so long interrupted our
operations, have nearly subsided. Upon examining the Treasurer's Accounts, we find balance in his
hands of 1287 dollars 53 cents, exclusive of the principal of the do-
nation from our Brethren of Great Britain. The expenditures now
accruing in the improvements at Wapakonetta not having been
drawn for. Signed on behalf of the Committee.

Baltimore, 10 mo. 17th, 1811. Then adjourned to the 28th Inst. when the
Committee again met present 16 members It being expected that the Grist & Saw
Mills which were undertaken to be put up
for the use of the settlement of Indians
at Waupaukanetta will be compleated
with in the course of the present season 
the sub committee were diricted to to write
to Jonathan Wright and request him
to engage on behalf of this committee
a suitable person to take the management
of them until the Indians shall have
become sufficiently instructed to do
it themselves, and to draw upon our
treasurer for such amount as may
be necessary to cover the expences
that may be incured, and also the
amount yet unpaid towards the mills Henry Mills , William Wood &
Horton Howard were appointed to
make another visit to the Delawares
near Mohicken Johns lake and left
at liberty to furnish such further
assistance to them as may be expedient
Then adjourned At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian
concerns held 11 mo 15 1811 present 10 members &
(Quaitawaippai) Captain Lewis , a chief of the
Shawanese nation, at the Mingo Town 
Captain Lewis stated that he had several times 
before visited his Friends & Brothers the Quakers &
held talks with them, and has found upon experience
that what they have heretofore told him, respecting the
benefits he would receive from cultivating the ground
is true. He remarked that he felt a strong desire
to conform to the advice he has received to plant corn
and take care of his Farm & Stock, and has been trying
to conform to it in order to support his family; but
he is in want of tools & farming utensils and cannot
carry on his business without them. In order to effect
what has already been done at his villages, his 
people have been obliged to borrow from Waupaukan
etta, but being soon obliged to return them they have
worked to a great disadvantage. He has himself 4
Horses, but no gears to put on them, and should he
obtain assistance from friends, it will be applied by
him for the general benefit of his village Captain Lewis further stated that there are
about 40 young men at his town who are capable
of labour and that they had cleared and fenced
in a considerable quantity of land which was
now under cultivation, that he had this past
year raised a good crop of wheat & corn and proposed
on his return home to open a road from his village
to the mill now building by friends for the use of
the Indians at Waupaukanetta, He also stated
that his people some time since unanimously 
determined to listen to the advice they had received
to abstain from spirituous liquors and that none had
latterly been introduced amongst them. The committee after taking into consideration
the communication from Captain Lewis con
cluded to return him the following answer
To Captain Lewis Brother
The opportunity we have had of taking
each other by the hand and talking together has
been satisfactory to us, and it is particularly pleasing
to learn that our Red brethren at the Mingo Town,
have had their eyes opened and are now able to see
what is their true interest Brother
We have listened to the application which
is now made to us for some implements of husbandry
to enable you to carry into effect the determination
you have adopted to turn your attention hereafter
to the cultivation of your lands, and we have concluded
to direct our Brother Jonathan Wright who lives near
Miami, to furnish you with 2 ploughs, Gear for 4
Horses, 1 xcut saw, 1 pack plane, 1 fore plane, 1 pair
of plough & groove planes, 1 Grubbing hoe 1 Hackle
1 Spinning wheel, 3 augers, 6 Gimblets 1 brod axe
1 drawing knife, 6 iron wedges 1 stock sack & 1
Handsaw Brother
The information that has reached us
of our brethren at the Mingo Town having totally
abandoned the use of spirituous liquors has been
very pleasing to us, and it is this information that
has determined us to extend the assistance we now
give them
cont. Brothers
We hope you will not suffer any more
of this poison to be brought to your town you have
seen the effect of it & must know its consequences;
Spirituous Liquors not only corrupt the minds of those
who drink it, but it also occasions great poverty &
distress in the families of those men who get drunk
because it destroys their reason and disqualifies them
for work, it has this effect upon the white people
who drink it and it will have the same effect
upon you. Brother
We request our brother will accept
the assurances of our sincere and affectionate
regard: We rejoice that he and us have been per
mitted to have an opportunity of again taking one
another by the hand and of renewing those friendly
sentiments, which we before entertained towards
each other and our desire to the Great Spirit is,
that he will preserve our brother & his family
through the long journey they have before them and
return them safe to their homes. The Secretary was directed to write to Jon.
Wright and request him to procure & forward
to Dayton the implements of husbandry
now promised to Capt Lewis , and draw on
our Treasurer for the amount of Expence
incured
Then adjourned At a meeting of the committee on Indian concerns
1 mo 1812 present members The following letter was rcd. from A committee
of the Meeting for Sufferings at Philad.
Philad. 12 mo 24 1811
Beloved Friends The Meeting for sufferings in London
having lately sent an Epistle to our meeting they therein
request that we will transmit to them such infor
mation of the progress and effect of civilization amongst
the Indian natives as may come under our cognizance
or may arise out of the reports of the several com
mittees engaged in that work: And they further say
that it will be additionally acceptable if the infor
mation include the proceedings of Friends in New York
and Maryland- As they have several times made a
request nearly similar to this, our meeting for suffering
sensible that Friends in England interested in the success
of a cause so congenial with the spirit of christianity
have as brethren a reasonable expectation that we would
freely open to them the state of this business from time to
time, as far as may be material for their knowledge and
satisfaction, have appointed a committee to give attention
to the subject as a part of which we were desired to
write to some friend in Baltimore informing of the
situation in which we are placed, and if Friends
of the Indian committee in Baltimore saw no
material objection, it would be acceptable to receive 
a sketch of such facts and occurences as they
might judge proper for communication- we do
not mean any copies of minutes nor the least allusion
to any expenditure of money sent from England but
merely a brief narrative of such affairs & proceedings
as would enable friends in England to understand the
arduous service Friends on this continent are engaged
in, and in some measure to form correct ideas of
the disposition, habits and general circumstance of that
People we are thy loving friend
Jon Evans 
Philip E. Thomas 
Thomas Wistar which being considered, the following communication
was directed to be forwarded to Friends in Phila. The Yearly Meeting of Friends in Maryland
having been brought under an exercise on acct. of
the neglected situation of the Indian Natives of this
continent appointed a committee in the Year 1795
to open a communication with some of the tribes
bordering on the Western frontier of the United
States, and furnish such relief and assistance
to them as they might be enabled to render The committee proceeded to give considerable
attention to the subject of their appointment but altho'
partial assistance, in tools and implements of husbandry
was from time to time, furnished to several Indian villages
yet no permanent settlement was attempted amongst them
until the Year 1804, at which time a deputation from
the committee, after a full conference with the Chiefs
of the Miamy confederacy, at their request, commenced 
an establishment on the Wabash river, where a number
of Indian families from the neighbouring villages removed,
for the purpose of being instructed in agriculture a
considerable quantity of ground was cleared and put
into cultivation, and most kinds of domestic animals
such as Horses, Cattle, Hogs introduced After several Years attention at this settlement,
finding that their labours became greatly interrupted
and their views misrepresented by an evil disposed
person who at that time resided with the Indians, and had
acquired an extensive influence amongst them, the com
mittee believed it right after addressing the Natives
on the occasion & explaining fully to them the situation
in which they found themselves to withdraw for a time
from that place. Many of the Indians seemed grateful for
the assistance they had received, and although the establish
ment did not succeed to the extent which the committee
had anticipated, yet it is believed that some essential
advantages have resulted to the Indians there- They have
been brought by experience to feel the benefits of an
agricultural life; & by the introduction of Cattle & Hogs
amongst them, to the rearing of which their country is
peculiarly well adapted, their resources to obtain food
have been increased; Many families have also been
provided with comfortable Houses which has stimulated others
to endeavour to obtain them also and their minds have
been generally excited to look to the cultivation of the
earth for their support, and the committee apprehend
that the time is perhaps not very distant when it may
become right to resume their labours at that place Applications having been frequently made
to the committee by the Shawanese nation of Indians
for assistance it was concluded upon withdrawing from
the establishment at the Wabash, to turn their attention
towards them, a grist and saw mill have accordingly 
been erected in their country and implements of husbandry 
furnished to them; and as this nation appear earnestly
disposed to avail themselves of the assistance which is given
them, and manifest a disposition to become industrious
the committee indulge an expectation, that their efforts
here will suceed. These people have now a considerable
quantity of land in cultivation & many of them raise
as much grain as is necessary for the consumption of their
own families-They have also a considerable number of
cattle Hogs &c. The committee have latterly also extended
some aid to two villages of the Delawares upon the
Muskingum river, and have the satisfaction to believe
that an improvement is taking place amongst these In attending to this service they have hitherto
embraced no other objects than those connected with
the cultivation of the soil, and the introduction of
some of the arts of civil life amongst the Indians, yet
while these have been viewed as necessary preliminaries
in the civilization of those people, the committee have
not been unmindful of the importance of School learning
and those considerations which relate to their religious
improvement but have not yet thought it best to attempt
the introduction of Schools amongst them It may not be improper further to remark, that
after a number of years of patient and assiduous labour
the committee are confirmed in the opinion that the work
in which they are engaged will continue to be an arduous
one and that much time and exertion will yet be
neccesary to effect any extensive or permanent change
amongst the Indian Natives. Long established habits are
no where easily eradicated and few nations appear to
adhere more strongly to the customs of their ancestors than
these people, added to this, their ardent attachment to
personal freedom, and their having heretofore been entire strangers 
to any kind of restraint renders them impatient of labour &
in some measure averse to the pursuits of a steady industrious
life Those more immediately under the care of the Yearly
Meeting of Maryland have also less inducements to abandon 
their ancient mode of living than some others
Possessing a vast extent of country which abounds in
wild animals upon which they have been accustomed
to feed, they are under less necessity of resorting to
agriculture, than those tribes which are surrounded by
the settlement of white people, nevertheless upon a 
review of the progress made towards the accomplishment
of the object of their appointment, the committee believe
there is cause of encouragement for Friends to persevere
in this truly laudable and interesting work and that
although they may still have discouragements and
difficulties to encounter, yet they trust the work is pro
gressing and that their labours will ultimately succeed Balto. 1 mo 12th 1812 At a Meeting of the Committee 2 mo 2 1812 present 14 members The sub committee were desired to write
to our members west of the mountains & Request
them to engage a person to compleat the Mills

will admit in the Spring and also to desire them
to forward on to the committee the amount
and items of expence incured, and to engage
a suitable person who will remain at the
settlement to take charge of the Mills when
completed and instruct the Indians in the
management of them, and give them such advice
& assistance in their agriculture as may appear
necessary

J. Ellicott The Committee appointed to prepare a report to
the Yearly Meeting produced the following which
was approved and the Clerk directed to sign it
on behalf of the Committee, to wit To the Yearly Meeting now siting We the committee on Indian concerns
Report that since the last yearly meeting we have received
information, that the Mill which was erected at Waupa
kannetta for the use of the Indians had been so far
compleated as to commence grinding, and gave general
satisfaction to them as it was expected to be of much
assistance In order to promote the views of Friends for the
benefit of those Indians at Waupaukannetta who had
solicited our assistance the committee wrote to such
of their members as reside west of the Allegahney
mountains in the 4th month last, that is had been
concluded to endeavour to procure a suitable man
and his wife to reside at the settlement for the
purpose of taking charge of the Mill and affording
the needful instruction in their agricultural and
domestic concerns, and requested them to procure
such, the committee have however understood, that
owing to the unhappy occurences which about this
time took place in that Country, no persons could be
engaged; and soon afterward the communications
between the white settlements and the Indians becoming
almost intirely cut off, our operations necessarily
have been altogether suspended and the committee
have lately been informed that nearly the whole of the 
Indians at that place have abandoned their settlement
and been removed for safety amongst the white people
as it was believed their lives would be endangered by
remaining at their village The committee may further inform that they
received a visit during the past apring from Quaita
waippay (Captain Lewis ) a principal chief of the Mingo 
town, a village in the negihbourhood of Waupaukanetta;
Captain Lewis' visit was for the purpose of obtaining
some assistance for his Village and as we had received
satisfactory information of the Industry and sober
habits of these Indians, it was concluded to furnish
them some aid, and accordingly an order was given
upon a member of our committee who resides
not very distant from his Village for a few articles
of Husbandry which have been prepared & at his request
placed subject to his order in Dayton, but the whole
of the people of his Town having been also removed
for protection, amongst the white Inhabitants, the
Tools have not been taken possession of by him From information received from those of our
committee who were appointed for the purpose of
aiding the Indians residing on the waters of the
Muskinghum river it appears that they had made
them a visit much to their satisfaction, having
found the Indians industriously engaged in clearing their
lands for the purpose of planting & sowing, but the
villages being remote from the residence of these friends
rendered it inconvenient to them personally to yield the
necessary care, they therefore engaged a suitable person
in the neighbourhood of the Villages to make the in 
 frequent visits, and advise and instruct them where
it might appear necessary. He was also authorized to
furnish what for the purpose of sowing to such of
them as he might find disposed to cultivate it, and
upon the whole there was a good prospect of
their making considerable advances in the arts
of civil life, since this account however the committee
have been informed, that owing to the exasperated state
of the public mind against the Indians throughout that
country, these towns have been destroyed and the Indians
compelled to seek refuge under the government of Ohio
the committee have likewise received information
that the establishment which they heretofore occupied
on the Wabash called Dennis' Station, has also
been destroyed, and their Houses burnt down; as
at this place considerable progress had been made
by the Indians in Building and cultivation and as
many of them had discovrd a disposition for
civilization this event is much regreted Situated as the committee now find the
Indians generally Driven from their habitations
and their Country desolate, they are not of opinion
that in the present state of the public mind, their
labours can be of much avail, but the committee
are willing to hope that by continuing patiently
under the concern, the time may return, when they will
be able to renew their efforts and perhaps more efficiently
than heretofore We have examined the Treasurer acct. and
find a balance in his Hands of $ 1972 53/100 exclusive of 
 $196 68/100 place in the hands of the members of the
committee west of the mountains and the principal

pakannetta who have been heretofore under our care had
returned to their Villages, and had raised a good crop of
corn from which they had sold about 3000 Bushels and that
they have a prospect of a large crop the present season

Ohio, we are likewise informed that the tools and
implements of husbandry which had been prepared for
Captain Lewis , and the Indians at Stoney Creek were
all delivered to them and are now in use, and that
these Indians had also continued firmly attached to the
white People, and such of them as were permited to re
main at home were busily engaged on their farms. He
also states that the Mill which had been nearly complet
ed at Waupaukanetta still remains unfinished on
account of the unsetled state of things in that country We have not received any information from the
