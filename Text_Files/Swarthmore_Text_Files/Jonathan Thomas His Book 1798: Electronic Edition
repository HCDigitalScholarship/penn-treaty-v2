 In the following sheets I propose to give a short account of
 Indian affairs in this settlement (Oneida) for my own amusement
 and the satisfaction of having our proceedings in black and
 white to view at any time. How far I shall be able to set it
 in its true light I cannot tell In the fall of the year 1795 at the Yearly Meeting held
 in Philadelphia for Pennsylvania and New Jersey, The situations of
 the original inhabitant of North America was laid before the
 meeting, friends thinking it best to make a move in the con-
cern for the civilization of the some of this people, A committee
 was appointed to take the matter particularly under their care
 Shortly after their appointment the minutes of the yearly
 meeting (on this concern) with several letters from the sachems
 & chiefs of several Nations, were sent to the quarterly and
 monthly meetings throughout the yearly meeting with advices
 to raise a fund for the use of this concern. From the several
 quarterly and monthly meetings about six thousand pounds
 was raised. In the spring of the year 1796 several young
 men
 men expressed a willingness to reside some time amongst
 the natives (to wit) Jacob Taylor, Enoch Walter , and Henry Simmon 
 with three of the committee namely John Pierce , Joseph Sansom 
 and James Cooper to accompany them and open a settlement
 in some part of the Oneida reservation, (one which lived a
 the Oneidas, Muheconick and a few Tuscororas) Also to visit seve-
ral other Nations and inform them* what the design of Friends
 was in coming forward in this way, the above named friends
 came on horseback except Jacob Taylor who came by wa
-ter to convey some articles for the use of the settlement
 and a few presents for the Indians, they arrived about the
 beginning middle of the 6th Mo. of this year amongst them, after 
see page 21 this book
 viewing the situations of the Oneidas, Muheecosick or Stockbridge and
 Tuscaroras the concluded to settle the young men amongst the
 former, and agreed to assist the Muheconick and Tuscaroras as
 far as the following article specifies: Brothers of the Stockbridge Nation We are very glad to find that through the blessing
 of the great spirit, and your honest industry and frugal
 sobriety you may soon be in a way to live comfortably with
 -out being beholding to any body for help Brothers As you cannot but thankfully acknowledge
 this to be the care with your Nation in general and as you
 know we want to help many of your Indian Brothers a 
 little who stand in much more need than you do; we trust
 you will not think hard of us if we do not do a great deal for
 you at this time; But, Brothers in order to encourage you to be
 still more industrious and saving, and to set a good example to your
 Indian brothers and Neighbors; who are far behind you in point
 of civilization we have agreed to help you a little as follows, -- 1st Brothers, We agree to give you our smith Tools, all complete
 and one of our Friends can instruct you a little in using
 them; and also a share of our implements of husbandry which
 we expect up by our friend Jacob Taylor whom we left behind
 in order to bring them up by water. 2nd Brothers We also are willing to encourage you in 
building 
 building a Grist mill by agreeing to advance three dollars
 to your one of all the money actually to be paid for Materials,
 Mechanical, labour and vitualing the workmen, you finding
 the timber and delivering it on the spot, and doing such other
 parts of the business as you may be capable of without bring
 -ing it into the general charge, of which we have agreed to pay
 three fourths, we also agree that the 100 dollars lent to Captain
 Hendrick by our committee together with 40 Dollars lent to
 John Sergeant by us for the use of the nation, shall be consider
 -ed as a part of this advance, and left in your hands for
 the aforesaid purpose providing always that if the government
 shall at any time pay the expense of said mill agreeable to 
 to an article, which you say is contained in a late treaty,
 then, in that case you are to refund to our committee all
 and every part of the advance made by us towards said mill. And we propose our Friends, Jacob Taylor and Enoch Walker 
 to take the special care and superintendence, of building said
 mill without making any charge on you for their trouble and
 we further propose that when said mill is erected, that
 you call a general council, and choose a suitable man a
 -mongst yourselves to take the care of this mill, and to grind
 all of your grain and to keep the mill in order and that
 you agree upon some certain and fixed portions for this man to
 have out of every grist that shall be ground, sufficient to 
 to pay him well for his time and trouble, and to enable
 him to keep the mill in good order repair which he ought to do at
 his own expense out of his profits, which you allow him, and
 further we propose that you admit your brothers the Tuscaroras
 to enjoy part of the advantages of this mill. 3rd Brothers We also propose to encourage you in keeping
 up a school for the education of your children by agreeing to
 pay part of the salary to your former master John Quinney 
 if he will agree again to teach; we are willing to pay 25 dollars
 a Quarter for one year at least, if you will agree to make up as
 much more as will to encourage him to keep steadily. Our Friends
 who stay amongst you will pay the money punctually when a 
 a certificate is produced to them signed by two of your Chiefs
 certifying that the school has been kept steadily for the length
 of time above mentioned for payment, the Tuscaroras being
 admitted to partake equally of the Advantages of this school.— Brothers We further propose for your encouragement in
 Agriculture, Industry etc. that for the term of two years from the
 third month next, we will give the following premiums to
 any individual Indian of the Stockbridge or Tuscarora Nation
 living on this reservation upon the conditions hereinafter
 mentioned: 1st For every 50 bushels of wheat raised in one
 year within said term by any one farmer of either of these
 two nations, on his own land nor worked by any white people the sum 
 of two dollars, 2nd For every 100 bushels of Indian
 corn raised in like manner; aforesaid the sum of two dollars

agreement 
 Agreement was come to, proposed on the 25th and agreed
 on the 30th of the 6 Mo 1796 Brothers of the Oneida Nation First, You now know that we are sent to you by your, Old friends
 the people called Quakers, of Pennsylvania and parts adjacent, not
 merely to make you presents, which will soon be spent leaving
 you poor and needy, but to shew you how the white people
 manage to raise a great deal of food and clothing off, of
 a little land; that you may become able to support your
-selves and your children comfortably, without being beholding to 
 to any body, and have something to spare for the old and infirm
 as well as to lay by against times of scarcity –- Brothers
 Remember that we have left all that was near and dear
 to us at home, not to get your Lands from you, or any thing
 that you have is yours but to visit you in love and to stay with
 you, if happily we may put you in a way, to enjoy the manifold
 blessings of all bountiful Creator; now we have seen and reflected
 upon your situation and consulted one another for your the future
 prosperity of your whole Nation and three Tribes you have 
kindly 
 kindly permitted to settle on your lands and we have put our
 conclusions in writing, that it may be know what we are willing to
 undertake for you, and what we desire you to do towards it yourselves
 for we mean to set before you a clear Example if you will agree
 to follow it, Now Brothers We trust that we possess your
 confidence unmixed with any Jealousies or fears and we request you
 to listen Patiently and attentively, to what we are going to propose to
 you for your own good and if any part of it displeases you tell
 us so and we will consider it; Brothers, Three of our friends
 intend to stay with you for these purposes namely Jacob Taylor 
 Henry Simmons and Enoch Walker ; but they are not bound
 to remain by anything but good will; neither are they obliged 
 obliged to work more than they think necessary nor to be alto
-gether among you as they are to go sometimes to Tuscarora Stock
-bridge and Brothertown, we earnestly desire that none of you may
 discourage them by swearing, idleness, drunkenness or misbehavior;
 for these things are very disagreeable to us, as you know they are
 to the good spirit; Brothers, you know we must have some
 land to work upon and we should like to be begin upon that part
 of the common that lies west of the path from Skanandoahs
 to Stockbridge, south of the road to onondago; East of the bounda
-ry of the old fort and north of skanandoah creek excepting any
 part thereof now occupied by your families

 Brothers 
 Brothers; if we think there is encouragement to under
-take more another year, we shall ask you for it seasonably,
 and agree together where it shall be Brothers, you know it is hardly practicable for all to learn
 together; we will begin with a few, who must stick to the
 work the rest will see how the get forward. and will be
 ready to take their turn, when it comes round we want
 to engage six or eight sober young Men as Apprentices
 till next spring; Brothers; we suppose you will be wis
-hing that we should feed our Horses, Cattle, &c., upon the com
-mon and that you will allow us some Grass lots, to provide
 hay for them in the winter. to cut firewood railing and timber for 
 for building in your woods use your sawmill and smith shop
 when we have occasion for them and sometimes work your
 Horses and oxen, when you are not using them Brothers; you will understand that our friends are to live plen
-tifully, as their own people do at home, and their live stock is to
 be kept upon the produce of their labour, in the first place
 one eighth part of the remainder is to be reserved for the relief
 of your old and infirm People, the rest to be divided among the
 young Indian Apprentices, that they may enjoy the fruit of
 their labour and have something to begin with for themselves when
 other apprentices are taken in their stead provided they
 behave well: but in the case of continued idleness drunkenness 
 drunkenness, swearing or misbehavior in any of them, our
 friends must not keep bad company, and we request you to appoint
 three of your Chiefs to unite with our three friends as Judges
 that, if four of them agree the person offending may be just
-ly discharged—, Now Brothers, Our stay amongst you
 will depend upon several circumstances, and particularly
 the encouragement we may have to hope that your Nation
 will in time become sober industrious and frugal, laying up
 something for yourselves against sickness and Old age. When
-ever we leave you the improvements we make on your
 lands will belong to you: but the cattle and other things
 we bring with us we shall consider as our own The Indians replied on the 30th of the 6 Mo in substance
 as follows, Brothers, we find no difficulty in accepting
 your proposals as to anything but the place you choose
 many of our people are against
 parting with any of the commons, because we have hardly
 pasture enough for our cattle now, and if we lesson it they will
 be famished and break down the fences and get at the corn, beside
 which we are afraid our young men will disturb you sometimes
 there when they get in liquor, Brothers we think it
 right to propose another place to you which we think
 may suit you better, we will go shew it to you Upon this the spot was viewed, and mutually agreed on
 to as follows, begining at the gut south, south east of
 Anthony Shononleyo house. and running nearly south by a tree
 marked to a tree marked as far as Shanandoah Creek extend
ing eastward into the woods without limitation. And Anthony
 Shononleyo being willing to lease his house it was engaged
 for the use of the settlement. It was also agreed that they firs[t]
 should have liberty to enclose what they might want
 of the flats for hay or pasture. (agreeable to the 8th paragraph)
 but the Indians did not choose to engage their oxen, except
 their young ones to be broke; or their horses, because
 they were not good for anything to work, and John Skanan
-doah, Anthony Shononleyo , and Nicholas Shagnokorongo , were 
 were appointed as Judges under the 9th paragraph In confirmation of all which preceding agreements we
 have Hereunto interchangeably set our hands the 6th
 day of the 7 Mo 1796 Through inattention the following letter was omited in
 its proper place. which I think justly claims room in this
 account it was sent previous to friends settling amongst them A circulatory letter from the committee of the Indian
 institution to the six Nations of Indians
To our Indians Brethren of the six Nations
 Brothers; We rejoice that you are now at peace
 and we pray to the good spirit that he may continue to preserve 
 you from the miseries of war, We have always had your
 welfare at heart, ever since our Grandfather, Onas * cam[e]
 into this country; and the present time appears to us to be a
 favorable one, again, to manifest our unalterable friendship
 for you We cannot forget the harmony that subsisted be
-tween our forefathers and the Indians during the first se
-ttlement of this country Brothers; we have heard some of your chief men say that
 they believed the Good spirit designs that you should not
 live much longer by hunting alone. The game is grown
 scarce yet although your lands are much less than they
 once were, they are with a small degree of Industry
 *Onas implies William Penn
 abundantly sufficient to supply all your wants, Brothers; Our hearts are open to you. we are desirous
 to help you to make the best use of your lands. We are
 united in this matter and as we now enjoy peace and
 tranquility, we are now ready to part with some of our
 substance to make you more happy. Now we desire to
 ask you a few questions we hope you will answer us candidly Brothers, Are you willing to be instructed in cultivating
 your land and in the method which the white people take
 to live plentifully Brothers, do you desire to learn some of our useful trades 
 trades, such as, blacksmith, Millwrights Wheelwrights and Carpenter 
 that you may build houses and Mills and do other necessary
 things to make your lives more comfortable, Brothers, Would it be agreeable to you that your childre[n]
 should be taught to read and write and such other things as we
 teach our children which is intended to render peaceful and happy Brothers, We cannot doubt from the speeches of your wise
 men at different times that these considerations are become
 very necessary for you to attend to and we wish you would open
 your heart, do not hide your thoughts from us, we
 desire none of your lands nor any thing that you have
 but only to do you and your children good think well
 of what we now propose to you, and send us an answer
 as soon as you can Brothers, We desire you would seriously reflect upon they
 many difficulties you are under the hunger, fatigue and
 cold you are subjected to in your present mode of living
 and compare it with the comfortable manner in which you
 may live under the blessing of the Good spirit: by rais
-ing grain cattle and other necessaries on your land, and
 then we hope that your good understanding will incline you to think
 as we do that your pursuing this mode of life in
 which we are ready to assist you will be of lasting
 advantage 
 advantage to you and your wives and children for generations

 men to attend too which will be treated of and some observa[tions]
 made as they came in course: after some notice is taken
 about the house they rented It was agreed that the young men should live in
 the house they rented as long as was thought needful
 for them or others to continue here for the considera

 done to the house, all which they fulfilled, and cleared *
