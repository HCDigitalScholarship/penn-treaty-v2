selves & going several miles out of our way rea
-ched about 2 oClock & dine afterwards 
rode 8 miles to Daniel Herboin's where
we are now laid by for the night. our re-
flections were excited on passing the
conochocheage Valley a Valley perhaps in
-ferior to none in the Luxuriance of the 
Soil but the comparison in the tillage
with the Valley we passed yesterday is 
as much in favour of the former -- as there
is difference between that cultivated 
by neat Dutch Farmers & that by 
negro Drivers the tints of Distress &
Slavery being generally observable
in our rout this Day. our landlord has 
a Spring Issueing from under his house

where we found plenty of the
necessaries of Life. the Country
here is very good. with excellent
Bottom & upland the Prairies we
have passed are mostly rich but there
is so little timber in many parts that
they can hardly be enclosed with Fences so that if the country is ever settled
they must be ditched 29th we staid until near noon when
we set out & Rode about 12 Miles to

Intend staying here until we can ac-
-comodate ourselves with a Man to
go with us & provide ourselves with
Grain for our Horses & provisions for our

an Excellent Quality with a very Large 
growth of Timber interspersed with abun

Stanton the Growth of Timber is of Rich
kind & not very useful except the Walnut we have put up at a French Man's
Called Felix we had letters from
Dayton to Judge Gerards who was
kind and attentive in procuring
a suitable man to go with us, there
was a young man from Virginia at
this place of the name of Lowell [?] [delete: Crawford]

some of his own freely without So-

begged to be excused alledging that
both himself & his Horse were too weak
-ly so we admitted his excuse &
discharged him. Court began here
to day & it rained so much that 
we concluded the waters would be
impassable & meeting with a Man of 
the name of thatcher who agreed
to go with us we sent our Horse
by him about 16 miles to his Feed House
He living on our road at the First Crossing of Loramie & to be
ready to advance with us at any
time when we should come forward
seeing but little prospect of getting
forward & our inn much crowded

West Branch Monthly Meeting & consists of about
30 Families Still water Meeting being
about 6 miles lower down the River 5th Still rainy & no prospect of
of Proceeding David Graves went
over the River to Still Water Meeting
& tho' I wished to go with him yet as
the River could not be crossed
without swimming I failed
& went about a mile to a black-
-smiths to get my Horse shod 6 Still raining we stay here
& the waters so high that we can
-not go forward -- 7th --weather Clear but the
water so high we cannot move 8th. being First Day we went to
meeting with the Family the Meeting
House so small that it will not hold
above one half of the members But were informed that they propose
dividing the Meeting & Building 2 new
houses this summer one on each side 
of the River having often met with
Difficulty in crossing still water -- 2nd Day morning Benjamin Iddings
proposed setting out with us having
victuals provided we set out early
& Rode to Thatcher's 18 miles Crossed
Loramies Creek & a large Branch of
the great Miami riding thro it being
about the saddle skirts. after Staying
sometime we set out in company with
thatcher & rode to Flins swimming
our Horses across the second Crossing
of Loramies Creek where we put up
for the Night & slept on the Floors
The land this Day mostly good tho'
much of it is too flat to settle on
before we reached thatchers we passed
several miles thro' the woods where the 
the trees were lined with Pigeons nests [?]
some times 20 or thirty in one tree 10th. we set out early & Rode to Murrays
at the first crossing of the St. Mary's
it being a branch of that River we
rode thro without much difficulty
after feeding our Horses at Murrays
& getting a rough repast /I having
lost our own provisions bag & all on 
the Road, we proceed to Stephen Youngs
18 Miles to the 2nd. Crossings of the St. Marys
where we lodged early next morning
we set out Swimming our Horses
across the River which being very
full was run out into the Bottoms
so that we had to ride a good way
thro the water, riding on it began
to rain so that that we had no
Choice but to ride 40 miles thro
a very swampy Country. almost an
entire level & one swamp so dark that
we got thro with difficulty & alarms in
passing which Elisha Tyson lost his 
hat which his Horse trode in the 
mud --- not one House in the whole distance
we arrived at Fort wayne in the
evening wet & tired & put up at 
a French Tavern after we arrived
John Johnston Indian Factor came
& invited two of us to his house Elisha 
went with him & the rest of staid at 
the Tavern 11th we all went to Johnstons where
we staid some time & then went to the
Fort & dined with Captain Heald
who with the other officers were very
kind & attentive we spent the evening
in consulting about the execution of 
our Mission & concluded to invite the
Indians to come to the Fort for consulta-
-tion & after night had a Conference 
with some of the Potowatomy Indians
Winnemak a Chief informed us
that he had been with the president
who had Promised him that he would
send some tools & young men to teach 
them to Farm but had not done there-
-fore he was deceived that he had set his mind upon it & was much 
disappointed & we found it very difficult
to remove he prejudices we stated that
William Kirk had come to their country
last spring with an intention of assit-
ing them but that the Potowatomies
and Miamies had refused to receive him
& that he had to return back to the 
Shawenesse but he said that he had 
received no account of his being here
& so had not refused him & throught
that he can been neglected. the country around Fort wayne is not
of the First Quality [deleted: yet] but on the
other side of the River the land is
good the situation of the Fort is
pleasant & the prospect pretty
good considering the flatness of the
Country Elisha & myself lodged 
at Johnstons & the others at the 
Tavern [deleted paragraph: We had conversation with Winnemak
a Chief of the Potowatomy Nation
residing on the Peconoe River he told 
us that the President of the united States
had promised him that he would give
him assistance in the Cultivation
of his lands & that he had disappointed 
him in not sending the assistance
promised] We staid at Fort Wayne until First day
morning the 15th when David Grave & my-
-self set out for Dennis's Station Elisha
Tyson having been taken with the Rheu-
-matism was bled and Blistered & not
in a situation to ride on acct of the 
soreness of his Blister tho' the pain 
was removed we had concluded
to call the Indians together in 9 
Days at Fort Wayne & had sent
an Indian to the Five Medals town
to give Information & John
Flin Interpreter for John Johnston was to accompany us
to Dennis Station & Massasinneway
but after Crossing the River to William
Wallis's he could not Find his
Horse so we proceeded on & he was 
to overtake us if could get
his Horse, but we arrived there
alone & John Flin came there
in the evening & lodged with us
at Shaw Griffiths 16 David's Horse having failed 
we received acct that the 
Massasinians were drunk & killing 
one another we let John go with
-out us. Elisha & Benjamin Iddings 
arrived in Company with William
Wells about 3 OClock, Elisha was
very much overcome with the Jour-
-ney 17th - We Walked to the upper Village
this morning visited the White loon The Principal Chief and some others &
had some conversation with them &
returned in the afternoon we went down
the River about half a mile below 
Dennis's Station & visited the Eel River
Indians The Indians at both these 
Villages live in tolerable log houses
Which were generally built by Wells
out of their annuities the amt of
the Whole Population of these Villages
with Dennis's Station being about 300
Tomorrow we have appointed to see the
Indians together-- 18th we heard this morning that several 
of the Indians of the Lower Village were
drinking which has a disagreeable feeling
to us but hope they will not Interrupt us
in Council to day -- abut 12 OClock we
met with the Indians of the upper and Lower
Villages & also those at Dennis's Station to
whom we read the address (that was to have
been taken out by John Shaw & Griffith & found
by us at Red Stone it having been to late in get-
-ting out) William Welles being Interpreter Some observations were also communicated
by Elisha Tyson & David Grave to all which
they gave their assent as is customary
after Which the White loon made a Short Speech
acknowledging the propriety of what had
been said & observed that as they expected to
attend the Council at Fort Wayne where 
a more pointed reply would be necessary
he thought it superfluous to say much
at that time the Indians generally made
a pretty good appearance & some had on
very costly dresses. we returned to our young
mens Habitation & Dined upon Beef killed
the Evening before by the Indians it was 
said partly on our account they manifested
respect for us & partly good decorum at the
time of our counselling together We observe few or any of the young men
at labour & it appears doubtful whether
the present generation of young men will
apply themselves to Labour prejudice &
their habits of ease & Indulgence being
to deeply Rooted in their minds Shaw & Griffith were preparing Ground for
Planting Corn the weather had been so wet
for sometime back that the Ground could not
be plowed to advantage. the land Cleared
at these Villages is about 100 Acres they have
about 120 Horse kind & about 50 Horned
Cattle & a good many Hogs the want of
mas last Winter proved fatal to abundance 
of Swine I do not find that Friends have
any Hogs at the Station the land here
as well for 200 Miles down this River is
Excellent & would admit of settlements suf-
-ficient for all the Indians on this side the 
Missisippi & is Navigable up the little River for Boats about
20 Miles above this which is connected by 
a portage of about 8 miles with the St. Mary
a branch of the Miami of the Lake
the main Stream navigable many miles Higher
We viewed the Mill Seat at Dennis
Station on the River which we pronounced
a good one also Dennis's Creek a Large
Branch but pronounced in favour of 
the River Mill the Branch failing 
in the Summer the Weather has been fine for 2 Days past but
this Evening has a threatning aspect so that it
looks quite likely that we must either be detained
here or ride in the Rain tomorrow as usual
the young men have been handing out the 
corn to such as were in want but some of the
Indians having exprest their dissatisfaction
we directed them to give all the Corn they had
to the Indians to be divided by them as they
saw meet & a thought suggested itself to us
that it would be as well for whoever should
be stationed here to spend the chief of their 
time in assisting & Instructing the Indians
Instead of Raising Corn to be given away In the Evening the Chiefs of the Villages
the White Loon of the upper Village from 
Massisiniway & Charley Chief of the Eel 
River Indians at the lower Village & some 
of their Principal Indians attended
& we delivered them a pipe after having taken
taken a fraternal smoke & had some
Friendly Conversation on the subject 
of our Mission Capt Welles has been
our Interpreter We were busy this Morning in making
an early Start in order to reach the Turtle
town on our way to Fort Wayne but rain
coming on & it being only a path thro
thick bushes in places we concluded
to lie by until Morning. in the Evening
it came on a Gust with Thunder & heavy
rain 20th - upon Consultation this Morning
we concluded it would be very difficult
for us to get to Turtle Town on acct
of the Waters being high so sent
John Flin. J. Johnstons interpreter
to give the Little Turtle notice of
Time of our meeting & invite him &
we proceeded to Fort Wayne we ar-
rived at W. Wells's about 3 oClock
Benjamin Iddings & myself staid
at Wells's & Elisha went over to the 
Fort to Johnstons David Grave's Mare being sick staid at
Dennis's Station intending to come on
first day to the Fort in Company with
John Shaw 21st - Breakfasted this morning with Wells
walked about & Viewed the Plantion which
is a very Good one it & the neighbour-
-hood has been formerly the Great
Village of the Miami Indians the
Elavation of the Corn Hills is quite
Visible also the Indian Graves they have
been buried single in the same manner
that we bury & there is some graves
near Wells's House of Indians that have
been recently buried over one of their
Chiefs stands a pole with a white flag
opposite Wells plantion over the River
St. Joseph we were shewn the Ground
where Genral Harmer was defeated
& where many of his men fell in
Crossing the River it was in a large
Priarie which would make a beautiful
Plantion. being Clear land for a great Extent
I suppose at least one thousand acres
Wells's Plantation lies in the fork of
the Mary & Joseph Rivers which
come together before they arrive at the
Fort the stream then takes the name 
of the Miami of the lakes & Runs about
North east the Joseph runs about 
N.W. & the Mary about South West --
there is plenty of fish in the River of the
Cat Bass & Perch & Pickerel & Sheeps head
&c -- we were Examining some of the goods
in Johnstons Store they are many of 
them of the most Indifferent in Quality 
Rifles very Indifferent in Quallitty as is
the hoes without. Steel -- traps by the 
Hundred not worth Six pence per 
piece in Short it appears that if
more attention is not paid to the
Selection of Goods for the Indian
department, our Credit in that
quarter will be done & the Indians
will endeavor to trade with the British this [deletion] we apprehend Judges think
that ten or Fifteen Thousand Dollars
might be saved annually if care
was taken so as to send nothing here
but what was of good quality. &
otherwise suitable for this market 22nd this morning being first day there
there is a smart frost which will be 
pretty hard upon the Gardens & tender
Vegetables the Fruit doubtless will
Suffer -- we went over to W. Wells's to
dine in Company with J. Johnston &
the Officers of the Garrison & the Doctor
where we had a Decent Dinner &
very good decorum the officers & Doctor
with Johnston are all young Men
& appear to be of sober deportment not
one of them [delete: but] given to Intemperance
in short we have been much pleased 
& disappointed to find such Characters
in the Military professions Several of the Indians made their appear-
-ance & one of they call Wapakee called
by the french Maupauk the most Gigantic
Savage looking Indian that we have 
yet seen he is of the Potowatomy &
Sioux Nation mixed he was the chief
who took the 40 Osages prisiners which
the United States lately redeemed at
a very great expense the Osages
have lately killed ten of Sioux &
five of the Delaware & he is treath-
-ing vengance against them. he has his
men he says ready & can stay but 
a short time with us but must meet
them to go against the Osages & it is
thought that it will not be possible
to turn him from his purpose we
dread his company in Council as he
does not appear to have any more
Idea of Civilization than the 
Bears in the Woods he puts
me in mind of some of the Antient Giants perhaps Hercules him-
-self may be pretty well Identified
in his Person & War club he has
but one hand & yet they say there 
is not one Indian in the Country
that the Indians fear so much as 
they do this man -- the five Medals
& White Loon are here. the little Turtle has
the Gout or Rheumatism & is hardly
expected here the prospect is avery 
dull one as we are informed that the
Turtle & five medals are our ene-
-mies & will oppose us. The two Chiefs
at the Wabash, the White Loon for the 
Masseseneway Indians , & Charley for the
Eel River Indians, I believe are 
both Friendly & if it was not for the
undue influence that some bad Cha-
racters have over them & the love of
Whiskey they might in time be brought
into some degree of Civilization 23. This being the day we had appointed
for to hold a Council with the Indians
& many of them were Collected over the river
we were engaged in preparing such
communications to them as we thought
advisible but to our great Mortification
we were informed that the son of the
Five medals had returned from Stanton
where he had been with several men
& Horses to purchase whiskey with a 
Large quantity & that the Indians here
collected had got to drinking it &
were many of them drunk so that the
prospect looks gloomy & that all our
toil will be of no avail 24 The contractor showed us this morn-
-ing that in the month of April last
there was delivered by order of the
Indian agent 1117 Rations of Whiskey
or about 35 Gallons The Contractor
informed us that he offered to furnish
William kirk when in Friends employ
[delete] Flour at $6 per [Cut?] The Indians are still drunk & little
prospect of doing any business with
them about nine o Clock the Indians that
had come in came together except Wapa-
-kee who was too drunk the five Medals was so
much intoxicated with divers others,
that we concluded it would not do
to pretend to treat with them & but
just to come together & inform them
that we were sorry that they had been
drinking so much as to be unfit to talk
with at Present but would meet
them tomorrow morning when if they
were still drunk we would go away
without having any public talk with
them -- The five Medals made reply
that we might speak, as the Potowa-
-tomies were the only people that
were drunk & that they were sober
enough to listen to what we had to say but did not wish to answer
& that they could go home tomorrow & did
not care whether they heard what we have 
to say or not. & told Elisha that he
was no Great Chief & therefore did
wrong to tell the Indians that we
would not treat with them if they were drunk
tomorrow when after a little more talk
we separated to meet again tomorrow
-- morning-- 25th the morning pleasant & the sun
Shining which has not been a very
common thing [delete] here lately we have
had 2 very severe frosts within these few day
past which has killed many things
even the Potatoes are killed to the very
ground the Beans &c killed fairly we wish
to set out as we begin to fear the flies
The Indians assembled this morning
[delete] there was but few of the Chiefs
present We read the address of the Committee to
them. also the Turtles & five Medals speeches
upon the subject of Civilization after wards
was readd an address of our own with
the Turtles speech upon spirituous Liquors
they were mostly interpreted into the
Miami & Potowatomy Languages --
by William Wells for the Miami & John
Flinn for the Potowatomy after which
we went to dinner with Captain
Heald & left the Indians in Council
amongst themselves in order to pre-
-pare an answer to our addresses --
about 2 OClock they sent us word
that they were in readiness to Commun-
-icate to us their minds. we attended
& five Medals after making 
some observations replied to 
Elisha Tysons observation respecting
the proffered aid of Government
& said that there was but few of the Chiefs present that they were engaged
in Business of more importance at this
time William Kirk was here last year
that it was the same case with them
this spring -- & that he did not think us authorized
to Question him upon that subject after he had done the White Loon one 
of the Chiefs residing at Dennis's Station
made some observations respecting our
young men residing amongst them
& said he thought that by Working with
the Indians in their own Fields they
would render them more essential
service & also animadverted upon
the Indian Corn that was to be distri-
-buted among the Indians this spring
at the Station thinking it was a little
extraordinary that after being a great
deal of Corn last fall that there
should be so little this spring when
it was offered for a division the
greater part was taken by Shaw some
less to Wells & some given to the Indians
so that there was only about 50 Bushls-- 26th. We had intended to set out this morning
but there appeared to be a good deal
of Writing to do relative to our Mission
& John Johnston also wished to send some-
-thing of the Writing kind with us which was not
fully prepared -- in the course of the
Day we had a good deal of conversa-
-tion with Wells we were very plain
with him, which he took in good
part & endeavoured to explain or ex-
-cuse. we plainly saw the Difficulty
of his situation & were nearly ready 
to conclude that he was determined 
to act uprightly. we think if he
was Faithful agreeably to his ability
he would still be of use in his
Station. We also had a good deal
of conversation with the White
Loon respecting Whiskey. he seemed
very sensible of the bad consequences
attend[delete: ed]ant upon drinking & made
some very good observations upon the subject comparing it to the throwing
firebrands among the Family & made 
the Women run to hunt shelter some-
-where else but seemed very doubtful
of having firmness enough to resist
the temptation -- 27th. Rode to Fort Wayne through a
Steady days rain & very deep Roads & ar-
-rived at the St. Mary's at Stephen 
Youngs about sun setting & Crossed 
over in a Canoe swimming our
Horses. we let our Horses run loose in
as fine grass as is common to see. it
was spear grass & would have mowed
a good Swarth. here is a proof of In-
-dian Industry. William Kirk last
Spring Built a House and Cleared a Corn field
for this old Indian the field is en-
-tirely neglected tho the land is
Excellent a part is grown up with
spear or Blue Grass so that it won't
mow 28th. we Set out again this Morning
& rode as yesterday thro the rain about
18 miles to Charley Murrays we have 
been very wet these two days & fell a
good deal through feel about our Health
but we have a Floor to lie on with 
a good fire at our feet. Murray has
an Indian Woman for a Wife we eat as
nice Butter & born Bread of her make
as need be wished for. this is the second
crossing of the St. Mary where there has 
been a Garrison the land is good & the
united states have a reserve of about

have a very small Canoe to Ride 
in. after their departure we got our Horses
in readiness & an Indian Squaw as pilot

dangerous a venture so we concluded
