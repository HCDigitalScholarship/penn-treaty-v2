 Some notes kept of a journey from Bradford, the place of our late re-
sidence, to Tunecessah on the Alle-
geny River in York State In the fall of 1804 my dear Hus
band & myself informed fnd s of Bradford
 Moly Meeting, of a concern that had for some
 time attended our Minds, of offering
 ourselves to go and reside some time
 among the Indian Natives near the
 Allegeny River, to endeavor to instruct
 them in Agriculture, Spinning, Dairy,
 &c, and having obtained the Unity and 
 Sympathy of our fnd s at home, and also
 the concurrence of the Yearly Meetings
 Committee on Indian Affairs, Hannah
 Jackson likewise having a minute
 from Newgarden Monthly Meeting, and
 the concurrence of the Committee to
 accompany us. 1805
5 one 20 and 2nd of the Week After a time of comfortable quiet
 wherein we were favoured to feel the
 overshadowing of divine regard to
 be near, a considerable number of our near relations
 and fnd s being present, we took leave of
 them in the feeling embraces of endearing
 love, Father Coope & Brother Ezra bearing
 us company to M. Embrees , there we
 took an Affectionate farewell of dear
 James and his Wife, and we parted with
 Father, a close trial, tears flowed in an
 abundance under a feeling sympathy for
 him, & ardent desires were raised in my
 heart, that he might be enriched with
 that Peace, now in his lonesome and
 advanced Stage of Life, which is the
 precious enjoyment of all the sincere
 hearted. Brother continuing with us
 to Wm. Trueman ’s 11 miles, my husband
 and Brother lodged in the Waggon, Cousin
 and myself were more comfortably ac
commodated with a good Bed, I soon
 fell asleep, but on wakeing about 3 the
 recollection of the parting season so forc-
ably revived, that Tears flowed from
 my Eyes, & sleep departed. Thou Oh my
 God has at Seasons been pleased in thy
 unmerited goodness to make bare thy
 Arm, and in times of trial afford sweet
 consolation as patience was abode in,
 under an humbling sense thereof may
 I a little interceede for the renewed con-
tinuence of thy love.
 21st 3day A fine morning, after a smart
 shower, takeing breakfast, we parted
 with our Brother, and set off at 6, we
 went to the Rising Sun Tavern 11m were
 we fed our horses, and took some re-
freshment ourselves in the Waggon, then
 pursueing our Journey to Wm Brinton ’s
 8m , but neither he nor his Wife being at
 home we proposed going on, but the
 Grand Mother, who was there on a visit, &
 daughter insisted on our going in, an
 excellent dish of Coffee was soon pre-
pared which was very grateful, we
 then proceeded on & got to our Bro-
ther Griffith John 's 4m about 4 OClock
 where we lodged, Wm Embree met us here
 agreeably to appointment and went
 with us through the Journey, he put
 his Horse to the Waggon which with
 our two made three in number,
 23 miles to day 22nd 4th day breakfasted and set off
 half past 5, Brother and Sister bore us
 company to Lancaster, we stoped at
 James Gibbon ’s door and bid farewell,
 at Lancaster we fed our Horses and got
 some necessaries for our Journey, then
 set off, Brother going a piece to put us
 in the right Road, 9 miles from Lancaster
 we crossed little Canestoga, we proceded
 along being entire strangers, the Roads
 exceedingly bad and cut in holes with
 heavy loaded Waggons, and very muddy,
 tho the Country was beautiful, fine grain
 and clover, crossed by Chickisalango
 a large stream 9 miles from Lancaster, got
 some refreshment for ourselves and horses
 at Heller's Tavern, then proceeded on our
 Journey to Elisabeth Town 9 miles, where
 we arrived a while before sunset, the
 Roads still bad, the land good, tho more
 hilly than nearer Lancaster. My atten-
tion has been so taken up with viewing
 the Roads and Country that I have had
 but little serious reflection, yet have
 not felt much unpleasant sensations, nor
 enjoyed so large a Portion of that precious
 consolation which my soul often de-
sires, O that I may abide in the patience
 with mine Eye single to him whose Fa-
 therly protection is as a Wall around
 about those who are sincerely devoted
 to serve him, where ever their lot
 may be cast. we lodged at the Bear Tavern 25 miles. 23 rd . 5 th day A fine Morning, rose early,
 set out about 4, crossed Conowago moun
tain and creek, the Hills exceedingly Rocky, the
 Roads rather better near Middletown, some of
 the land good, we forded Sweetaraw Creek
 a large wide water and so deep as to run
 into the Waggon Bed, we got to Middletown
 in Dauphin County to Breakfast 8 miles
 here I sent a few lines home by a fnd from
 Philadelphia. 9 OClock proceeded on our
 Journey, through a beautiful Valley and
 very fertile Country for several Miles,
 about 11 we got in sight of the River, the
 Country on the right was soon after ob-
structed by a large Ridge of Limestone
 Hills, the Rocks in places were 30 or 40 feet
 high, the Ridge continued till we came near on the
 bank of the River. got in sight of Harrisburg
 about 1 OClock, 9 miles, we stoped under the
 Shade of a Tree, bought grass for the Horses,
 and took some refreshment in the Waggon.
 ½ past 2 proceeded on, we crossed a small
 Creek called Paxtang over an Elegant
 Stone Bridge, then passed through Haris-
burgh a considerable Town, and beautifully
 Situated, having a fine prospect of the
 River, we then travelled 7 miles close on the
 Bank of Sd River, with A considerable distance of a
 fine Cultivated Country on the Right, the
 River flowing Close on the left, and a great
 many Locosts Trees in full bloom on each
 hand made the prospect truly delightful,
 but after a calm sometimes comes a storm,
 we now crossed Fishing Creek a large
 stream, and then for three Miles it was a-
stonishing to behold the romantic appear-
ance, one rough stony Cartway near
 the River and great Rocks from 400
 to 600 feet high hanging, as it were,
 over our heads, we then crossed Stony
 Creek and put up at Elders Tavern 10 m 
 we are now at the foot of the blue Moun-
tain having gone round it by the side
 of Susquehanna. it is computed to be
 600 feet high, and I could scarcely keep
 my Eyes of it, the prospect was so
 Wonderful 27 miles 24 th 6th day Started this Morning about 4,
 had a very good road tho a little hilly
 with some spots of Cultivated land for about
 2 miles, then Crossed Clarks Creek and
 prepared to ascend Peters Mountain,
 the road pretty good, we were 1¼ hour go-
ing over it, called two Miles, it was
 remarkable to see several lively springs
 near its summit. Shortly after we left
 this Mountain we crossed Powells Creek
 a large stream, and had an excellent
 Road to Hallifax a small Town, 10 miles,
 here we got Breakfast and are in sight of the River. Some parts of the
 last stage Cultivated, the grain chiefly Rye,
 some fields of a changable Red with some
 Clover. the Soil gravelly and of a Red-
ist colour. Started at 9, crossed Armstrong
 Creek, passed along a very rough road,
 with some rain, close on the River, at the
 foot of Barry's Mountain, then crossed Wi-
kinisky Creek a stream as large as Brandywine,
 we now began to get among the Pines,
 a few places, here and there Cultivated,
 the Soil not very productive, poor look-
ing Houses, Stoped by the side of the Road
 and refreshed ourselves out of the Waggon 10m.
 Started at 2 had 3 miles of a good Road to
 Mahantango Mountain, ½ an hour took us
 over, we then crossed Mahantango Creek
 over a high Frame Bridge, this is a longer
 stream, we were then a little surprised
 with the Road turning so much easterly,
 but we found it was to lead us through
 a gap in a Mountain, we have had a num-
ber of such gaps to go through between
 great Mountains, indeed for many miles
 back there is a very little but Mountains.
 we got to a Dutch house a while before
 night, 10 miles, but every thing looked
 so dirty, that with their leave, we prepar-
ed out of the Waggon, our own Supper
 and went to bed, but there was our
 greatest mortification, we had not
 been long in bed, before the Landlady, sent
 two Men who were travelers into
 our Room to lodge in another Bed,
 My Husband and Wm sleeping in the
 Waggon as usual, we lay very quiet
 and rose before day. 30 miles 25 7th day had a very rough Road 4 miles to
 Hoonston’s Tavern, where we wished
 to have gotten last evening, we then
 crossed green Briar Creek & passed along
 through the Woods, except a small Culti-
vated spot where, for a rarity, we saw
 some wheat growing, came on the bank
 of Mahony Creek, went up the side of it
 a Considerable distance between won-
derful Mountains, it is a very large
 Creek, after crossing it we came to Ma-
hony Mountain it took us near and
 hour to go over, the north side of it was
 amazingly steep, stoped 11 miles fed our
 Horses, and made some Chocolate for Break-
fast, started ½ past 9 had a very Rough
 Road crossed Shomokin Creek, then pass-
ed through Sunbury, the Capital of North-
umberland County, we then crossed
 the East branch of Susquehanna, ½ an
 hour Ferrying over, 1 mile across.
 Fed in Northumberland Town 8 miles,
 thence through rather a barren Soil, tho
 considerably cultivated, crossed Chilis-
quaque Creek, a considerable stream,
 got on the West branch of Susquehanna,
 the land good, as was also the road, reach-
ed Milton a small Town about 6, 12 miles
 put up at Brady's Tavern, but I being very
 unwell, soaked my feet, took a little medicine
 and went to Bed without my supper,
 before Sunset. Cousin being very kind
 in waiting on me, it was a time of
 much Rude Company here, and they
 were drinking and Fighting most of
 the night so that we were very much
 disturbed, indeed their Conduct did
 so impress my Mind with Sorrow, that
 I could not refrain from Weeping.
 31 miles 26 th and 1st of the Week, set out at 4,
 traveled several miles on the bank
 of the River, good road, cool Morn-
ing, considerable white frost.
 Stoped at David Shannon 's 8 miles, where
 we got a very good Breakfast and
 grain for our Horses. As soon as we
 got into the House I discouvered
 something was the matter with our
 Landlord, he made such heavy moans,
 and querying of him what Ailed him
 he said that he was about building
 and that he had thought so much a
bout it, that he was got low in his mind,
 I told him he had a fine Barn, a
 good looking place, and meterials
 ready for Building his House, and
 that I saw no sufficient cause for him to
 be discouraged, he said he had been
 a hardworking Man, and helped
 through many difficulties by the
 hand of Providence, but all was
 as nothing to him now, we told him
 that hand that hand which had hi-
therto helped him, would continue
 to help if he did but rely upon, and
 put his trust in it, he said he had
 strove with all his might but he
 could not help his situation, if he
 was as he once was, and saw one
 of us as he is now, he would have
 thought we might have helped it
 but we do not know untill we are
 tryed. he seemed very sensible of his
 situation and possessed of tender feel-
ings, indeed I felt a near sympathy
 for him, and my Mind was impressed
 with more of a lively sense of human
 frailty, excepted aided and supported
 by an Almighty Power, than I had
 heretofore known. ½ past 8 pro-
ceeded, passed through a small Village,
 crossed Munsy Creek, a large stream,
 and got to William Ellis ’s ½ past 12,
 10 miles. They were gone to meeting
 and it seemed pleasant to be among
 fnd s again, having scarcely had the
 sight of one since we left Lancaster.
 this Afternoon I wrote home, and
 in the evening the family were col-
lected, and William Ellis Junior read
 several Chapters in the Testament,
 wherein a Comfortable time of silence
 was witnessed to prevail. 18 miles 27 th 2nd day, this morning washed some Clothes
 3 OClock PM set out on our Journey, had
 a good Road tho mostly through the Woods,
 Crossed Loyalsock a large Water, got
 to William's port, the Capital of Lycoming County
 put up at James Winter s, where we were
 Comfortably accommodated, we had the
 Company of William Ellis , who was there
 on business 12 miles 28 th 3rd day, Started this Morning a
little after 4, in about 1 mile we stoped
at a house to by buy some Grain for
the Horses, being informed that it
was so scarce an Article further a
head that we should not be able to
procure any as we went along, Cou-
sin and I steped into a little house by
the Side of the land; while the Men were geting
 the grain, where we met with a Fa-
mily from Chester County, Baily's by name
 who invited us to eat Breakfast, which
kindness we accepted of, and proceed-
 ing we crossed Lycoming Creek a large
Water, then passed through a small
Village called Newberry, and asscend-
ed the Hill, then went through a
Wilderness Country very Moutainous
5 miles to one Brook's, the Men took
their Breakfast of a Cup of Milk and
Rye bread while the Horses were feeding
½ past 9 started, a very rough Road to
 the foot of the Allegany 6 miles, where
 we fed the Horses, had a Rock for our
Table, some of our Waggon store, with
excellent Water that issued from to-
ward the Top of the Mountain, serv-
ed to refresh the Weary Travelers,
but no peace for them, nor the Horses,
by reason of such swarms of little
Knats. ½ past one we moved forward,
the Road excessive Stony, computed
to be 6½ Miles over, which we were
3¾ hours a going, we put up at
Hookens Just at the otherside, were
were some of the tallest Pines, Hem-
locks &c that I ever saw 17½ miles 29
4th : Started about 4, after going
over a hill, had a very rough
swampy road along a Valley between
great Mountains, through such an a-
mazing thicket of Pines &c, and the
wheather being a little Cloudy, that it
looked almost dark, Cousin and I
I haveing prepared ourselves with
Stoves, while we were traveling
along before the Waggon, we heard
a noise, and looking back to see what was
the matter, we found, that as the Waggon
 was going down a Steep, and excessively
 Muddy place, a Bed that we had tyed
up in a Blanket, but was not suffi-
 ciently secured, Sliped out of the
fore end of the Waggon down into
the Mud, and a bottle of Milk that
we had purchased for Breackfast
which was stuffed within the Blanket
sliped out, yet it recieved no da-
maged, we took the blanket of the
bed and tyed it up in the Sheet, and
proceeded on, Washing the Blan-
ket at the first Creek we came to,
and sufficiently securing it on the
Top of the Waggon Cover to dry, we
presently came on a lively stream
of Water which followed the Road for
Several Miles Crossing it a great many
times, the last of which times the
bridge being gone, I observed a sap-
ling across the streem about 2 yards
from the Water, and on attempting
to go over on sd. tree when I got a-
bout ½ way; the log shaking, my foot
sliped, and in I went, tho the Water
was but shallow yet I had to wade through
tho it was early to stop for Breakfast
 Yet as I had got my feet Wet, we
 concluded to make a fire and get
our Breakfast, and feed the horses, continu-
ing through the Wilderness we came to
Pine Creek, in five or 6 miles crossed
it thirteen times, got to Morris's Mills
about 12 OClock 12½ Miles from where
we lodged. When at William Ellis 's we
met with Francis King 's daughter, and
she told us we could not get the Wag-
gon through the Wilderness to her Fa-
thers, and at this Mill we recieved
the like information, which account
was very discouraging, after feeding
our Horses & geting some dinner we
set off, half past two, Cousin & I set
of on foot, having a Mountain to as-
scend we got a great distance before
the Waggon, and and stoping at one
 Jackson's, until the Waggon came up,
they appeared glad to see us, tho no ac-
quaintance, the woman said she was pleased
 to see us so chearfull, but her hus-
band said it would take us 6 weeks
 to get to King s Settlement with the
Waggon, he advised us to call at Moses
Wilson's and get his Son to assist us in
 getting along, we then Crossed Pine
Creek at the 2 nd fork, stoped a few mi-
nutes to see Sampson Babb , who re-
moved from Chester County, and got
to James Yarnall 's, 6 miles, his Father's
name was Daniel , and used to live
 somewhere about Middletown in
Delaware County, we lodged here 18½ m 30 th 5th day set of at 5 OClock,
proposing to get our Breakfast
at Moses Wilson 's which was 5 miles
on our way and the first house
we would come to, but when
we arrived at it, the house was
empty, and no body left to en-
quire of, for here we were to get
furter information, but being
a little cold, and a great way before
the Waggon, we made bold to open
the door and go in, where we found
a little fire, which we kindled
up and sat warming ourselves
 near half an hour before the Wag-
gon came. then on confering togather
 concluded to go on at a Venture, by a Map of
the Road, our kind fnd Thomas Stewardson had
furnished us with, we knew that we had left the
State Road, we pursued our Journey, and in
about half a Mile we came to a fork where tak-
ing the left hand road, went on a piece look-
ing every way for a house, through very
swampy Woods, we presently
came to a
2 nd fork, we were now entirely at a loss
 which path to take, but after going along
both roads a considerable distance, we
were informed where Moses Wilson had
 moved to, but his House was so much out
of the way and such a bad road to it, that
we concluded to go about one mile fur-
ther on, to James Iddings 's to breakfast,
his House being near the Road, where
Moses , and Wife came over to see us,
and I thought it strange to see such
good looking fnd s in the Wilderness, so
remote from Meetings, and more sur-
prising to see Mary Iddings in such a little
Cabbin, however we spent an hour or
two very agreeably with them, tho the
 account the gave us of the Road was very
discouraging, Moses informing, that
he did not think we would be able to get
the Waggon more than 10 or 15 miles fur-
ther, and that far with difficulty, and
that he would send one of his sons with
us to the next house, which was about
8 miles. at 11 OClock we bid our kind
fnd s farewell and pursued our Journey,
Cousin and I going before, giving Warn-
ing of the difficult places, My Husband 
and Moses Wilson Junr holding the Wag-
gon, the banks were so steep and sidling
that it appeared impossible to get along
without upsetting. in a while we cross-
ed another large branch of the Pine Creek, and
after traveling a piece further we got
stoped by the trees that were across the
Road, we then got help from one Boat-
mans, and it took 5 men near two
hours to open to Road to his House,
so as to get the Waggon along, tho it
was not half a Mile, here it looked
likely we must leave it, tho we en-
 deavoured to hire help to go with us
to King s Settlement
to assist in open-
ing the Road, but there were but two
 families here, and no neighbours
near, and they busy planting corn &
 nearly out of Provisation, and no Mill
within 20 miles, the Woman said she could
supply us with Milk and butter, but that
she had nothing else except a little Veneson
which was a very good relish for our
Coffee that we had prepared for our
Dinner, we now got to unloading
our Waggon, and packing up our
goods suitable to be carried on horse-
back, we laped up one Bed in the
Waggon Cover, which Cover served us
for a Tent the two nights we lodged in
the Woods, we sewed up a sheet and
and filled it and a Bag with Clooth-
 ing &c and after other arangments
the day was so far spend, we conclud-
ed to stay all night, we got supper,
put some Bread to rise, and went
to Bed. 31 st 6th day a Clear Cold Morning, very
white frost, some Clothes I washed
last night were frozen stiff, baked
Bread, got Breakfast, and after load-
ing our Horses, about 9 OClock set out
on our Journey pretty chearful, tho we stoutly
loaded on three Horses, yet we were
Oblidged to leave behind us one Bed
and two large Trunks, hoping to get
them along sometime this summer,
We presently had Pine Creekto Cross
 which our Landlady, put Cousin and
myself over, in a Canoe, we traveled
on through the Wilderness, up the Pine
 Creek until about one, when we turn-
ed our Horses out to pasture while
we prepared our Dinner, there being
plenty of fine grass on the bottoms
near Sd Creek, about 2 OClock we startd
and Journeyed on until ½ past 6, then
pitched Camp, and prepared for
a Nights Lodging in the Woods, we
put forks in the Ground, and with
our Waggon Cover, made a pretty
good Tent, then after taking some
Chocolate went to Bed, tho our lodg-
ing was pretty Comfortable yet I
got but little Sleep, by the marks
on the trees we came 15 miles 6 mo 1 st 7th day a Clear Cool Morn-
ing, at 5 OClock we set out again,
 travelled till 8 then stoped and got
Breakfast, it is almost impossible
to tell how often we have Crossed
Pine Creek since we first came on
its waters, but now being up the third
fork we expect shortly to leave it. ½ past
9 set out again, I mounted one of
the Horses having the Bed for a saddle
 the Road very Baggy and Rough
until after after leaving the Waters
of Pine Creek, then pased through
 some good land near the head Wa-
ters of the Allegeny, and towards
 evening at the foot of a Mountain
where we had plenty of Water, we
 pitched our Camp, and prepared
for Lodging, had a good nights rest
 after a fataguing days Journey of
26 miles, Cousin Walking all the
 way, I the greater part, she did it
of Choice. 2 nd 1 day of the Week a Cloudy Morning
Set out at 5 OClock, traveling until
 traveling until 8, on Crossing
Oswago Creek, a Branch of the Allegeny,
it began to Rain, we pitched camp &
got Breakfast, started at 9 and
arrived at John Bell 's at 12 in Kings 
 Settlement his Wife seeing us coming
ran out to meet us with Tears run-
 ing down, we were glad to see her,
the Joy was mutual, the sight of a
 fnd after so perelious a Journey, how
consoleing, having been more than
 two days and nights in the Wilder-
ness, since we left the last house. Altho
the Journey has been trying, yet I felt
 something so animating, and reviving
 encouraging to revive, that my
 Heart was filled with a precious sweet-
ness which was a full consolation
for our most trying seasons, Oh
may I abide in the patience with
my Eye single to him who know-
 eth what is best for us. -- After
dinner, Benjamin and William 
 went 3 miles to Francis Kings 
to see after a Canoe to take us
down to Tunesassah,, where they staid
all night, and we continued with Mary
Bell, her Husband not at home.
12 miles 3 rd 2nd day of the Week, a Cloudy Morn-
ing, about 10 my Husband and
 Wm returned, Francis King coming
with them, bringing Horses for Cousin
 and myself to Ride on, We went to
F King s to dinner, and it looking
likely for Rain, they wished us to stay
 all night but being desirous to
get to our distined home, thought
if we could get 12 miles down the
River to Robert Hoops 's, we might
next day reach Tunesassah, where
we were anxious to get, we left Fran-
cis's about 3 his son and daughter go-
ing with us, butbefore we had got
far it began to thunder, and the
Gust increased, until it became
a very great rain, we stoped at a little
Cabbin a While until the heaviest
of it was over, but our Bed, Clothes
&c were on the Horses I was afraid
they would get very Wet, and hav-
ing nothing but a foot path to
travel and the Bushes
thick and
Wet, made it very disagreeable
getting along, we got to Robert
Hoops's about 7 and were kindly
received by his Housekeeper, he not
being at home, but was out look-
ing after Provision, in several
places where we have been latterly been it has
been the case, scarce of Provisions
 which is their situation here, none for
us, nor no Canoe to take us down,
we having some with us, got our
own supper and went to Bed 15m 4 th 3rd day Cloudy and like for Rain, my
Husband , and Wm Embree with F King 
set of on Horseback for Tunesassah, pro-
posing to get Joel Swain with some
other help to bring up a Canoe to
take us and our baggage down 5 th 4th day of the week, this day has
been spent with anxious desires
to see a Canoe, we feel very dull
and lonesome, two days waiting. 6 th 5th day Rose early, got break-
fast and set of with a Man that
was going down the River, and in
about 11 miles we met Joel Swain &
 an Indian with a Canoe coming
for us, which Sight was very agree-
able, and we pretty soon got into
their Canoe, with our baggage and
proceeded, about 12 OClock we stoped
 at Peter Sniders Saunders, a White Man, his Wife
was taken Captive by the Indians when
she was about three years Old, and had
lived among them ever since, she
cannot talk any English, we got
some Milk of them to eat with our
Bread, then proceeded, and by
 5 OClock got to Tunesassah, were
my dear Benjamin was burning
brush, and William at Work with
the Planes, they were all glad to see
us, as we were to get home and see
them, 40 miles 7 th of the Mo 6th day we got to wash
ing some of our dirty Clothes, a great
many of the natives came to see us
through the coarse of this day, am
among our Visitters, was Corn-
Planters sister, who said she was
glad the good spirit had brought us
safe through our long Journey, which
raised something so endearing toga-
ther, with such comfortable sensations
 that my Heart was filled with gratitude,
and in the secret effusions of my spirit
was ready to utter this Language, "great
and marvelous are thy Works, Lord God
 Almighty 10 th 2nd day Jacob Taylor went to
inform the Indians of our being come,
and the Young Men here having sent
an address to them, they told him they
would confer togather and let us know. 11 th 3rd day We recieved word from
the Indians, that they had concluded
to meet in Council in three days, at
a place called Cold Spring 3½ miles
from this place, 14 th 6th day Agreeable
 to the conclusion
of the Indians we went this day to the
Council, Jacob Taylor having been
 very unwell for several days, tho
so much better this Morning, that we
 encouraged his going with us, and
about 9 OClock we all set of togather
 taking a little provision with us, which
we partook of under a shed in the Town
while the Indians were collecting, about
11 OClock we went into the Council House
 where were a large number of Indians.
 10 Chiefs, and a good many Women. Old
 Connidias, after our sitting a While,
 opened the Council with expressing
 thanks to the great spirit in bringing
 us safely through our long Journey,
 also, that so many of these were col
lected there to day. Desiring the War
riors to pay attention to what should
 be communicated to them, then in
formed they were ready to hear what 
 what we had to lay lay before them, Henry O'Bail Corn
planters Son was our interpreter.
 The Adress from the Committee
 on our behalf was first read, then part
 of an Epistle to the Women, likewise
 a speech from the Young Men residing
 here, concerning sowing, grinding
 &c. They were also informed, not with
standing our Journey had been long
 and trying, we felt peace of Mind
 in being with them, and hoped that
 our sisters the Indian Women, when
 we became a little more acquainted
 would be willing to be instructed, tho
 we let them know we had no more to
Day at present. After a considerable
 time of conference among themselves
 the following is the substance of a speech
 delivered by one of the Chiefs. Brothers Deweista, meaning Quakers We return thanks to the great
 Spirit to see you all well, and that the
 great Spirit has preserved your Wo
men on so long a Journey, and that
 they are arrived safe in our country, &
 we are much pleased they are going to
 stay amongst us to instruct our Wo
men. We return thanks to the great
 Spirit that he has put this into your
 Hearts. We wish you therefore to
 make your Minds easy. They also
 seemed pleased with Hollidays Epis
tle, but that they were at a loss for
 an answer, as two of the heads
 of the Women were not there. After
 sitting near three hours in
 Council, exceed ing ly Warm and Close,
 we were dismissed, the Indians conti
nuing their conference two horus longer
 on the business the young men laid before them
 and appeared much pleased with their proposals
 which were as follows Brothers attend You know we have
 often talked to you about opening a good Road
 from this Town to Tunasapah in or
der to make it more easy for your
 People to come to Mill. If you will
 join together and open this Road, we
 have concluded to give you 7000
 feet of Boards. This will enable you
 to finish your Houses, to have them
 warm against next winter. Brothers, you know we began to
 grind for you about the time you
 were making sugar last spring, we
 will continue to grind for you until
 next season for sugar making, with
out taking toll which will make
 one year. And if any of you want
 boards we will sell them to you
 for four shillings but we don’t
 intend to trust any, because we want
 to keep the Chain of frendship bright,
 and if you Want any of your own logs
 sawed into boards, or Scantling, if you
 will cut and haul the logs to the Mill
 we will saw them for one half Brothers these advantages which
 we now proposed unto you, are intend
ed to encourage you to pursue habits
 of Industry and Sobriety. We wish you
 to keep your Minds strong to pursue this
 path, then we think your Substance will
 increase, and the great Spirit will
 help your Labours. Brothers we don’t want to tire your
 Ears with many words, but it affords us much
 Satisfaction to see your Industry this Spring,
 in enclosing so many fields to plant corn
 &c in, and that you continue your good
 resolution against the use of Spirits
 and Liquours. We repeat it again, be
 strong in your Minds against this great
 Enemy, and never let him rise up a
gain. We have all united our Minds
 together in this Speech, and shall de
liver you a Copy of it, in order that
 your memories may be kept bright. I have felt satisfaction in being
 with the Indians today, and Jacob Tay
lor says he has felt as much peace in
 attending some of their Councils, as is
 common to experience in attending a
 Quarterly Meeting. But it will take us
 some time before their Language will be
come familiar and we can get to
 understand it. __ About 30 of
 the Indians has since joined, and opened
 the Road proposed, which will be
 an advantage to us as well as to
 them, a grand piece of work for
 Indians, it being copletley done. Cornplanter did not attend the
 Counsil, but has since been here. I
 did not deliver the message to him
 for want of an Interpreter, Jacob
 Taylor saying he thought he could
 not make him understand which
 of the friends that were here was thee. There was a paragraph in the address
 from the Committee, to the Indians, sent
 by us, recommending, that when
 any of them has done any thing, that a
nother does not like, they should not differ
 about it, but forgive him that had
 done the wrong, for the good Spirit
 forgives us when we do wrong, if we
 are sorry for it. I do not know but it
 had some good effect, for about two days
 after, they called a Council, sent for Corn
planter, made up all the uneasiness, &
 restored him to his former post, with
 the same powers. He has since been
 here, and said when any thing happened
 to them in future, they had better try to
 make it up among themselves, and
 not go tell it abroad over the
 Country for that made it worse, he
 also told us of some other advice he gave
 them, which I thought was very suitable.
 And he further said that Old friends
 down the Country might be informed
 that the difference was all done away,
 and that there was nothing between
 us, meaning the Quakers, and them. It was very agreeable information to
 us, to hear that Cornplanter was restor
ed, for his Judgment in matters of im
portance was of consequence. He wanted
 to see some of our linnen, or Manufac
turing, and said if two or more of their
 Women could get in the way of making
 they could learn the others.
 I think best of further describing the
 new house we are settled in, and its Si
tuation. It is a pretty Commodious
 two story Log house 22 by 36 feet, the
 Floors and partitions laid rough until
 the Floor season, the Lower story is intended
 to be finished this summer, and the re
maining Work of the House next
 Winter. It is divided into a Parlour,
 Kitchen, and two Chambers. One of the
 Rooms is occupied by my husband
 and I, the other by Cousin, up stairs
 one fine place, 4 rooms intended ,where
 the Men sleep. The small hosue where
 the Young Men lived before the move
 into this is occupied by a white fa
mily who has undertaken to clear
 20 Acres of Land this Summer, and
 are now engaged in it. When that is
 done, the House finished, and some other
 improvements made, it will be a
 handsome place. With the mills about
 30 Veareh from the house, South West corner
 the Mill Race about 8 veareh from
 the Door, South, the Garden north, a
 Road South to the Whitemans house
 the Road to River nearly a North
 Coarse ¾ of a Mile from our dwelling.
 The house of Ipenesinguhla, where the
 Young Men lived when they first
 into th settled when they came to the
 Indian Country, 2 ½ miles from the
