 An Indian Speech In the summer of 1805, a number of the principal Chiefs 
 and warriors of the six Nations of Indians principally 
 Seneca assembled at Buffaloe Creek in the state of 
 New York, at the particular request of a Gentleman 
 Missionary from the state of Massachusett, The Missionary being furnished with an Interpre 
 ter and accompanyed by the Agent of the U States for 
 Indian affairs, met the Indians in council, when 
 the following talk took place First by the Agent 
 Brothers of the six Nations, I rejoice to meet you at 
 this time, and thank the Great spirit that he hath 
 preserved you in health, and given me another oppo 
 rtunity of takeing you by the hand Brothers, The person who now sits by me is a friend 
 who has come a great distance to hold a talk with 
 you, he will inform you what his business is, and 
 and it is my request that you should listen 
 with attention to his words Missionary 
 My friends I am thankful for the opportunity 
 afforded us in meeting together at this time, I had 
 a great desire to see you and enquire into your state 
 and welfare, for this purpose I have traveled a 
 great distance being sent by your old friends 
 the Boston Missionary society; you will recollect 
 they formerly sent Missionaries amongst you, to 
 instruct you in Religion and I aboud for your 
 good, Altho they have not heard from you for 
 a long time yet they have not forgotten there 
 Brothers of the six Nations, and are still 
 anxious to do you good Brothers 
 I have not come to get your lands or
 Money but to enlighten your minds, and to 
 instruct you how to worship the Great Spirit, agreeable
 agreeable to his mind, and will, and to preach to you 
 the Gosple of his son Jesus Christ, there is but one Religion 
 and one way to serve God, and if you do not embrace the 
 right way you cannot be happy hereafter; you have 
 never worshiped the Great Spirit in a maner acceptable 
 to him but have all your lives been in great errors and 
 darkness, to indeavour to remove these errors, and open 
 your eyes, so that you might see clearly is my business 
 with you Brothers
 I wish to talk with you as one friend talks 
 with another, and if you have any objections to recieve 
 the Religion which I preach I wish you to take them 
 and I will, and I will endeavour to satisfy your minds 
 and remove the the objections Brothers
 I want you to speak your minds freely; for 
 I wish to reason with you on the subject, and if possible 
 to remove all doubts if there be any on your minds 
 the subject is an important one, and it is of consequ 
 ence that you give it an early attention, while the offer 
 is made you; you find the Boston Missionary society 
 will continue to send you good and faithful Ministers 
 to instruct and strength you in Religion, if on your
 part you are willing to receive them Brothers 
 Since I have been in the part of the country 
 I have visited some of your small Villages, and talked 
 with your people, they appear willing to receive instruc 
 tion, but as they look up to you as your Older Brother 
 in council, the want first to know your opinion on 
 the subject; you have now heard what I have to propose 
 at present, I hope you will take it into consideration, 
 and give me an answer before we part After about two hours consultation amongst 
 themselves, the Cheif commonly called Red Jacket 
 by the white people arose and spoke as follows Friend and Brother
 It was the will of the great 
spirit that we should meet together this day, 
 he orders all things and has given us a fine Day for our 
 council. He has taken his garment from before the 
 Sun, and caused it to shine with brightness upon us, 
 our eyes are open that we see clearly, our ears have 
 been unstoped that we have been able to hear distinctly 
 the words you have spoken, for all these favours we 
 thank the great spirit, and him only. Brother 
 This council fire was kind led by you, it 
 was at your request that we came together at this time 
 we have listned with attention to what you have 
 said, you requested us to speak our minds freely, 
 this gives us great Joy, for we now consider that we 
 stand upright before you, and can speak what we 
 think, all have heard your voice and all speak to 
 you now as one Man, our Minds are agreed Brother, 
 You say you want an answer to your talk 
 before you leave this place, it is right you should have 
 one, as you are a great Distance from home, and 
 we dont wish to ditain you, but we will first look 
 back a little, and tell you what our fathers have 
 told us, and what we have heard from the white people 
 Brother listen to what we say. There was a time 
 when our forefathers owned this great Land, their seats 
 Extended from the rising to the setting sun, the Great 
 spirit had made it for the use of Indians he had cre 
 ated the Buffaloe, the Deer, and other animals for 
 food, he made the Bear & the Beaver, their skins served 
 us for clothing, he had scattered them over the country 
 and taught us how to take them, he had caused the 
 earth to produce corn for bread, all this he had done 
 for his red children because he loved them; if we had 
 some disputes about hunting ground they were generally 
 settled without the shedding of much blood; but an 
 Evil day came upon us your forefathers crossed the 
 great watter and landed on this Island; their number were
 were small, they found friends and not enemies, they 
 told us they had fled from their own country for fear of 
 wicked men, and had come here to enjoy their religion, 
 they asked for a small seat, we took pity on them, 
 Graned their request, and they sat down amongst us, 
 we gave them corn & meat, they gave us poison (alluding
 it as supposed to ardent spirits) in retuurn. the white people 
 had now found our country, tidings were carried back,
 and more came amongst us, yet we did not fear them
 we took them to be friends they called us Brothers, we 
 believed them, and gave them a large seat, at length 
 their numbers had greatly increased, they wanted 
 more land, they wanted our country, our eyes were 
 opened and our minds became uneasy, wars took place 
 Indians were hired to fight against Indians, and 
 many of our people were destroy'd, they also brought 
 strong liquors amongst us, it was strong and power 
 ful, and has slain thousands. Brother, our seats were once large and yours 
 were small, you have now become a great people; 
 and we have scarcely a place left to spread our 
 Blankits, you have got our country, but are not 
 satisfied, you want to force your Religion upon us. Brother, continue to listen, you say you are sent 
 to instruct us how to worship the Great spirit agreeably to 
 his mind, and if we do not take hold of the Religion which you 
 teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter, you say that you 
 are right and we are lost, how do you know this to be 
 true; we understand that your religion is written in a 
 book, if it was intended for us as well as you, why has 
 not the great spirit given to us, and not only to us, 
 but why did he not give to our forefathers the know 
 ledge of that book, with the means of understanding 
 it rightly; we only know what you tell us about 
 it, how shall we know what to believe, being so often 
 deciev'd by the white people Brother, you say there is but one way to worship 
 and serve the Great spirit, if there is but one Religion 
 Religion, why do you white people differ so much about 
 it? why not all agreed, as you can all used the Book? Brother, we do not understand these things, we are told 
 that your religion was given to your forefathers, and how 
 been handed down from father to son, we also have a 
 Religion, which was given to our forefathers, and has 
 been handed down to us their Children, we worship 
 in that way, it teaches us to be thankful for all the 
 favours we Recieve, to love each other and to be united, 
 we never quarrel about Religion. Brother, the Great spirit has made us all, but 
 he has made a great difference between his white & 
 Red children, he has given us different complexions & 
 different customs, to you he has given the arts, to 
 these he has not opened our eyes, we know these things 
 to be true; since he has made so great a differenc 
 between us in other things, why may we not conclude 
 that he has given us a different Religion according to 
 our understandings; The Great spirit does right, he 
 honors what is best for his children, we are satisfied. Brother, we do not wish to destroy your Religion, 
 or take it from you, we only want to enjoy our own. Brother, we are told that you have been preach 
 ing to the white people in this place, These people 
 are our neighbours, we are acquainted with them, 
 we will wait a little while and see what effect 
 your preaching has upon them, if we find it 
 does them good, makes them honest and less dispos'd 
 to cheat Indians, we will then consider again what 
 you have said. Brother You have now heard our answer to your 
 talk, and this is all we have to say at present, as we are 
 going to part we will come and take you by the hand 
 and hope the Great spirit will protect you on your 
 journey and return you safe to your friends. As the Indians began to approach the missionary, 
 he rose hastily from his seat and replied, he could not 
 take them by the hand, that there was no fellowship between 
 the Religion of God and the words of the Devil, this being 
 interpreted to the Indians, they smiled, and retired in a 
 peacable manner. It being afterwards suggested to the Missionary that 
 his Reply to the Indians was rather indiscreet, 
 he observ'd that he supposed the ceremony of shaking 
 hands wou'd be reciev'd by them as a token, that he 
 assented to what they had said, being otherways inform'd 
 he said he was sorry for the expression.
