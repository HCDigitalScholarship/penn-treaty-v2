 The Following is an account of the Exercise & Experience of an Indian
 Man as Related by him self to a Number of Friends, says I Dont often open
 my mind to any, but I now feel the way is open. and more than a freedom to
 Do it some years Past it was laid upon me to Encourage others to Do well;
 I thought I was a Poore ignorant Indian, I could not Encourage others to Do
 well, so I shoved it away (Puting his hand out as tho he had Put it from him,
 then fetching his hand back again & laying it on his breast, says it was brought back
 again & laid upon me, I then shoved it away again, & so he Did a number of times
 Implying the reasoning state of his Mind It was then opened to my view, that
 the truth was a Very precious thing, very precious Indeed. Oh how Precious it Doth look
 to me. He can say it is innocent, we can say it is Innocent, thats all we can say.
 words cannot say half. I then said with Peter Depart from me O Lord, I am
 a sinful man but it was brought back & laid upon me again some
 morning as I was going to a Prespeterian meeting I saw a flock of sheep along
 before me Puting his hand to his Eyes, says I Did not see them with these Eyes.
 they appeard to be traveling a long before me. the foremost ones was half grown
 large, & I heard them talking to one another. Puting his hand to his Ears says but
 not with those Ears saying to one another God speed help you on the way, the
 hindmost looked Poore, small, their heads hund Down seemed allmost ready to
 give out I wondered what it should mean Then something come & talked
 with me Puting his hand to his Breast, says it talked to me here, and told
 me, these are my sheep & this Day you shall see them lift up their heads in
 hope, & feed on the bread of Life Then it said to me, them that are before are
 the Priest & Deacons, they are grown fat & full, they can Encourage one an
 others but they forget the Poore of the flock. I went on to the meeting, the
 Priest Preached, Prayed, & sung & used the Very words, I heard the fat sheep
 use one to another, And after he had Done, I thought it my Duty to tell them
 what I see on the way; so I Did & thought I saw my Vision fulfilled, the Poore
 of the flock, lifted up their heads in hope & fed on the bread of Life, the
 Priest acknowledged in the Presence of the People, that what I said was True
 and that the Truth, had been Declared among them by a Poore Ignorant 
 an; Then I went home Very comfortable, Oh, how comfortable I Did feel
 Then sometimes I feel my mind Drawn in to simpathy with some, I want to
 go & see them, I was yet would think it other to Do well,
 I Did not want folks to think so I feel such a simpathy for one poore family
 I want to go see them, at I Did not no how to Do, so I thought I would take a
 grist on my back & go beyond where they Live, so I Did, & when I come
 back I stop in, It was just night, there was a rich man lived on the other side
 of the road, I suppose I would let me have bed to sleep in, but I thought I
 had rather lay by the mans fire, I felt their worth, I wanted to be with them,
 In the morning when I going away I asked the women to hand me a bowle
 she was unarilling I the most, she got one for I took out Part of my
 meal & left it with her, felt the wants of the Poore Children, so that are not
 carry all my meal away then I took leave of them & went home Quietly. And so kept along when I feel my mind in simpathy with any, I try some
 way to go & see them, began to think I was geting along Prety well, soone Day I was
 thinking I should go to meeting 3 or 4 Days hence, I began to think what I should say
 when I should come there, so I thought It over, I got something fixed in my mind, I
 thought it would Do Prety well, I hung it up, & by & by I took it looked at it again
 I thought it would Do very well, I hung it up so I Did good many times before meeting Day come
 I went to meeting & after the Priest got through, I stood up & said it off as well as I could
 and I thought I said it off Prety well, but Oh how I was Distress & so I Passed along a long
 time, Did not know what the matter was Then something come & talked to me & says, Did
 you ever know a Great man if he want Great Business Done away to Congress, or to
 Philadelphia to send a Poore ignorant unlerned man to Do it No I say I Did not,
 No more wont Great Spirit take you well I thought sure Enough I have been mista
ken I never have known what good is, And Oh, how I was Distress, but Did not
 know where to find good (This he supposed to be the bad spirit coming at a time
 when he had mised it at the Endeavouring to Persuade him, that he never had kno
wn what good was, Then says somthing & he come & talked me, which he sup
posed was the good spirit, and says Great One knows all things, he can Do all
 things, he knows what is Best, And if a King want great business Done, & he has
 servents under him, if he wants to send one to Do business for him, if he is a wise
 Learned man, he ought to say what the King tell him to say, if he is an ignorant
 unlerned man, if he can talk, he can say over after the King, just what the
 King tell him to say, if it 2, 3 or 4 words more or less just as the King says
 just so he ought to say Then it says to one supose one of your neighbour
 have a Piece of to him, a very got when it was give
 to him, he takes it, feels of it, looks at it; handles it; hangs it up, then by & by
 he takes it Down, he feels of it, handles it, looks at it; hangs it up, so he Do a
 great many times, & keep it 3 or 4 Days, til it begins to stink, then he take
 it, cook it & set before you, to Eat, would you Eat it no I say I would not
 Eat it well it says just so your Preaching was the other Day The Great
 spirit wont have it folk wont have it Then it came in to my
 mind the Passage when there was a Piece of money brought to our savious
 I Don't remember he asked them whose Image & Inscription was on it
 They told him well he told them to render to ceasars the things that
 are cesars, & to God things that are God I see my Parking had
 Cesar inserption on it Because it was something of any own Prepareing
 it Did not come from the Great Spirit, therefore it had not his superscripti
on on it, & he would not have it, & that was the reason I was so troubled; I see
 that Every thing of mans contrivance had cesar superscription on it
 and only that, that comes Immediately from the Great Spirit, that would return
 to him, or that would be food for his True sheep, my says christ know any
 & they follow but the Voice of a stranger they will not follow
 I thought some time heard a strange Voice, Puting his hand to his Breast
 says Did not feel I love to feel it here then Then it opened in my mind the Passage where the multitude followed our savior
 in to the , the disciples seemed willing to send them away & give them no
thing; but he knew their wants, he Did not want them to by the way he
 caled on the Disciples, & asked them if they had any thing for them, they say we have
 a few loves & a few fishes, but what are they among so many, but he knew what
 he was going to Do, he Directed that the multitude should all sit Down in compane
 on the grass; then he caled on the Disciples & they give all up to him that they
 had, then he took & broke it, & Blessed it; then gave it to the Disciples, after all this
 was Done, then he Commanded them to hand it to the Multitude, then it was food for
 them, they had Enough to spare Just so I see it is now, when the Great spi
rit is Pleased to brake the bread of life, hand it to his Disciples, & Command them to
 hand it to the People, then it is food for them Now after this it was Laid upon
 me again to Encourage othersto Do well, but the work looked to be so great, & I
 felt like such a Poore Ignorant Indian, that I thought I could not give up to it
 And said to that that talked with one there is a great many that can do better
 than I can, take some this one & Excuse one, It asked me who; I said such a
 one, it told one to fetch him up, I Did in any mind Putting his hand to his breast
 as tho he brought it to the witness in him self, but he would not have him, but
 shoved him away & so in this way he said he broought up a number, but he
 would not have them, & told me I must give up Now I found the Great
 Spirit condescended to weak state & opened things to my understanding in
 a way to meet my capacity so I found it was necessary to wait upon him
 to be instructed, what to say, how to say, & when and when I could say 
 the servents that was sent out to Invite in to the feast, It is Done Lord as those
 commanded & yet there is room, then I find there is yet room for more Exercise
 more labour, more Invitation, the way is not shut up in any Heart
 Then it opened in my mind the circumstance of Joseph, how he was sold by
 his brethren, & the reason why they sold him, he was Designd by the great
 spirit to be greater then his brethren, he had some Dreams that seamed to
 lead them to think so, some of them had a mind to kill him, others thought
 best to sell him, & see what would become of his Dreams, so they sold him, he
 was carried Down of to Egypt, & Put into Prison, wrongfully, but the Great spi
rit was with him there & knew what he was a going to bring abought
 get along Pretty well for a while, there was some
body in Prison with Joseph, and he was released, & Joseph told him when
 he come in the Presence of the King to remember him, but he forgot Jo
seph till he was brought into a strait, the King had some Dreams
 I cannot read much, I cannot tell just how it was, but I remember he
 Dreamed something about some Ears of corn, Eating up some Ears of
corn, & there nobody could Interpret his Dreams, then this man
 remembered Joseph, he was sent for, the Great Spirit was with him & knowed
 all things, so he could tell the King the interpretation of his Dreams So when he told him what was a going to the King believed it
 and thought it best to Prepare against the time of Famine, that Joseph
 said was coming, & he thought there was no one so suitable as Joseph
 because the Great Spirit was with him, so he put all Power in to his hand
 only the King was greater, so Joseph ordered store houses to be built & laid
 up Corn for the time of famine that was coming & he had the Keys of the
 stores, now the famine come, his brethren come to want, they had sold
 Joseph, & Did not intend to bow to him, but they heard there was corn in
 Egypt, their father sent some of them Down to buy some, they applyed to Joseph
 he knew them, they Did not know him, he asked if they had any brethren & whe
ther they had a Father living, they told him about them, so after a while Joseph
 sent for them, they all went Down & bowed to Joseph, for there was no other way for
 them to kept alive Now it looked Plain to me, that we have a measure of
 the good spirit afforded to lead us to Instruct us & it is greater then we are & de
signed to Rule over us, or we may Do as that tells us, or we may mind the bad spirit
 But if we Do, it will not yeald the Peaceable fruits of rightiousness, & we may say
 to the good spirit, we will not have this man to rule over us, we may Put it away
 and sell it, & it may be Put into Prison, yet a famine will overtake there, & though
 they may go into a far Country, far away from that, that is Right, & and not Even
 know Joseph or this good spirit, yet that will know them, & it will there rise
 up & Plead with them, now there is no other way, but to go back again to that; that
 is wright, & acknowledge Joseph to be greatest he has all Power Commited to him
 he has the Keys of , & they that will not him, must Die. The same Disposition, that was in Josephs Brethren, and in People in the
 Days of the Apostles, is now in People, I have seen some folks, so simple, that they
 got mad with a gun & Broke it all to Pieces, because it had Done some Mischief,
 as tho the Gun was to blame, if it had not been Charged, & then fire Put to it,
 it would not; Done any harm, so when the apostles were Charged with some
thing & the Fire of Divine love operated on them, her they could Do Execution
 but after it had Passed through them, they were like the Emty Gun, it was
 not they that Did it; it was that flame of Divine love & here the People
 took the apostles, & Put them to Death, as tho they Done it, & thought to
 stop it from spreading, but they could not, for it operated through otherng
 And it operates the purpose
