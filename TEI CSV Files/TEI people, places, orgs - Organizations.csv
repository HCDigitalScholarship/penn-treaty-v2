The displacement and consolidation of their tribes continued throughout the fraudulent Walking Purchase (1737) by the Pennsylvania government, as well as the 1758 Treaty of Easton, which put an end to the Lenape's involvement in French and Indian War by relocating them to Ohio.

Stuyvesant, however, negotiated for the inhabitants’ continued right to religious freedom. English occupation was finalized by the 1667 Treaty of Breda. The Dutch later recaptured New Amsterdam in 1673 and renamed the city “New Orange,” but were subsequently bankrupted and forced conclude the war by ceding their territory through the Treaty of Westminster.

An Algonquian-speaking people residing in the Great Lakes region, specifically around Western Lake Michigan.

The pressure of advancing settlers led to some consolidation of the fragmented tribes. Their response to the Revolutionary War was mixed, with some Miami supporting the Revolutionaries, others the British, and many professing no open hostility to either. Regardless, in an effort to secure its newly-won territory after the war, the United States began the Northwest Indian War (1785-1795) against a large confederacy of Indian tribes in the recently vacated Northwest Territory, among which were the Miami and their famous leader, Little Turtle. The aftermath of this campaign was a series of major land cessions, particular examples being the Treaty of Greenville (1795) and the Treaty of Mississiniwas (1825). Some Miami became US citizens and retained individual ownership of their native land in Indiana, while those who chose to retain sovereignty migrated first to Kansas, and then to Oklahoma.  ",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_people ; http://miamination.com/node/11,

Most of their settled villages were located between the Schoharie and East Canada Creeks in the Mohawk Valley, with hunting territory stretching towards the Adirondacks and the eastern Susquehanna. In 1667 they founded the Kahnewake Village near Montreal, and roughly a century later founded Akwasasne (also known as St. Regis). They were part of the lesser-known Seven Nations Confederacy, a group of Huron, Abenaki, and Mohawk peoples who were first French and then English allies. Both Mohawk groups fought against the colonists in the Revolutionary War, after which most of their New York land was taken by the debt-ridden new government. Joseph Brant and John Desoronto led their dispossessed tribesmen into Canada, around Ontario, or on the Bay of Quinte, where they founded the Six Nations of the Grand River. Much controversy resulted from US treaties with both Mohawk groups, both of which contested the other's authority to cede New York lands. The Six Nation's Treaty of Canandaigua (1794) allowed them to own land in the United States and produced a small community back in Mohawk Valley named Canajoharie, while the Seven Nations signed a 1796 treaty that guaranteed the St. Regis reserve (Akwesasne) straddling the New York-Ontario border in exchange for New York land cessions.",,sxntns,Handbook of the North American Indians Northeast ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_people ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Nations_of_Canada;Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Nations_of_Canada#cite_ref-ReferenceA_2-0; http://www.wampumchronicles.com/toomanychiefs7.html; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akwesasne,

Originally part of the Pequot Tribe, the Mohegan slowly detached themselves and ultimately fought as English allies in the 1637 Pequot War, from which they emerged one of the most powerful New England tribes (having absorbed the remaining Pequot). Their population steadily declined in 17th and 18th centuries, however, largely as a result of war and their frequent dealings with the colonists, and they were forced to surrender much of their land rights to pay back trading debts. By 1777, all Mohegan lands had been ceded to the government of Connecicut. Around 1773, their fellow tribesman and Presbyterian Minister Samson Occum converted about 300 Mohegan; but finding that this did not improve their landless situation in Connecticut, he led these “Brotherton Indians” to accept the Oneidan invitation to share land in upstate New York.

By 1755, some had moved slightly west to inhabit the areas now known as Amherst, Nelson, and Bedford, Virgnia, where accounts variously claimed they were either peacable or troublesome. In 1786 the town of Lynchburg was established, in which both White and Native American people lived.

The Montauk were thoroughly integrated into the European economic sphere by 1750 (if not earlier), in which they worked as whalers, farmers, craftsmen, and perhaps most significantly, wampum producers (wampum was an important fur-trading currency at this time).

In 1740 the Moravians missionized the Mahican village of Shekomeko in New York. Missionaries and converts abandoned the town in 1746 because of colonist difficulties, and temporarily relocated to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which had been founded in 1741 as a base for missionary activities among the Delaware. Refugees then traveled to found Gnaddenhutten, Pennsylvania in 1746. This was attacked and burned in 1755, the surviving Moravian Indians forced to relocate once again to Nain  and Wechquetank, Pennsylvania, or possibly Ontario. After the Seven Years War the Moravian Indians moved to Wyalusing Valley, where they founded a second Friedenshutten. Land disputes pressured them to relocate to Ohio Country. In 1772, missionaries founded Schoenbrunn, Lichtenau, and a second Gnaddenhutten along the Muskingum River in Ohio. These towns were prosperous until the Revolutionary War, during which residents of the later were massacred by a Pennsylvania militia in 1782. In 1792 most of the remaining Moravian Indians established Fairfield (also known as Moraviantown) along the Thames River in Ontario, which was burned in the War of 1812 and later rebuilt somewhat more south.

With population reduced by war and disease, and communication networks disrupted by increasing colonial settlement, the Powhatan were unable to mobilize their isolated remnants and so lapsed into separate, smaller peoples.

As Florida was Spanish territory at the time, tensions regarding slave runaways and land greed simmered along the Georgia border. These finally erupted in the First Seminole War (1817) with Andrew Jackson marching a body of troops across the border, after which Spain ceded Florida in the Adams-Onis Treaty (1819). In the 1823 Treaty of Camp Moultrie, the US guaranteed the Seminole a reservation in central and southern Florida, but after the Indian Removal Act in 1830 and more specifically the Treaty of Payne’s Landing (1832), this was revoked in favor of  new territory east of the Mississippi. As a result, the Second Seminole War occurred in 1835, during which the Seminole employed devastating guerilla tactics against an unprepared US army and heavily taxed its resources. The Seminole war leader Osceola was captured in 1837 during parley, after which most Seminole begin moving to Oklahoma.

The next year, it selected officers and ratified a constitution. The first step taken was a report on the causes of pauperism – in fact, the society viewed themselves more as preventative investigators than as a relief agency. When the report claimed most indigence was the result of moral failure, the society sent ward visitors to instruct the poor about industrious habits and recorded further data. Intemperance, education, workhouses. Discounted charity for the “artificially” poor, and eventually recommended gutting aid to the able-bodied. Help the poor help themselves through short-lived initiatives like the savings bank (1819) and fuel fund (1821). Another Society, based on the New York model, opened in Baltimore 1820. They worked closely with municipal government. Disbanded in 1823, after which most of its leaders moved on to work on educational and youth projects. ",,,"Mohl, Raymond A.

The movement quickly grew, but because of persecution from the established Anglican Church, many Quakers sought the economic opportunities and religious toleration of the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island colonies in America. Quakers were distinguished by their belief in the priesthood of all believers, refusal to wage war, emphasis on direct religious experience, and striving to ""bear witness"" throughout the course of everyday life. This scrupulosity greatly influenced William Penn's dealings with the Indians in Pennsylvania, as he systematically bought land rights from all tribes concerned and occasionally purchased the same tract multiple times. For this reason, Penn earned the friendly Indian nickname “Onas,” and Quakers in general gained an early reputation for honesty and fairmindedness among the Native Americans. In the late 18th century, American yearly meetings formed Indian Committees specifically to aid Indian Tribes in maneuvering land claims and learning western agricultural skills, which they continued to work into the 19th century.",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Society-of-Friends;https://www.jstor.org/stable/985436?seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents,

Originally weak and unicameral, the system was refined in 1789 by the ratification of the Constitution, which split Congress into the Senate and the House of Representatives and affected a compromise between equal and proportional state representation. Its early history was wracked by debate between the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties, who differed on the powers and limits of central government. After the election of 1800, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican Party dominated Congress and made strong movements for state rights. After 1826, parties realigned into the Whig and Democrat factions, which grappled over populism and the strictness of the Constitution. Laws about land ownership came to the forefront, a particular concern being Native American rights and their effect on expansion. Congress had maintained an organ for Indian relations since at least 1806 and finally created the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824, while passage of the Civilization Fund Act (1819) enacted President Washington’s civilization policy by funding organizations to educate Native American tribes. In 1830, Congress passed the controversial Indian Removal Act, which in theory authorized President Jackson to make treaties with southern tribes that exchanged their homeland for territory west of the Mississippi River, and in fact resulted in forced relocations.","The organizational type, ""government,"" includes governmental bodies and other agents of the government like elected or appointed officials and members of the military.",usag,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Congress,

The government under the Articles of Confederation opened much of this territory for westward expansion through the Northwest Land Ordinance in 1785, which sparked the Northwest Indian War against an Indian Confederacy supported by the still-vexed English. This ended with General Anthony Wayne’s decisive victory at Fallen Timbers in 1794. Concurrently, States' delegates drafted a new Constitution in 1787 that created a much stronger central government. Particularly in the mid-Atlantic states at this time, the federal and state governments entered into multiple land treaties with Indian tribes that pushed them further west or onto reservations. President Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase (1803) effectively doubled the territory of the nation and expanded it west of the Mississippi River, increasing the scope of settlement and the limits of Indian relocation. Indian Nations finally lost English support with the end of the War of 1812 and Tecumseh’s wars, and with the publication of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, settler expansion occurred at a rapid pace.

They first encountered Europeans early in 17th century, with an epidemic following in the years 1615-1619. The Wampanoag helped the Pilgrims in the first couple years of Plymouth colony. These peaceful relations ended with the influx of Puritans around 1630, who acted more aggressively towards natives and, with the inadvertant help of novel diseases, pushed them westward. After 1650, the Puritans missionizing Wampanoag villages. In response to these new pressures, the Wampanoag Chief Metacomet launched King Phillip’s War (1675-1676), an uprising of various New England tribes. The population was decimated; those not killed or enslaved were forced to relocate to the praying towns of converted Indians or else to the Mashpee Reservation on Cape Cod. In 1788, Massachusetts revoked the Wampanoag right to self-government, which was only partially returned in 1834.

Their population reduced shortly thereafter, likely the result of disease and intertribal warfare, thus encouraging intermarriage with (and adoption of cultural practices) neighboring Algonkian tribes. The Ho-Chunk fought against the Patriots in the Revolutionary War, and afterwards fought the fledgling US government in both Tecumseh’s Rebellion and the War of 1812. With the passing of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, they ceded much of their southern Wisconsin territory and moved north, but not without resistance, as their participation in the Winnebago (1827) and Black Hawk (1832) Wars shows. The Ho-Chunk then signed an 1837 Treaty ceding all Wisconsin territory, but frequently ignored the terms and returned to their old homes. Those that did relocate traveled to Iowa, Minnesota, North Daktoa, and finally to a Nebraska Reservation (1865), from which many eventually returned to Wisconsin.

Iroquian-speaking. The Wyandot formed out of the remaining Petun and Huron peoples who, after battles with the Iroquois in the mid 17th century, relocated to the Upper Great Lakes area. Due to their propensity for alliance-making, they played an important role in the field of European-Indian relationships, alternately playing off the French and the Iroquois for advantages in the fur trade. They relocated to Detroit 1704 and began to hunt in Ohio (around Sandusky River), where English first contacted them. The Wyandot sided with the British in the Revolutionary War, after which they made major Ohio and Michigan land cessions through the Treaties of Greenville (1795), Detroit (1807), and Maumee Rapids (1817), retaining only some reservations along the Sandusky River. In 1842, pressured by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Wyandot ceded their remaining Ohio and Michigan lands to relocate to Kansas (near what would become Kansas City). After the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act, they signed a treaty in 1855 that alloted Wyandot lands individually and gave the option of US citizenship. In 1858, the Seneca offered a stip of land stretching between the Missouri and Neosho Rivers in Oklahoma, where most Wyandot relocated after the Civil War. ",,,Handbook of the North American Indians ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people,
